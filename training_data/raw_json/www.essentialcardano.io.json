    "prompt": "Approaching full P2P node operations?",
    "completion": "Author: Marcin Szamotulski\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) networking is a key contributor to the long-term decentralization, security, and resilience of blockchains, enabling P2P communication, data synchronization, and consensus among participants.\nIn March 2023, Dynamic P2P automated the peer selection process. Enabled by the node v.1.35.6 release, it enhanced communication between distributed nodes, simplifying the operation of relay and block-producing nodes, and eliminating the need for static configurations and manual input from stake pool operators (SPOs).\nThe next (and final) waypoint in the journey toward full P2P node operations is planned to arrive with the upcoming Ouroboros Genesis release. Genesis is scheduled to be deployed as part of the Chang upgrade, targeted for this summer. This will allow nodes to self-bootstrap from the live Cardano network.\nCurrently, initial network entry requires syncing from a safe, trusted validator usually a trusted fellow SPO or another entity. Once nodes are synchronized, they operate in a decentralized manner, using Ouroboros Praos. Ouroboros Genesis will simplify the process further when utilizing the P2P capabilities of cardano-node, the process will be entirely autonomous, eliminating the need for human intervention.\nThe process of moving from the current hybrid model towards full P2P networking is a gradual one, and the transition is already underway. According to PoolTool, around 65 of SPOs have upgraded to node v.8.7.3 released in December, and 5 have upgraded to v.8.9.0 which has the latest version of P2P. In a joint effort, engineers from IOG and the Cardano Foundation will continue to identify, contact, and inform individual SPOs to ensure that they are running sufficient relays to support P2P, and are communicating with wallets, DApps, exchanges, and other node users to ensure that they upgrade their nodes as necessary.\nWhen an individual node experiences extended downtime or falls out of synchronization with the network, it must undergo a self-bootstrap process. This also applies to new nodes joining the network. As an interim measure preceding the deployment of Ouroboros Genesis, IOG and EMURGO will offer users a new dedicated bootstrap network Genesis Lite consisting of approximately 20 trusted nodes. This trusted bootstrap relay network will scale with demand and will facilitate node bootstrapping from the Cardano Genesis configuration. Newly bootstrapped nodes must follow an up-to-date and trusted node initially, then switch to P2P when close to the current tip. In previous versions, this transition needed to be performed manually by node owners specifying the slot in the topology file.\nTimely upgrading by node owners will be crucial for the seamless rollout of full P2P and for maintaining the necessary quality of service for the Cardano network. While migrating toward a full P2P system, all node owners will need to upgrade their nodes to versions that fully support P2P mechanisms. Users should also ensure that their service providers have completed the upgrades. This applies to DApp providers, exchanges, wallet providers, explorers, other tooling, and stake pools.\nIOG is now upgrading Daedalus, Lace, Nami, and other tools that it supports to conform with the new P2P tooling. The Adrestia team at the Cardano Foundation is also working on an upgrade for the wallet backend. DB Sync will continue to work without change. IOG and the CF engineering teams along with the SPO community will continue to monitor network performance and quality of service daily and communicate with key stakeholders regularly.\nAll SPOs, exchanges, DApp developers, infrastructure providers, and other node users have this week been encouraged to upgrade to the latest node v. 8.9.0 and to run all their relay nodes in P2P mode. Block producers firewalled behind an SPO s relay nodes can also use P2P mode on their block-producing nodes with useLedgerAfterSlot set to -1, or they can continue to communicate with their relay nodes using legacy networking if they prefer. Tool providers also have the option to configure their own custom topology using local roots in their topology file with useLedgerAfterSlot set to -1 to disable peer discovery.\nuseLedgerAfterSlot\n-1\nuseLedgerAfterSlot\nIf you are an SPO, infrastructure provider, or Cardano builder and want to learn more about what you need to do to support these efforts, you can jump into the P2P operational channel here.\nOr if you haven't joined the Discord server yet, you can do that here.\nP2P P2P\n2023 3 Dynamic P2P v.1.35.6 SPO\nP2P Ouroboros Genesis Genesis Chang Cardano\nSPO Ouroboros Praos Ouroboros Genesis cardano-node P2P\nP2P PoolTool SPO 65 12 v.8.7.3 5 P2P v.8.9.0 IOG Cardano SPO P2P DApp\nOuroboros Genesis IOG EMURGO 20 Genesis Lite Cardano Genesis TIP P2P\nP2P Cardano P2P P2P DApp\nIOG Daedalus Lace Nami P2P Cardano Adrestia DB Sync IOG Cardano SPO\n** SPO DApp v.8.7.3 P2P **SPO useLedgerAfterSlot -1 P2P useLedgerAfterSlot -1\nSPO Cardano P2P\nDiscord\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Unlocking more opportunities with PlutusV3?",
    "completion": "PlutusV3, now available for testing on SanchoNet, introduces advanced Plutus primitives and so provides more tools for developers and unlocks more possibilities for writing smart contracts.\nImproved developer experience and smart contract adoption are critical to the flourishing smart contract landscape on Cardano. Over the past year, the emergence and growth of a host of community-built developer tooling and alternative languages have added significantly to developer options and the vibrancy of the Cardano builder ecosystem. To continue building out capability, the Plutus and cryptography teams at Input Output Global (IOG) in collaboration with MLabs worked on PlutusV3, focusing on performance, throughput, smart contract size, and platform capabilities. With an enriched developer toolkit and better operational efficiency, this upgrade not only reduces costs but also helps bring in new developers.\nPlutusV3 is the new ledger language that enhances Plutus Core's cryptographic capabilities, enabling Cardano to conform with the latest industry standards. The Valentine upgrade a year ago added support for SECP elliptic curves (ECDSA and Schnorr).\nThe introduction of new cryptographic primitives with V3 helps developers meet industry best practices, use well-known and optimal cryptographic algorithms, port smart contracts from Ethereum, and create sidechain bridges. Besides cryptographic primitives, PlutusV3 improves performance by adding a sums of products (SOPs) feature to support the direct encoding of different data types. Finally, V3 provides an updated script context that will let users see CIP-1694 governance-related entities.\nLet s take a closer look at the new functions.\nA common way of encoding data types in Plutus Core is by using the Scott approach. PlutusV3 introduces sums of products a way of encoding data types that leads to smaller and cheaper scripts compared with Scott encoding.\nThe sums of products approach aims to boost script efficiency and improve code generation for Plutus Core compilers. The changes involve new term constructors for packing fields into constructor values and efficient tag inspection for case branches. The benefit is the potential for programs to run 30 faster, which is a significant performance optimization, streamlining operations and ensuring swift execution of smart contracts. For more details, see CIP-85.\nCentral to every blockchain is the use of cryptographic primitives, encompassing hash functions, digital signatures, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems. These foundational elements are crafted for computational efficiency, ensuring robust security tailored to their respective applications. The outcome is a set of security assurances that establish a trustless ecosystem, facilitating smooth engagement with Cardano's peer-to-peer (P2P) network and its decentralized applications (DApps).\nIn the Plutus language, built-in functions are those not explicitly defined within the script but are part of the language's runtime environment. Using these functions allows the interpreter to furnish an optimized implementation specific to its system when executing the script. Built-in functions execute frequently-used, well-defined operations, encompassing arithmetic, control, and other crucial tasks. As we delve into PlutusV3, let's explore the new built-in primitives that will enrich the language's capabilities:\nBLS12-381 this curve pairing includes 17 primitives that support cryptographic curves, opening doors to seamless sidechain specification implementation and Mithril integration.\nBlake2b-224 a cryptographic hash function for on-chain computation of public-key hashes for the validation of transaction signatures. Implementation of Blake2b-224 supports community projects, contributing to Cardano's versatility and adoption by accommodating various applications.\nKeccak-256 a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, commonly used for secure data verification. Keccak-256 supports Ethereum signature verification within scripts. This is crucial for cross-chain solutions and facilitates community projects by expanding use cases on Cardano.\nThe introduction of CIP-58 bitwise primitives will provide developers with robust capabilities for low-level bit manipulations. This addition offers developers profound benefits in both performance optimization and cryptographic functionality. With their incremental deployment plan, bitwise primitives ensure a seamless integration process and foster a robust environment for developers to build powerful and efficient solutions on Cardano.\nBitwise primitives enable the following features:\nPerformance boost. Bitwise primitives introduce the capability for very low-level bit manipulations within Plutus. This capability lays the foundation for executing high-performance data manipulation operations, a crucial aspect for developers seeking efficient solutions. CIP-58 will add a class of low-level functions for highly efficient algorithms and data structures.\nCryptographic support. Bitwise primitives are essential for supporting cryptographic functions. These primitives allow the implementation of secure and robust cryptographic algorithms within Plutus.\nInteger-bytestring conversions for smooth integration. Bitwise primitives facilitate standard, high-performance implementations for conversions between integers and bytestrings. This ability is essential because the primitives require arguments in bytestring format, while data is often presented in integer format.\nThe Plutus upgrade will add two bitwise primitives: integerToByteString and byteStringToInteger. The remaining primitives will be added to PlutusV3 gradually. Going forward, such upgrades won t require a new ledger language. This incremental deployment approach ensures a systematic integration of these powerful features into the Plutus language.\nintegerToByteString\nbyteStringToInteger\nStarting with the release of Cardano node v.8.8.0-pre, PlutusV3 is now available on SanchoNet, introducing the Cardano community to governance features from CIP-1694 in a controlled testnet environment.\nAmong its benefits, PlutusV3 offers greater efficiency, optionality, and ease of use to the Cardano builder community all key to nurturing developer adoption. Prioritizing aspects such as performance, throughput, smart contract size, and platform capabilities ensures that Cardano developers can use the latest standards. These improvements facilitate the smooth migration of smart contracts from Ethereum, enable the creation of sidechain bridges, and ultimately contribute to the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem.\nFollow IOG X (Twitter) for further announcements.\nPlutusV3\nSanchoNet PlutusV3 Plutus\nCardano 1 Cardano Input Output Global IOG Plutus MLabs PlutusV3\nPlutusV3 Plutus Core Cardano 1 Valentine SECP ECDSA Schnorr\nV3 PlutusV3 SOP Sums Of Products CIP-1694\nPlutus Core Scott PlutusV3 Scott SOP\nSOP Plutus Core 30 CIP-85\nZKP Cardano P2P DApp\nPlutus PlutusV3\nBLS12-381 17 Mithril\nBlake2b-224 Blake2b-224 Cardano\nKeccak-256 256 32 Keccak-256 Cardano\nCIP-58 Cardano\nPlutus CIP-58\nPlutus\nPlutus integerToByteString byteStringToInteger 2 PlutusV3 Plutus\nCardano v.8.8.0-pre PlutusV3 SanchoNet Cardano CIP-1694\nPlutusV3 Cardano Cardano Cardano\nIOG X Twitter\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Engineering dive into Cardanos Dynamic P2P design?",
    "completion": "This blog post was originally published on the engineering blog.\nAs the Cardano ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, contributors to the Cardano ecosystem are committed to continually refining and optimizing Cardano's networking infrastructure. The release of Dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, delivered with node v.1.35.6, was a collaborative effort of the networking team from IOG, Well-Typed, PNSol, and the Cardano Foundation and represents a highly performant deliverable and a significant milestone in Cardano's journey toward establishing a fully decentralized and secure blockchain platform.\nGiven that Cardano functions as a real-time stochastic system, its performance and security are inherently interconnected. The networking team remains committed to finding the ideal balance among various factors, including topological and topographic considerations, to enhance timeliness and connectivity.\nThis blog post takes you through the engineering journey behind the development of Cardano's Dynamic P2P design. It delves into the core design principles, highlights the challenges encountered along the way, and unveils the solutions the team devised to establish a robust and scalable networking system.\nThe Dynamic P2P implementation continuously and dynamically refines the active topology through a peer selection process, with the objective of reducing the overall diffusion time across the entire network. Research findings suggest that utilizing a policy based solely on local information can result in an almost-optimal global outcome. This is achieved by monitoring the timeliness and frequency of peers that provide a block header, which is ultimately incorporated into the chain.\nThe primary goal is to eliminate highly non-optimal peers while maintaining strong connectivity. To achieve this, peers considered less useful based on this metric are periodically churned out and replaced with randomly selected alternatives. Simulation results indicate that this optimization method converges towards a near-optimal global outcome within a relatively small number of iterations.\nPractically, Dynamic P2P replaces the manual configuration of peer selection (e.g. using the topology updater tool).\nWith manual configuration, stake pool operators (SPOs) were required to establish connections with a significant number of peers (50 for example) to maintain a minimum of 20 active connections consistently. This approach was necessary due to the static nature of configured peers and the varying availability of SPO relays.\nHowever, with Dynamic P2P, nodes can be configured to maintain a specific number of active peer connections (e.g. 20) and select from all registered SPO relays on the chain. In the event of a lost connection with a peer, the node will automatically select alternative peers and persistently attempt connections until the desired target is reached.\nAs a result, Dynamic P2P eliminates the requirement for over-provisioning of connections, offering a more efficient and adaptable networking solution.\nCardano operates as a cooperative system composed of autonomous nodes. It is not designed as a client-server model, meaning there is no central point of control or privileged class of centrally managed servers. While the network topology may have initially started as federated during the Byron development phase, the objective was to evolve it into a fully trustless distributed networking system capable of meeting the evolving demands of the Cardano ecosystem all while ensuring optimal connectivity and performance.\nAs the networking team embarked on this engineering adventure, they were well aware that they would encounter numerous challenges and complexities along the way. However, they faced these challenges head-on, continuously refining the core ideas that would ultimately shape the design of the Dynamic P2P system:\nModularity and extensibility: the system was designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to swap out or improve individual components as needed. This extensibility allows for seamless integration of new features and enhancements, ensuring that the design remains adaptive to the evolving needs of the Cardano ecosystem. Modularity is especially helpful when formal methods are applied to prove the correctness of low-level designs in relation to high-level specifications. By breaking down the system into smaller, more manageable components, it becomes possible to apply property-based testing to each module more effectively, ensuring that each part s behavior is well-defined and adheres to the expected properties. Of course, the choice of functional programming with Haskell as the primary programming language played a significant role in achieving this level of modularity and extensibility.\nScalability: as the network grows, the demand for a system capable of handling a larger number of nodes and transactions while respecting Ouroboros timing constraints also increases. To address this scalability requirement in the P2P design vision, the team considered scalability properties from the very beginning and incorporated strategies such as intelligent peer selection.\nSecurity and resilience: in a decentralized network, resilience and security are of paramount importance. The goal was to construct a system capable of withstanding internal and external disruptions. To achieve this, the networking team implemented robust error handling mechanisms designed for resilience against abuse, ensuring that users cannot attack the system through asymmetric denial of service attacks that deplete network resources for other users. With the P2P approach, each node can prioritize its connection to locally configured peers. This ensures that the node maintains a connection to trusted peers and can make progress in the network. Inbound connections are rate limited, and configurable peer targets allow the node to adjust its resource consumption. Additionally, careful management of connection states enables reusing duplex connections, allowing nodes behind firewalls to safely improve their connectivity while reducing the overall attack surface.\nPerformance: a highly-performant network is crucial for ensuring a seamless user experience. Substantial effort was invested into optimizing the design by employing techniques such as efficient data transmission through multiplexing and utilizing protocols that support pipelining. Additionally, intelligent peer selection plays a vital role in reducing latency and ensuring a responsive and reliable network.\nEstablishing effective communication within the Cardano network requires achieving low latency and good connectivity. To fulfill these essential requirements, Dynamic P2P was designed to ensure a robust, scalable, and resilient foundation for the ecosystem's continued growth. However, it is important to recognize that peer trustworthiness is a critical factor in maintaining a secure and reliable network. While delving into the details of trustworthiness is beyond the scope of this blog post, it is worth noting that the P2P design incorporates multiple measures to mitigate potential risks and safeguard the network.\nEnsuring Ouroboros performance and security is crucial, and one critical aspect of this is the timely relay of new blocks across the network. Ideally, the connections within the P2P network should be organized in a way that minimizes the time required for a block to be relayed from any node to all other nodes in the network.\nHowever, achieving this goal presents a complex challenge, with limited prior work available that is applicable in a trustless setting. Effectively addressing this problem necessitated the development of innovative solutions that could strike a balance between swift communication and maintaining the integrity and security of the decentralized network.\nAn effective solution for optimizing performance involves minimizing the number of hops a block needs to traverse across the network. In graph terms, this translates to reducing the average number of edges a block traverses. Moreover, the length of each hop or edge is crucial. Local links exhibit lower latency compared to intercontinental links, although some intercontinental links are necessary for global block relay. For example, a sub-optimal solution would involve excessive intercontinental links, such as routing from Europe to Asia and back.\nExisting networking algorithms can generate optimal spanning trees that could serve as paths for block relay. However, these algorithms rely on nodes trusting each other to exchange accurate information, which is unsuitable for a blockchain P2P network where nodes cannot inherently trust each other.\nAn ideal solution should rely on local rather than global information information that nodes can assess individually without relying on shared and trusted data. Nevertheless, having an optimal solution that depends on perfect global information can serve as a valuable reference point.\nThe networking team collaborated with network researchers from Athens University, who specialize in decentralized systems and their protocols, to undertake a crucial task simulating different network policies and studying the trade-offs in diffusion time.\nThe pivotal question regarding dissemination is determining which nodes should forward blocks to each other, or, more precisely, which dissemination links should be established among nodes to improve dissemination speed.\nIn tackling this question, together with the researchers we pursued two primary approaches:\nThe first approach assumes that links are independent of the dissemination process. It involves simulating a static overlay where links are established according to predefined rules. Multiple disseminations are then executed to measure the performance.\nThe second approach involves dynamically adjusting the overlay. In this approach, nodes initially establish connections with random nodes in the network and continuously monitor the performance statistics of their neighbors. Periodically, each node adjusts its set of neighbors based on these statistics, deciding which neighbors to retain and which ones to replace.\nFigure 1. Close-Random policy comparison\nThe plot demonstrates the rapid dissemination of a block throughout the network, reaching all nodes eventually. In this experiment, all nodes use the exact same Close-Random policy e.g. C6R4 means nodes connect to six close peers and four random peers. Initially, all nodes are uninformed, meaning they have not yet received the specific block. However, they become informed at some point during the experiment. The dotted line represents the theoretical optimal solution, assuming all informed nodes possess complete knowledge of which peers are most advantageous, enabling such connections (god's view policy).\nIt is important to clarify that the Close-Random policy was not implemented directly. Rather, it was employed as a practical theoretical tool. It strikes a balance by incorporating non-local factors while remaining simple enough to be approximated using only local information.\nThis analysis demonstrates how close it is possible to get to an ideal solution using primarily local information. What's intriguing is that this approach surpasses expectations. Achieving a result within a factor of two of perfection would have been commendable, but the team discovered that it is possible to surpass even that.\nFigure 2. Close-Random policy vs two groups calibration\nFigure 2 compares the outcomes from the two approaches described earlier. The simulation involved each node maintaining six close neighbors (based on Round Trip Time (RTT)), and four random nodes. These links were kept static throughout the entire experiment (hence the constant blue lines). In the two groups ( =100ms and 100ms) policy, each node maintains a fixed number of close links and remote links: close signifies that the RTT to that neighbor is less or equal to 100 ms, while remote implies that the RTT is more than 100 ms. Nodes start with all random links and periodically calibrate. During this calibration, they retain up to a fixed number of neighbors that have an RTT of less than 100 ms, and they replace some of the remaining neighbors with newly picked random nodes.\nThis two groups policy serves as a straightforward, effective approximation for evaluating scoring policy behavior. It's worth noting, however, that this policy isn't the one currently employed.\nFigure 3. Close-Random policy vs Peer Score\nIn Figure 3, a comparative analysis is presented between the outcomes resulting from the previously discussed Close-Random policy and a different peer scoring policy. This alternative policy evaluates peers based on the frequency with which they supply a new block header to the node before others. In this experimental setup, nodes start with random links and periodically undergo calibration. During these calibration intervals, the bottom-performing 20 or 40 of peers are replaced with new, randomly selected nodes.\nThe blue line in the graph represents the policy currently being used (further details about this can be found in the subsequent section). The green line illustrates the theoretical optimum.\nUpon close examination of this graph, and drawing comparisons to the previous one, we can identify key variations in the effectiveness of the different scoring policies. Nonetheless, it's critical to keep in mind that these variations are not directly comparable due to the different parameters applied in each experiment. Some experiments measure complete dissemination time, while others consider the 99th percentile, which represents a slightly lower value. Moreover, latency traces between nodes differ across experiments, leading to distinct results.\nIn this context, the 99th percentile for the 20 policy shows a lower equilibrium compared to the two groups. However, this is not a direct 'apples to apples' comparison due to the reasons stated above.\nThe policy that we currently employ goes beyond the use of RTT when selecting peers. In our quest for a more robust and reliable approach, we sought an alternative that would accurately reflect a peer's usefulness. This brought us to the concept of rewarding peers for being the first to present a node with a new header or block. This approach presents an authentic measure of a peer's contribution to the network, and unlike RTT, it cannot be easily manipulated or faked.\nIn the Dynamic P2P design, each node maintains a local view of the network and evaluates potential connections considering historical performance. Nodes continuously monitor and adjust their connections, seeking better performing peers to optimize their network position and minimize the number of hops required for block relay.\nEach node maintains three sets of known peer nodes:\nCold peers: known peers without an established network connection.\nWarm peers: peers with an established bearer connection, used for network measurements but not for any application-level consensus protocols, their primary role is to serve as a readily available set of nodes.\nHot peers: peers with an active bearer connection, utilized for the application-level consensus protocols.\nAs previously mentioned, nodes maintain limited information about these peers, based on previous direct interactions. For cold nodes, this information may often be absent due to the lack of prior direct interactions. This information resembles reputation in other systems, but it is essential to emphasize that it is purely local and not shared with any other node.\nFigure 4. Peer discovery on Cardano\nFigure 4 illustrates the promotion/demotion cycle, managed by the peer selection governor (PSG). This component is responsible for achieving specific targets, such as maintaining a designated number of known and active peers.\nAdditionally, a local static configuration can be utilized to designate certain nodes as hot or warm peers. This approach allows for fixed relationships between nodes managed by a single organization, such as a stake pool with multiple relays. It also facilitates private peering arrangements between SPOs and other potential deployment scenarios.\nIn cases of adversarial behavior, a peer can be immediately demoted from the hot, warm, and cold sets. The decision is not to retain negative peer information for extended periods to limit resource consumption in a permissionless system, as doing so could potentially simplify Sybil attacks.\nThe peer churn governor (PCG) is a component that plays a pivotal role in managing the health and efficiency of a network by navigating issues related to network partition and eclipse attacks, by adjusting the values of the targets for hot, warm, and cold peers so as to promote their churning.\nIn this process, the PCG modifies the frequency at which peers are promoted (upgraded from cold to warm, or warm to hot) or demoted (downgraded from hot to warm, or warm to cold). This decision is guided by scoring functions that evaluate peers based on their usefulness and performance.\nThese scoring functions include:\nHot demotion policy: responsible for determining which hot (highly active and valuable) peers should be demoted. The score is calculated based on a peer's contribution to the network, considering factors such as the number of blocks it has been the first to provide and/or the number of bytes it has provided. During normal operation, a combination of these factors is used to compute the score. However, during bulk sync data synchronization, the number of bytes provided takes precedence.\nWarm demotion policy and cold forget policy: handle warm and cold peers, determining which peers should be downgraded or removed from the network. These decisions are influenced by a certain level of randomness and various characteristics. Factors taken into account include previous failures or a tepidity flag, which indicates less reliability or lower activity levels in peers.\nDuring the node syncing process, the PCG ensures that no more than two active connections are utilized to prevent resource over-utilization. Once the node is fully synced, the PCG facilitates periodic churn, refreshing 20 of the peers every hour. This promotes a robust and adaptable network.\nWhile the Close-Random or Score-based policies explored in the research are not directly replicated in the production environment, they have significantly influenced the design of the implemented policies. Thus, the research findings have played a crucial role in shaping the networking policies within the Cardano production environment.\nCardano's P2P implementation is built upon Haskell, a functional programming language widely recognized for its correctness, safety, and maintainability. Haskell's robust type system aids in the detection of potential issues during development, resulting in more robust and reliable code. Additionally, the networking team have developed and now employ io-sim, a time-based discrete event simulation library that offers precise control over entropy and timing in simulations. This tool faithfully replicates Haskell's runtime system, including features such as Software Transactional Memory (STM), _MVar_s, and more. This level of control allows for reproducibility, regression testing, and examination of worst-case scenarios. The combination of Haskell and io-sim allows rigorous testing of the same code used in the P2P production system under a wide range of conditions, ensuring its readiness to tackle real-world challenges.\nio-sim\nIn the commitment to building a reliable system, the networking team employed extensive property-based testing. These tests were specifically designed to uncover complex bugs and corner cases that might go unnoticed in traditional testing approaches like unit testing. One distinctive aspect of the testing process is the inclusion of simulations that replicate years of system operation. This comprehensive approach allows mimicking years' worth of activity, uncovering rare bugs that may only surface under specific or prolonged conditions.

    "prompt": "Dynamic P2P is available on mainnet?",
    "completion": "Dynamic P2P networking is an important evolution for Cardano and a further boost to the network's performance, resilience, and decentralization. By automating the peer selection process, Dynamic P2P enables enhanced communication between distributed nodes and simplifies the process of running a relay or a block-producing node. This eliminates the need for static configurations and manual stake pool operators (SPO) input.\nDynamic P2P comes as a built-in functionality with node v.1.35.6 release today. The SPO community is now encouraged to test P2P functionality by updating one of their relays to use the P2P topology mode. Over the next few weeks, IOG and CF teams together with the SPO community will be assessing network connectivity to ensure a smooth rollout of Dynamic P2P functionality.\nHere s more about the evolution of the Cardano network and the features that Dynamic P2P brings.\nCardano's networking protocols combine nodes and their interactions into a unified system using standard communication infrastructure. The network distributes information about transactions and blocks to all active nodes.\nThere are two ways to configure a Cardano node:\nAs a block-producing node responsible for producing blocks on the Cardano blockchain. SPOs run block-producing nodes that require incoming connections to receive block information and outgoing connections to propagate generated blocks. P2P will enable bi-directional usage of each connection, so the order of connections will not matter.\nAs a relay node, responsible for communicating with other relays in the network and broadcasting blocks from block-producing nodes. Relay nodes also act as a defense layer for block producers to ensure that block producers are not directly exposed to the whole internet.\nThe network s design aims to minimize communication delays and maximize network resilience against failures, capacity constraints, or malicious behavior.\nIOG has always recommended that SPOs deploy at least two relay nodes for each block-producing node to ensure that the system adds blocks and verifies transactions effectively. This strengthens security and deters denial of service (DoS) attacks.\nAs mentioned in a previous post, Cardano's networking evolved from its initial federated structure to hybrid and the current P2P model. Networking will keep evolving with future additions such as Ouroboros Genesis and peer-sharing:\nFederated: introduced in the Byron development phase in 2017, IOG core and relay nodes maintained the network and connected users, wallets, and exchanges.\nHybrid: since the Shelley development phase in 2020, block-producing nodes send and receive communications through trusted relays and/or a manual community-developed and managed tool called the topology updater.\nDynamic P2P: currently being released, Dynamic P2P provides automation and resilience to optimize network performance. SPO relays can automatically connect to each other through self-discovery and optimization.\nOuroboros Genesis: in development. Anyone running their own node or Daedalus wallet will connect to a fully decentralized and self-organized network.\nPeer sharing: in development. Peer sharing will facilitate the discovery of potential peers that are not registered on the chain within the overall Cardano node network. This phase will also allow anyone to contribute to running the network, rather than just using resources from SPOs.\nCurrently, block-producing nodes require both incoming and outgoing connections to receive and propagate blocks. However, the selection (in the configuration) of these connections is a manual task done with the topology updater tool. This tool helps SPOs to configure their nodes to connect to other nodes in the network and also receive updates about network changes (eg, stake, performance, or availability).\nSPOs need to spend time and effort running the tool manually. When updating their relays, SPOs also need to ensure that their block-producing nodes are connected to the network, otherwise, they may miss a block-producing slot and any rewards.\nDynamic P2P enables automated connection of SPO relays to each other through self discovery and optimization, thus removing the need for static configuration and the manual SPO maintenance required by the hybrid setup. P2P makes the network more performant and resilient to changes such as node or routing failures, and also streamlines the flow of information between the thousands of distributed nodes.\nP2P doesn t just automate the selection of the static configuration, it is more dynamic than that. Currently, SPOs might configure a node to connect to, for example, 50 other SPO nodes. This is a pretty large number, since many nodes can be offline, change their addresses, etc. While 20 connections are enough for efficient communication, SPOs may have to over-provision because of the static configuration.\nIn a Dynamic P2P setup, SPOs can target to configure 20 connections, which can be picked from thousands of SPO relays, not just 50. And if any are offline, or go offline, the setup will automatically pick new ones, to meet the set target. This means that the configuration is no longer limited to a static pool of 50 peers.\nP2P also allows for more sophisticated configurations for direct peering arrangements between SPOs. For example, if two SPOs want to maintain a connection between their relays, and each has two relays, they can configure a group of peers that lists the other SPOs two relays but with a target that there should be at least one connection. This means that there is no need for over-provisioning, and SPOs still get automatic failover if one relay goes down. With static configuration, one had to choose between listing only one and thus not getting resilience, or listing both and over-provisioning (using more resources).\nFinally, P2P optimizes the selection of peers to minimize the overall diffusion time in the whole network. It does this continuously and automatically. Internal IOG research shows that a policy based purely on local information can achieve a global outcome close to optimal. It measures the frequency with which peers are the first to provide a block header that later ends up in the chain. Peers that are least useful by this metric are periodically churned out and replaced by other randomly selected peers. Simulation results show that this simple optimization procedure method reaches a near optimal global outcome within a relatively small number of iterations, on the order of 24 hours.\nSee this technical specification for more details.\nWe re continuing to share further updates with the SPO community and invite everyone to join the SPO Telegram group and Discord channel for technical discussions.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

No worries, here s a list of essentials to get you started\nDisclaimer: Nothing in this article is intended to be professional advice, including without limitation, financial, investment, legal or tax advice. IO Global is not responsible for your use of or reliance on any information in this article.\nBlockchain is one of the most influential technologies of the 21st century. It provides solutions for more efficient business processes, data traceability, and, of course, decentralized digital payments.\nThe platform s evolution has attracted massive amounts of new users into the Cardano ecosystem. Specifically, Cardano has delivered some of the most promising features that position the platform as a secure and versatile environment for application development and enterprise deployment.\nHowever, despite the increasing numbers joining the space, getting onboard remains challenging for the average user. Onboarding often involves complex processes that lack visibility or clear information for the new user.\nSo let s say you heard about the benefits of blockchain technology and about Cardano in particular. You re now interested to see how it works and how you can benefit from it. Where to start? To streamline your Cardano journey, we have compiled a list of essential resources and some tips to get you started.\nLet s start with the blockchain basics:\nWhat is a blockchain?\nWhat is a cryptocurrency?\nWhat is consensus?\nWhat is proof of stake?\nNow that you know how a blockchain works and what a cryptocurrency is, it is time to learn more about Cardano.\nCardano aims to provide an opportunity for global communities to easily access and use the blockchain in their daily lives. Using blockchain, you can for example send funds to your friends, pay for products or services, or use decentralized applications (DApps). Yet, blockchain is much more than just a financial system. But first things first, here is everything you need to know about Cardano:\nYou can also go over Essential Cardano FAQs or New to Cardano section on Cardano Docs to learn more about Ouroboros, ada, and what makes Cardano a third-generation blockchain:\nWhat is Cardano?\nWhat makes Cardano a third-generation blockchain?\nHow does Cardano work?\nWhat is Ouroboros?\nWhy is Cardano called the green blockchain ?\nHaving read about the basics you re now ready to try Cardano out.\nLet s start with some simple payments. You will first need to choose and create a Cardano wallet and get some ada.\nExplore different Cardano wallet products and get the one that best suits your needs.\nHere is an article on the various types of cryptocurrency wallets and examples of wallet products/providers for Cardano to choose from: Types of wallets.\nFor desktop: Nami and Lace are simplified desktop wallets that are perfect for first-time users. Eternl and Typhon are more advanced desktop wallets that offer a number of interesting features.\nFor mobile: Vespr, Eternl, Gero, and Flint wallet are some go-to options that are largely adopted by the community.\nExplore and choose a cryptocurrency exchange (in your jurisdiction) to get some ada.\nTry out the wallet: ask a fellow Cardano community member for their wallet address and try exchanging (sending/receiving) small amounts of ada with them.\nYou're now a Cardano user experiencing the world of Web3 and crypto! You can track your transactions and account activities using Cardano Explorer. Learn how to use the tracking tools to do this: Cardano tracking tools.\nUnderstanding staking and delegation\nAs an ada holder, you own a stake that is the amount of ada you have. This means that you are now part of the Cardano network and can help maintain it. A developer or a tech-savvy person can set up a stake pool and run it to help verify transactions, create blocks, and get rewards.\nIf you are not interested in running your own pool, you can instead choose to delegate your stake to an existing pool and share its rewards. There is no risk to this as no ada leaves your wallet and you can spend your funds at anytime while they are delegated to a stake pool.\nAda holders can delegate stake using their wallets. Here are some useful articles to review:\nHow to choose a stake pool\nHow safe is it to delegate to a stake pool?\nHow to delegate to a stake pool using Daedalus\nStaking and delegating for beginners (Daedalus)\nHow to delegate to a stake pool using Flint Wallet\nThe general perspective on staking in Cardano\nWhat other wallets support staking?\nHow to stake your ada\nBeing part of decision making and innovation\nOne of the key pillars for Cardano's long-term sustainability is active community engagement and participation. The Voltaire phase of the Cardano roadmap will introduce community voting mechanisms to democratize decision-making so every ada holder can vote on Cardano s changes and upgrades.\nThe process of decentralized governance has already started. Project Catalyst is one of the world s largest decentralized innovation funds, where ada holders can vote on the most promising projects to get funded from the treasury.\nThere are many ways to get involved with Project Catalyst as an innovator, voter, commenter, proposer, proposal reviewer, community advisor, or even a mentor. The first step is creating an account on the Catalyst collaboration platform, IdeaScale.\nFind out more:\nProject Catalyst and Voltaire bring power to the people\nProject Catalyst Innovation\nCardano Catalyst community site\nLIDO NATION\nAdaPulse\nDecentralized finance or DeFi is a blockchain-based form of finance that addresses the same needs as traditional finance. The goal of DeFi is to help individuals and companies engage in financial activity without going through a central, expensive middleman such as a bank.\nThe DeFi explainer unpacks the complexity of some blockchain notions. Head over and take a look at what terms like DeFi, RealFi, DApp, DEX, liquidity, and so on mean:\nYou can now experiment with some DApps. Just like a mobile app runs on your iOS or Android device, a Cardano DApp runs on the Cardano blockchain. There are various categories of DApps, from gaming and health to finance and government applications.\nThere are a number of community-driven resources gathering information about the latest projects launched on Cardano:\nCardanoCube\nBuilt on Cardano\nCardano crowd\nAdaPulse\nEvery ada is the same as another. You can trade one ada for another and get the same value i.e. 1:1; this means that ada is fungible.\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs), on the other hand, are unique and can carry special information (metadata) that represents digital ownership rights of real-world and digital assets such as a real-estate or a 3D animation. Anyone can create their own NFTs on Cardano natively with minimal work i.e. without needing a smart contract. This is a huge difference from the error-prone complexity found on Ethereum, for example. This makes Cardano NFTs more secure, cheaper, and faster to transact with.\nNFTs have been booming recently. You can create, buy, and sell digital representations of anything - drawings, video clips, music, tweets, articles, trading cards, game items, and more. Make sure to explore:\nCardano NFTs: everything you need to know\nJPG Store: Cardano NFT marketplace\nArtano\nCardano cube: NFT projects\nTapTools\nSmart Contracts are programs that run on blockchains to perform complex (and simple) tasks. You can think of them as sophisticated ATMs or Vending machines. Smart contracts act as digital agreements that track, verify, and execute the binding parts of a deal between various parties. The contract stages are automatically executed when predetermined conditions are met.\nAs a beginner, you don t need to dive straight into how to write a smart contract. What s important to know is that DApps use smart contracts for you to experience safe deal execution.\nCardano provides the possibility to work with Plutus and Marlowe contracts:\nPlutus is a set of programming tools for developers to write smart contracts on Cardano.\nMarlowe is a domain specific language specially designed for writing financial smart contracts. It is limited to financial applications and its low-code approach means it is perfect for experts in finance rather than in programming.\nIf you re interested in learning how to write Plutus contracts, you can take part in the Plutus Pioneer program.\nIdentity is key to accessing a range of private and public services. From opening a bank account to obtaining loans or a driver's license, access to education, etc., the need to prove to others who we are is almost omnipresent in everyday life.\nAtala PRISM is a decentralized identity solution on Cardano. It enables people to own their personal data and identity to interact with organizations seamlessly, privately, and securely. Visit the Atala PRISM website for more information.\nTo conclude we should state that this is just the beginning. You have probably chosen the topics that interest you most about Cardano.

    "prompt": "What is Cardano Cardano 101?",
    "completion": "The Cardano universe is expanding with the arrival of a broad range of decentralized applications and exchanges. From games to decentralized finance (DeFi), Cardano covers the whole gamut of blockchain-based versatility.\nAs Cardano grows, so does its reach, its community, value, and adoption. This paper reflects all that Cardano is, what it represents, and what it can offer to the world.\nThe project to create Cardano was initiated by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, and entrepreneurs concentrated in Asia at the end of 2014. Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood founded Input Output (initially, IOHK) to design and implement Cardano. In addition, the Cardano Foundation was set up to oversee and supervise the development of Cardano and to act as an advocate for its users. The foundation is based in Switzerland. A third entity, Emurgo, was created to pursue commercial activities on behalf of the ecosystem and community. The three entities have separate ownership and leadership.\nThe Cardano blockchain and ada, its founding native cryptocurrency, was launched in 2017 and established itself as one of the leading blockchains.\nIOHK has evolved into Input Output Global, Inc. (IOG) with Charles Hoskinson as Chief Executive Officer. IOG is incorporated in the state of Wyoming, USA.\nAs the blockchain engineering and research company that is participating, along with the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and other third parties, in developing the core Cardano platform, IOG has assembled a multi-talented global team of more than 600 people. This includes computer scientists, academic researchers, software engineers, product specialists, and technical architects.\nWith over 600 staff (as of May 2022), IOG is an ever-expanding constellation for the development of decentralized applications, identity solutions, wallets, and an eclectic and thematically diversified range of decentralized applications for blockchain.\nCardano is a third-generation, open-source, proof-of-stake blockchain platform. Its name derives from Gerolamo Cardano, a mid-16th-century Italian physician and mathematician. Third-generation blockchain platforms are designed to resolve the issues that the first two generations (Bitcoin and Ethereum) suffer from, including scalability and interoperability while fulfilling an ambitious agenda of decentralization.\nThe Cardano platform combines pioneering technologies based on peer-reviewed research to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and communities worldwide. Cardano is about openness, fairness, and inclusivity.\nThe blockchain's proof-of-stake protocol, Ouroboros, offers a scalable and energy-efficient solution to accommodate millions and ultimately, billions of users worldwide.\nCardano's development is led by a deliberate approach to constructing a robust and reliable enterprise-grade infrastructure.\nDecentralization is one of Cardano's main drivers, built around three central pillars:\nBlock production & consensus\nNetworking\nGovernance\nThese three elements combined form a fully decentralized environment where power shifts from monopolistic entities to the individual. Decentralization dissolves the concentration of power by enabling peers to make choices and decisions and returning ownership of personal information where it belongs - to the users.\nOn March 31, 2021, Cardano's block production became fully decentralized. On that day, the stake pool operator (SPO) community began producing 100 of new blocks. This was an important milestone on the way to Cardano's ultimate destination; the creation of a platform wholly and democratically operated and controlled through a global community of SPOs, developers, and ada holders. Technology\nThe Cardano architecture features three layers:\nConsensus layer\nLedger layer\nNetwork layer\nConsensus layer\nThis layer performs two fundamental functions:\nRunning the Ouroboros consensus protocol. This layer takes decisions like adopting blocks, choosing between competing chains (if there are any), and decides when to produce blocks of its own; and\nMaintaining all the state that is required to make the decisions taken in the consensus layer.\nLedger layer\nThis layer specifies:\nWhat the state of the ledger looks like; and\nHow the ledger must be updated for each new block.\nThe ledger layer consists exclusively of pure functions that specify the transitions between successive ledger states, as derived from the formal ledger rules, using the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) accounting model. The state transitions are driven by the set of transactions contained within the Cardano blocks, and by major events such as epoch boundary transitions and hard fork combinator events.\nThe consensus layer does not need to know the exact nature of the ledger state, nor the contents of the blocks, apart from some header fields required to run the consensus protocol.\nNetwork layer\nThis layer maintains the connections between all the distributed nodes in the Cardano network, obtains new blocks from the network as they are produced by block-producing nodes, builds newly minted transactions into blocks, and transmits blocks between nodes.\nCardano uses strong cryptographic primitives to securely create and send transactions, and to protect the security and integrity of the protocol.\nCardano utilizes asymmetric key pairs for:\nSigning and validating payments and staking certificates;\nSmart contract execution\nMulti-signature transactions\nIdentifying and defining addresses on the Cardano blockchain\nKey pairs include a public and a private key. By using their private key, users provide cryptographic proof that they indeed own the coins or assets they're using.\nCryptography also provides security for the consensus protocol. The two main mechanisms are:\nNode keys, which are used to register and operate stake pools, and are sub-divided into Operator/operational key, Key Evolving Signature (KES) key pairs, Verifiable Random Function (VRF) keys; and\nPayment and stake credentials, which are used to authorize fund transfers or to delegate stake to stake pools. These may be either key hashes or script hashes.\nLearn more about Cardano's cryptography.\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) communication enables nodes to self-organize into a globally distributed network of Cardano block producers and relays, and also self-optimize, choosing the best and more performant connected nodes and disconnecting from less performant ones.\nInformation is exchanged between nodes to enable a flexible network topology that automatically adapts to dynamically changing network conditions. This further boosts network decentralization, resilience, and robustness.\nThe network's P2P architecture includes four elements:\nP2P Governor\nConnection Manager\nServer\nInbound Protocol Governor\nRead more about P2P communication in Cardano.\nRead more about Cardano s decentralization drive.\nCardano's proof-of-stake consensus protocol.\nIn mythology, Ouroboros (also, Uroboros) is usually depicted as a snake (or sometimes a dragon) eating its own tail in a closed circle. The word Ouroboros itself derives from Ancient Greek, its literal meaning being 'tail eating' or 'tail devourer.'\nAs a symbol, Ouroboros represents the infinity of time flowing back unto itself, in a never-ending cycle, as if caught in an eternal loop. Ouroboros first appeared in Egypt, in the 13th century BC. Later, alchemists adopted Ouroboros into their mystical symbolism.\nSo why was this mythical creature chosen to represent the proof-of-stake consensus protocol that underlies Cardano? In this context, Ouroboros represents the possibility of infinite and ethical growth and scalability of the blockchain, and also, the protocol feeds itself from previous epochs for the randomness used in the current epoch. This is known as eating its own tail , as the pictorial representation of Ouroboros does.\nOuroboros' central message is the delivery of greater opportunities for the world and its preservation through much-reduced energy consumption.\nOuroboros is the first provably secure proof-of-stake blockchain protocol. In other words, Ouroboros offers mathematically verifiable security against attackers. The protocol is guaranteed to be secure, as long as 51 of the stake is held by honest participants.\nOuroboros realizes what is known as Nakamoto-style consensus based on proof-of-stake. This provides the robustness of Bitcoin but ensures significant energy efficiency, higher speed, and a fair reward mechanism. Also, the protocol ensures security against network attacks and has a rigorous game-theoretic mechanism designed to discourage monopolization.\nOuroboros upgrades are smooth due to hard-fork combinator technology, which does not cause disruptions for users. There have been several flavors of Ouroboros, released in stages.\nThis is just a high-level overview of Cardano s protocol. For more information about Ouroboros, visit IOG s research library page.\nCardano uses an innovative Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) accounting model to support multi-assets and smart contracts.\nSmart contracts are digital agreements, written in code, that can be executed without an intermediary once certain conditions are met. Smart contracts make non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance applications possible.\nBuilding on Bitcoin s UTXO model, the EUTXO model provides a secure and versatile environment to process multiple operations without system failures. This model offers better scalability and privacy, as well as more simplified transaction logic, as each UTXO can only be consumed once and as a whole, which makes transaction verification much simpler.\nEUTXO offers unique advantages over other accounting models. The success or failure of transaction validation depends only on the transaction itself and its inputs, and not on anything else on the blockchain. As a consequence, the validity of a transaction can be checked off-chain, before the transaction is sent to the blockchain. A transaction can still fail if some other transaction concurrently consumes an input that the transaction is expecting, but if all inputs are still present, the transaction is guaranteed to succeed.\nInteroperability is about two or more blockchains interacting to move assets and data back and forth. This is usually achieved by two-way mechanisms called bridges.\nInteroperating chains can be in a symmetric or asymmetric relationship. Two main chains that interoperate (Ethereum and Cardano, for instance) form the symmetric case. A mainchain and a sidechain that interoperate form the asymmetric case.\nIn the symmetric case, if one chain dies, the other one is not affected. The situation is different with the asymmetric case, because the sidechain depends on the mainchain, but not the other way around. If the sidechain dies or is compromised, a firewall property typically protects the mainchain from harm. However, if the mainchain is compromised, the sidechain will usually no longer be able to function securely. However, the precise consequences depend on the nature of the sidechain's dependency on the mainchain.\nThe main blockchain and its properties (like throughput and scaling) represent layer 1. Sidechains and off-chain solutions (like ZK-rollups) that run independently alongside the main blockchain are referred to as layer 2 solutions.\nSidechains give two immediate advantages to a network:\nEasy addition of new features; and\nScalability\nNew features\nThe addition of sidechains enables blockchain developers to add new features to a network without introducing additional security risks. These added features open up the possibility for developers building on top of the network to explore new use cases.\nAlso, sidechains can inherit some (or all) features (ledger model, consensus mechanism, etc.) from their parent chain, and pair them with features that might not exist on the main chain. For example, a sidechain can combine different security models, consensus protocols, or governance models to create a brand-new blockchain that can interoperate with other blockchain networks.\nThe EVM sidechain is a Cardano sidechain -which is currently underway- this sidechain will enable Solidity DApps and EVM developers to build on the Cardano platform. In this way, developers can easily expand their community's reach into Cardano and benefit from the blockchain's existing capabilities.\nScalability\nSidechains enable a high degree of versatility and scalability. A blockchain can spin up a series of sidechains and 'delegate' processing work to them to increase throughput, for example. Think of this as a manager delegating tasks to other staff so that more work can be done simultaneously.\nSidechains do have one drawback: in most cases, they're not operated by the same nodes or network as the mainchain, which means that sidechain nodes will need to trust the sidechain's security model. The EVM sidechain however will implement a sidechain that will inherit Cardano s security model.\nHydra is a layer 2 solution for Cardano. It is not a single protocol, but rather a family of layer 2 protocols designed to address network security and scalability capabilities. As part of the Basho development phase, Hydra focuses on steady network optimizations and improvements to establish a scalable, versatile, and high-throughput blockchain. The Hydra suite of protocols includes the Hydra Head protocol, Interhead Hydra, Hydra Tail, etc.\nThe Hydra Head protocol is the first in this suite and an important element of Cardano s scaling journey. It provides the foundation on which to build out advanced scalability solutions and will be the first element to be delivered while research on the others is completed.\nHydra Heads are isomorphic multi-party state channels and form fast and secure off-chain communication paths between two or more participants to process transactions. Being isomorphic means that this channel works just the same way as the mainchain, but is faster and cheaper to operate due to its local scope. It is very similar to Bitcoin Lightning, but elegantly extends the mainchain with fully capable EUTXO mini-ledgers to layer more complex solutions on top. Use cases of the basic Hydra Head include bank-to-bank private transfers for processing multiple transactions between 2 or more peers, a pay-per-use API service to pay a virtual private cloud provider for resources, an auction between a seller and several bidders, etc.\nThis technology can also produce advanced layer 2 solutions, including networks of Hydra Heads that would support fast and cheap consumer-to-consumer payments, or Interhead Hydra, which could introduce seamless smart contract scalability.\nMithril is a research and engineering effort carried out by IOG to boost the efficiency and speed of data synchronization, state bootstrapping, and trust issues in blockchain applications. As part of the Basho development phase, Mithril is now in development to be applied as a protocol on Cardano.\nData synchronization and state bootstrapping are integral to ensuring the accuracy of operations on the blockchain. For certain messages or actions, it is important that a particular number of stakeholders provide their cryptographic signatures.\nFor the base case, we go from a linear number of participants (without Mithril) to a logarithmic one (with Mithril), which is more efficient. This means that the higher the number of participants who need to agree on operations, the more complex it becomes to efficiently aggregate their signatures. In a base scenario, to presume a signature that talks for the majority of stakeholders, every stakeholder needs to sign the appropriate individual message. This results in delays in terms of scalability and speed.\nMithril has been designed to address these issues and to ensure efficient data and state synchronization while preserving rigorous security settings. Simply put, Mithril allows a variety of applications to work faster on the blockchain. Mithril's aggregation does not require signers to coordinate with other signers to produce signatures: they can sign independently and anyone can perform the aggregation, even at a later time. The signature scheme also lets different stakeholders validate only a given checkpoint of the chain (where 'checkpoint' is a state of the chain at some point in time, plus Mithril proofs to support that) without going through the whole transaction history of the given state. This results in fast-chain state bootstrapping,\nOverall, the protocol is also beneficial for light client applications like light wallets that need to work fast without a full chain synchronization. Mithril signatures can be also useful for lightweight tally verification, or cryptocurrency governance decision-making. When applied to full-node clients like Daedalus, Mithril can boost full-node data synchronization ensuring speed and decreasing resource consumption.\nSince the Alonzo hard fork in September 2021, Cardano offers a blockchain environment to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The DApp Store currently under development will be a gateway to the Cardano DApp ecosystem.\nFor developers, the DApp Store will provide a path to building product awareness and driving user adoption, plus a way to establish their DApps' legitimacy and build reputation.\nFor end users, the dAppStore will be an on-ramp, the main touch point to a wide range of blockchain products, and a path to the discovery of new use cases and capabilities offered by DApps. The DApp Store will provide frictionless access to the ecosystem through an easy-to-use interface. End users will be equipped with all the information about DApp offerings, including the security assurance level of certified DApps, and usage statistics to help them make the right choices.\nHard forks tend to be 'traumatic' events where a blockchain splits ('forks'), rendering the 'old' blockchain invalid, along with its transaction history, protocol, etc.\nThe hard fork combinator is an IOG-engineered, open-source technology that, rather than discarding the old data, combines two protocols into a single protocol. We call this a sequential combination of the two protocols because it runs the first protocol for a while and at some point, it switches over to the second. The current Cardano chain combines blocks of the following development phases: Byron, Shelley, Allegra, Mary, and Alonzo. After future transitions, it will also combine Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire blocks - all as a single property.\nWe have successfully used this technology for all the hard forks that Cardano has undergone (except for the first one, where Cardano switched from Ouroboros Classic to Ouroboros BFT.)\nCardano is written in Haskell, a functional language that emphasizes 'pure' functions. That is, functions that produce the same result for the same input.\nHaskell is particularly well suited to Cardano's high-assurance code, and the need for greater formal verification in the blockchain. Cardano aims to become a global social and financial system, which requires a very high degree of reliability and verification.\nMany other companies use Haskell, both because of its security properties and pure functional nature. Well-known firms like Oracle and Facebook use Haskell for blockchain research and advertising, respectively, while lesser-known companies such as Atos IT and Jotron use it for building applications for the aerospace industry.\nPlutus is Cardano's native smart contract language. Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs.\nPlutus draws from modern language research to provide a safe, full-stack programming environment based on Haskell, the leading purely-functional programming language. By using Plutus, users can be confident in the correct execution of their smart contracts.\nWatch the latest Plutus update video.\nMarlowe is a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing and executing financial contracts.\nMarlowe contracts are optimized for financial transactions, development platforms, and ensure a fast track for financial service providers to build expertise in smart contracts and blockchain technology.\nMarlowe provides a suite of products for the community that will foster the adoption of Cardano in finance. Marlowe creates a blockchain-specific way to replicate key processes within financial services by making smart contract development easier for developers in this industry.\nMarlowe also aims to facilitate new possibilities of financial innovation and aims to become the technology powering a host of smart contract based-financial services.\nCardano and Bitcoin bear some fundamental differences in terms of design, purpose, and usability.\nCardano uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while Bitcoin relies on proof of work to mine new coins and add blocks to the chain. Functionally, Bitcoin is designed to transfer digital currency in a decentralized, peer-to-peer fashion. Cardano, on the other hand, supports a much broader range of functions. Cardano can handle smart contracts, custom tokens, and decentralized applications (DApps).\nAnother key difference between Cardano and Bitcoin is energy utilization. Bitcoin's proof-of-work design consumes huge amounts of energy, to the tune of 204.50 terawatt-hours. Cardano is far more environmentally sustainable. Charles Hoskinson estimates that Cardano s electricity consumption is about 0.01 of Bitcoin s.\nCardano differs from Ethereum in fundamental ways.\nCardano is designed as a proof-of-stake blockchain. The transformation of the Ethereum chain from proof of work to proof of stake was the main motivation for ETH2.0 and the Merge.\nCardano and Ethereum feature different staking systems. Cardano users delegate their ada to stake pools run by SPOs, while Ethereum does not natively support delegation.\nEthereum users can either run their own validating node, stake through a third-party operator as a service, or stake through pooled staking. Solo home staking on Ethereum requires a minimum of 32 ETH and a dedicated computer connected to the internet 24/7 while staking as a service and pooled staking also have their own constraints. Ethereum penalizes a validator that acts against the network through slashing.\nOn Cardano, Ouroboros provides incentives for good behavior instead. Each SPO pledges funds to its pool to make it more attractive and earn a higher percentage of rewards. Dishonest behavior will result in loss of rewards. Leading-edge game theory techniques have contributed to this strategy too.\nFinally, staking on Cardano is more convenient than on Ethereum as there is no locking (users can withdraw ada at any time), there is no minimum stake requirement, rewards get automatically assigned, and the custody always remains with an ada holder.\nFor more details on staking see this comparison and an infographic.\nAlso, Cardano supports custom tokens natively, without the need for smart contracts. Ethereum does support custom tokens also, but requires smart contracts, which adds a layer of complexity and the possibility of errors. In Cardano, the ledger handles all token functionality.\nAnother fundamental difference is the accounting model. Cardano features an extended unspent transaction output (EUTXO) model. Ethereum uses an account-based ledger model. This is significant for many reasons. For example, Cardano's model enables simpler transaction verification as each individual UTXO can only be consumed once, and as whole. Ethereum's transaction logic is more complex, as each individual transaction updates the global state of the chain. Because Ethereum s transactions are processed sequentially, parallelization is hard to implement, to the detriment of throughput.\nCardano's EUTXO accounting model is deterministic, meaning transactions can be validated beforehand. Fees and transaction outcomes are predictable. Also, if a transaction fails the phase 1 validation, no fees are taken. This is not the case in an account-based model, like Ethereum, where users will lose all paid fees in this same scenario.\nCardano and Polkadot share a common starting point: the resolution of some of the shortcomings inherent to Ethereum's design, including chronic network congestion, high gas fees, unpredictable transaction outcomes, etc.\nThe chains' evolutionary paths diverged, however, as both chains differ in substantive ways, starting with their consensus mechanisms. Cardano uses proof of stake, whereas Polkadot relies on a variation of this system, called Nominated Proof of Stake, which is designed with the roles of validators and nominators to maximize chain security. Validators produce new blocks, validate parachain blocks, and guarantee finality. Nominators can choose to back select validators with their stake. Nominators can approve candidates that they trust and back them with their tokens. Polkadot s design was in fact heavily influenced by Cardano.\nAnother fundamental difference is in the chains' architecture. Cardano's design includes three layers (consensus, ledger, and network), whereas Polkadot's architecture is anchored on a single layer, the Relay Chain.\nThere are some similarities between Cardano and Solana, and the media often refers to both chains as direct rivals . Both chains use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, for example, but Solana adds a technology known as proof of history, where consensus is achieved by the validation of the time difference between two events on the blockchain. Proof of history enables timestamps to be built on the blockchain itself (rather than relying on off-chain programs to calculate time, like Ethereum does). Proof-of-history technology is achieved through a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF).\nBut in stark contrast to Cardano, the Solana blockchain is not as decentralized. It has been reported that almost 50 of all Solana's tokens are owned by venture capital entities, the blockchain's developers, and the Solana Labs company. Also, the Solana Foundation is currently the only entity able to add new blocks to the chain.\nAnother well-known trait of the Solana blockchain is the costly hardware requirements needed for running a validator node. Cardano's nodes can be run efficiently with far lower hardware specs.\nCardano offers liquid staking without slashing, so there is no risk for delegators to lose funds. In contrast, the Solana delegation system does involve slashing, so delegators can lose funds.\nCardano's strength and resilience lie in peer-reviewed research and design principles.\nCardano and Algorand have some similarities.\nBoth are backed by strong academic research (Algorand was founded by an MIT professor and Turing award winner), and both emphasize decentralization as a core tenet.\nCardano and Algorand operate proof-of-stake consensus protocols, which means significantly better energy efficiency and faster transaction times than proof-of-work chains like Ethereum or Bitcoin. But each chain uses a different implementation of the consensus mechanism. Algorand implements what it calls Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS), which randomly selects a token holder as the next block producer. The block then needs to be approved by 1,000 validators before being added to the chain. Cardano uses Ouroboros, the first provably secure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\nCardano is written in Haskell (with Plutus as its scripting language), while Algorand uses JavaScript, Python, Java, and Go.\nBoth chains also differ in their core architecture: Algorand features two layers, whereas Cardano uses three.\nIn terms of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Algorand users can create NFTs using a system built into the protocol, without the need for smart contracts. Cardano users can create NFTs in a variety of ways.\nAda (from 19th-century English writer and mathematician Ada Lovelace) is Cardano's native digital currency. It is the sole means to pay for transactions on the Cardano blockchain. Formal ledger rules determine the effects of these ledger transactions, yielding an immutable and independently verifiable record that tracks the movement of ada and other assets over time. Transactions are authorized using secure cryptographic keys that are owned by the ada holder.\nAs described below, ada holders can opt to stake their ada holding in order to participate in the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which determines how transactions are included in successive Cardano blocks. They receive rewards for this in proportion to the stake that has been delegated. In addition, ada allows holders to:\nparticipate in governance activities, including voting on Catalyst ecosystem proposals\npay for the costs of creating and transferring assets such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\npay for the costs of using smart contracts\npay for the costs of recording data on the blockchain\ntransfer ada tokens to other users\n1 ada is divided into 1,000,000 lovelace.\nAs a fully decentralized blockchain, a large network of Cardano stake pools creates 100 of the blocks. These pools gather the ada that has been delegated ('staked') by ada holders, earning rewards that are based on the blocks that the pool contributes to the chain.\nEvery 5 days (a Cardano epoch), Ouroboros chooses certain pools to add blocks to the chain, in proportion to the ada that is held by each pool. At the end of the epoch, block creation rewards are given to the pools that have been selected and that have successfully created their assigned blocks. These rewards are distributed among those ada holders who staked their ada as well as the pool operator, and contribute to the pool's maintenance, growth, and sustainability.\nSince the chance of a stake pool being selected for block creation increases based upon the amount of ada delegated to it, it's important for the pool to attract as many delegators as possible, up to the point when the pool becomes 'saturated'. When the pool is saturated, it has reached the peak return on investment (ROI) for its delegators. Any more ada delegated to a saturated pool will dilute the rewards for other delegators, reducing the ROI. The saturation property is designed to avoid a single pool dominating block creation, encouraging staked ada to be distributed among many stakes, non-saturated pools.\nRealFi\nIdentity stands at the center of everything a blockchain can do. Blockchain identity solutions enable participants to build bonds and access essential services.\nCardano integrates decentralized identity to open up a brand new range of opportunities and inclusivity that confluence in RealFi Real finance targeted at the people who really need new ways to access finance, creating that real value often missing from DeFi.\nRealFi is an ecosystem of products that remove the frictions between real-world economic activities to offer greater access and cheaper credit/financial products for real people.\nDaedalus is a full-node hierarchical deterministic (HD) desktop wallet for ada.\nDaedalus comes bundled with a full Cardano node, so requires a relatively high-specification desktop machine for good performance. The wallet stores the entire history of the Cardano blockchain and validates all blocks and transactions for fully trustless and autonomous operation. Daedalus is ideal for those who want accurate blockchain data, but should not be the go-to wallet for everyday, minor transactions.\nYoroi is a light wallet for ada running as a browser extension. It connects to a full Cardano node hosted by a third party (Emurgo).\nYoroi allows for instant initial setup, plus quick and easy operation with the minimum usage of system resources. It is also available as a mobile application.\nDaedalus supports a range of hardware wallets to keep ada secure.\nLedger Nano X\nLedger Nano S\nTrezor model T\nCardano boasts of a thriving and very active developer community that has developed a number of compatible wallets. These include:\nNami\nEternl\nFlint\nGero\nExodus\nAdaLite\nTyphon\nNuFi\nOne of the key pillars for Cardano's viability is active community engagement and participation. This necessitates an effective governance mechanism. Using an iterative, anti-fragile approach and setting high standards for effective decision-making, IOG provides the Cardano community with the mechanisms and human processes required to help decide & build the future of Cardano.\nIOG plans to deliver this through absolute Liquid democracy - collective decision-making through direct participation and dynamic representation.\nLiquid democracy is a concept of a hybrid governance system that stands somewhere between representative and direct democracy. Ada holders can choose to vote directly, or delegate their votes to domain experts called Delegate Representatives (dReps_)_. This democratic culture plays a key role in Cardano's long-term sustainability as a public blockchain system.\nLiquid democracy is also about the staking benefits. Cardano s delegation mechanism is based on a liquid democracy, meaning that staked ada are never locked and can be utilized at any time. Other platforms use a third-party protocol to make staked tokens liquid, which has the potential to introduce security problems.\nProject Catalyst is a program that allows ada holders to directly vote on and allocate funds from the Cardano Treasury to start-up projects building applications, tools, and products for Cardano.\nCatalyst brings governance to Cardano by allowing the community to self-determine priorities for growth.\nTo do this, Project Catalyst is divided into a series of funds, which are deployed approximately every twelve weeks. These funds are used to elicit ideas in the form of proposals from participants. Each proposal is focused on a challenge issued by the Project Catalyst team or the Project Catalyst community. The proposals then go through a community refinement process where they are vetted for feasibility, auditability, and impact by a group of incentivized community advisors. Once the proposals have been finalized, they are voted on by the community, and ada funds are distributed to the successful projects.\nCatalyst enables people to realize great ideas and implement them, but funding is only part of the journey toward success. Other factors, such as education, mentorship, collaborations, and product roadmap development are also needed to nurture projects and help them formalize a business plan and effective go-to-market strategy.\nThe Catalyst Circle is a human sensor array acting as the representative body for all the different groups participating in Project Catalyst. The Circle monitors the current state and future plans regarding governance in Catalyst. It detects and discusses concerns, objections, and opportunities arising within the Catalyst ecosystem. The Circle might discuss, for example, the definition of amounts allocated to challenges Fund over Fund; changes or conditions to incentive parameters; the Catalyst API, etc.\nBy recording meetings and capturing actions in a backlog accessible to all, this activity provides a view into the hopes, wants, needs, and concerns of the community within Project Catalyst. The Circle is also responsible for determining its own future shape and defining the election processes for Circle v3.\nThe Circle exists to fulfill four key goals:\nTo facilitate communication between the different functional groups\nTo provide a heads-up when red lines are crossed within a certain group\nTo suggest improvements on plans and processes that shape Project Catalyst\nTo define the election process for upcoming Circles\nThere are also numerous examples of community-led governance initiatives in addition to Catalyst. One significant example is the Cardano DeFi Alliance. The Cardano DeFi Alliance is a consortium of projects with the primary mission of standardizing Plutus and Cardano best practices within the Cardano ecosystem. It aims to drive composability across Cardano DeFi protocols. The DeFi Alliance offers a framework to Plutus protocol development teams who are focused on collaboration of key issues and their strategic development.\nCardano s ecosystem also encourages broad community participation. The Cardano improvements proposals program ( CIP ) allows ada holders and other third parties to build applications on the Cardano blockchain. The CIP describes standards and processes and provides general guidelines and information to the Cardano community. It is a formal, technical communication process that exists off-chain.\nIdentity is key to accessing a range of private and public services. From opening a bank account to obtaining loans or a driver's license, access to education, etc., the need to prove to others who we are is almost omnipresent in everyday life.\nAtala PRISM is IOG s decentralized identity solution. It enables people to own their personal data and interact with organizations seamlessly, privately, and securely. Visit the Atala PRISM website for more information.\nA stake pool is a network node holding the combined ada ('stake') of several delegators. Stake pools yield rewards to those ada holders who choose to delegate their ada to them. Stake pools are used to ensure that everyone can participate in the Cardano Blockchain, regardless of technical experience or availability to keep a node running. These stake pools focus on maintenance and hold the combined stake of various stakeholders in a single entity. Stake pools are responsible for processing transactions that will be placed in the ledger, as well as producing new blocks.\nStake pools can be public or private. Any Cardano user can delegate ada to public pools. Private stake pools, however, only deliver rewards to their owners.\nVisit this page for more information about stake pools.\nEducation is central to the Cardano mission. That s why IOG, the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo and other Cadano participants are all committed to upskilling developers to build on the Cardano blockchain.\nThrough this education outreach, members of the Cardano community gain the essential skills they need to build on Cardano. An empowered community means a stronger ecosystem.\nIn 2021, IOG launched the Plutus Pioneer and Atala Pioneer programs. Together, these programs saw over 3,500 participants trained on Plutus and Atala and were very well received by the community. A Marlowe Pioneer Program will launch in mid-2022.\nEarlier in 2022, IOG launched the IOG Academy, a library of educational videos and materials covering Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe.\nIOG also recently established a partnership with the European Business University of Luxembourg (EBU), with the goal of making education accessible for everyone in developing countries. EBU has so far rolled out courses on Haskell and Plutus.\nAlso, IOG works with a number of universities worldwide.\nThe implementation of the native tokens feature enabled the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Cardano.\nThe native tokens feature extends the existing accounting infrastructure defined in the ledger model (originally designed for processing ada-only transactions) to accommodate transactions using a range of assets.\nNative support offers distinct advantages for developers: there is no need to create smart contracts to handle custom tokens, for example, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for manual errors since the ledger handles all token-related functionality.\nDue in part to the ease of creation and low minting costs, the NFT space has rapidly grown to be one of the most vibrant and creative elements of the early Cardano ecosystem, with over 400 projects and NFT marketplaces launched and live by early 2022. As of late March 2022, over 4 million NFTs have minted on Cardano.\nThe Cardano non-fungible tokens (CNFT) is a community created- and led- marketplace for NFTs built on Cardano.\nLaunched in 2021 by a multi-national team of NFT creators, the site became the first marketplace for all Cardano NFTs.\nOur technical documentation site covers all topics about Cardano s technology, features, etc.\nFind all the tools and resources you need to build on Cardano.\nChat and interact with fellow Cardano enthusiasts from around the world.\nIOG\nCardano community\nIOG\nCardano community\nDeveloper portal\nIOG s Official Telegram channel\nKeep up to date with all stories about Cardano.\nBrowse our extensive library of published papers.\nWe regularly publish blog posts reflecting updates, new features, and relevant Cardano stories.\nBrowse all Cardano-related terms.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Cardanos Vasil upgrade what to expect?",
    "completion": "Author: Tim Harrison - VP Community & Ecosystem\nLast updated: 16th September 2022\nSummary:\nIncreased functionality, performance & scalability; find out what the Vasil upgrade will bring to Cardano.\nArticle:\nWe re now a little under one week away from the deployment of the Vasil upgrade, which significantly improves and enhances Cardano's capabilities. New Plutus v2 features and enhancements will enable DApp developers to create novel and exciting experiences, while diffusion pipelining unlocks the potential for greater throughput and network capacity.\nVasil preparations have been underway for some time across the entire Cardano ecosystem. The core engineering teams at IOG and the Cardano Foundation, SPOs, DApp developers, and exchanges have performed intensive testing and integration efforts, with positive results. A joint IOG/Cardano Foundation team will use the hard fork combinator to deploy Vasil at the protocol level on September 22nd. The new capabilities (including node and CLI support for reference inputs, inline datums, reference scripts, and collateral outputs), along with a new Plutus cost model, will become available for developers to utilize on mainnet exactly one epoch later, on September 27th.\nIt's been a journey both methodical and exciting. Cardano's development evolved in a series of defined stages ('eras'). First, a foundation of security and correctness. Capability, scalability, and expressiveness next. The Byron federated era, and the Byron reboot which rebuilt the core platform closed with the Shelley upgrade in the summer of 2020. Shelley transformed Cardano into the most decentralized proof-of-stake platform in the world, with almost 3,000 active stake pools.\n2021's Mary upgrade introduced NFTs and multi-asset capability, sparking the creation of one of the most vibrant NFT communities in the blockchain space with over 6 million distinct native tokens issued to date.\nThe Alonzo upgrade in the fall of 2021 implemented smart contract capability using the Plutus scripting language, establishing an ecosystem that now sees well over 1,000 projects building on Cardano.\nVasil enhances Cardano's smart contract capabilities through Plutus v2, which adds greater efficiency to an already powerful smart contract platform. Vasil leverages the EUTXO model to enable faster and more sophisticated DApps.\nThis upgrade has been an ambitious and collaborative effort from its inception. The community has requested and in fact advanced many of the enhancements via the Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) process. This further demonstrates the vibrancy and ongoing growth of the developer community building on Cardano.\nThe main additions that Vasil unlocks are:\nReference inputs (CIP-31). This upgrade enables data sharing on-chain. Previously, datums were carried in transaction outputs; they stored and provided access to information on the blockchain. However, to access information in this datum, it was necessary to spend the output that the datum was attached to. This required the re-creation of a spent output. The addition of reference inputs now allows developers to look at the datum without extra steps. This facilitates access to information stored on the blockchain without the need for spending and re-creating UTXOs. This will be useful for oracles, for example.\nInline datums (CIP-32). Transaction datums were previously attached to outputs as hashes. With the implementation of inline datums, developers can now create scripts and attach datums directly to outputs instead of using their hashes. This simplifies how datums are used a user can see the actual datum rather than supply it to match the given hash.\nReference scripts (CIP-33). In Alonzo, when spending an output locked within a Plutus script, the script had to be included in the spending transaction. This increased the size of the script also causing certain delays in its processing. The reference scripts upgrade allows developers to reference a script without including it in each transaction. This significantly reduces transaction size, improves throughput, and reduces script execution costs (since the script only needs to be paid for once).\nDatums and redeemers. Following the Vasil upgrade, developers will be able to see redeemers for all inputs rather than just the one being passed to the currently executing script.\nData Serialisation primitive. A new serialiseData (CIP-42) Plutus primitive reduces the overall memory and CPU costs allowing for more optimized and generic ways of data serialization.\nThe community is eagerly anticipating these updates to Plutus. Several much-awaited new DeFi projects, including Indigo Protocol, Liqwid Finance, and Maladex intend to leverage v2 capabilities when they launch. And many other, currently live projects will upgrade their code to take full advantage of the new capabilities. Such a broad scope of enhancements means that the Cardano ecosystem will see brand new DApps and new improved DApps (after updating and auditing) begin deploying during Q4 and beyond.\nBenefitting from a new, more efficient Plutus interpreter, new Plutus cost models (active on-chain from September 27th) will make both v1 and v2 DApps cheaper. The extent of these advantages will depend on the individual DApp, but early reports from DApp developers are very promising. Artano, an NFT project currently running on Cardano, recently published a blog sharing their findings from extensive testing. When utilizing Plutus v2, they saw a 90 + decrease in script size and a corresponding cost reduction of over 75 .\nScript collateral adjustment (CIP-40) improves transaction validation. Previously, the collateral amount was set to 150 of the transaction fee, and no change was provided to the collateral UTXO. This meant that if a script failed phase-2 validation, a DApp user would lose all the funds stored in the UTXO chosen for the collateral.\nAfter Vasil, DApp developers will be able to specify a change address for the script collateral. If the script fails phase-2 validation, only the collateral amount will be taken, and the remaining funds will be sent to the change address.\nIOG applied a series of steady, careful parameter optimizations (such as block size and script memory units increase) throughout early 2022 to tune and improve network performance. As a result, the network is now highly performant with load consistently well within required measures.\nDiffusion pipelining is a further improvement to the consensus layer that facilitates faster block propagation. Also deployed as part of Vasil, it will enable gains in block production headroom, which will enable further increases to Cardano's performance and competitiveness. Script validation processes will further see adjustments and optimizations contributing to consistency in block propagation times and higher transaction processing rates. Diffusion pipelining gives greater scope for further adjustments, by improving block propagation times, thus enabling higher throughput.\nDiffusion pipelining effectively streamlines the process of sharing information about newly created blocks among network participants by ensuring that blocks can be shared (propagated) in the network well within five seconds (the safe security ceiling ) after their creation. Diffusion pipelining propagates blocks before their full validation, thus overlapping the time spent on diffusion with the time needed on validation.\nPipelining also ensures that the block header referencing the hash of a previous block is propagated correctly. The body of the block is retained within the metadata included in the next block, which is essential for DDoS attack resistance even without full block confirmation.\nUltimately, diffusion pipelining will improve scalability by enabling further performance improvements. In layman s terms, it is another lever that can be pulled. And as always, making slow, steady and measured changes is key. We can anticipate a spike in activity immediately following the upgrade as the community test drives the capabilities. Monitoring will continue for at least four epochs post-hard fork, at which point a decision will be made about further adjustments, based on 'normal' network bandwidth.\nIt is also worth noting that while block production has been fully decentralized since March 31st, 2021, the Vasil upgrade will remove the d parameter entirely, thus cementing decentralization in perpetuity and preventing any future re-federation.\nFinally, Vasil optimizes Ouroboros Verifiable Random Function (VRF) process. Before Vasil, block validation required two VRF functions in every network hop. Vasil drops one of these functions, resulting in faster block validation and network syncing times overall. Users will experience higher performance without compromising security settings.\nVasil represents a complex body of work, from several perspectives. First off in terms of core engineering scope, this is the most extensive upgrade the IOG team has attempted to date, touching every layer of the network stack. As a result, every downstream component (including DB-sync, the wallet backend, Rosetta etc.) has required updating and full regression testing.\nAnd there are multiple ecosystem stakeholders to be considered. Ensuring that any upgrade is safe and secure, and that players across the Cardano ecosystem are fully ready has always been paramount. And while IOG has been working to a clear plan, the nature of software engineering along with these dependencies means that things can take longer than anticipated.\nWith this in mind, IOG and the Cardano Foundation, recently agreed on some clear critical mass indicators in the final mile to ensure ecosystem readiness, before announcing the date for the hard fork combinator event. These were:\n75 of mainnet blocks being created by the final Vasil node candidate (1.35.3)\nApproximately 25 exchanges upgraded (representing c.80 of ada liquidity)\nTop 10 DApps by TVL confirming they have upgraded to 1.35.3 on PreProduction and are ready for mainnet.\nTracking against these metrics has been ongoing. The SPO community was the first to tick the box ; 98 of blocks are now being minted by the new 1.35.3 node, significantly exceeding the minimum threshold set. At the time of writing, exchange liquidity is close to 60 t, and with many of the leading exchanges confirmed ready or in the process of upgrading, the team is fully confident in this regard. IOG has been working closely with a number of leading DApp projects to track their readiness and again, the numbers are looking good. A recent poll among the technical community confirmed readiness for 22nd September hence the date for the mainnet upgrade has been agreed.\nA few things need to happen between now and the agreed hard fork date. The Vasil DevNet, which was spun up specifically for early Vasil testing, has now been deprecated. The new Preview environment will become the agile development platform for the community going forward, with the PreProduction environment mirroring mainnet more closely. A successful upgrade on the PreProduction environment is the final stage before hard forking the mainnet.\nHere s a closer look at the technical timelines:\nVasil arrives in the month of Cardano's fifth anniversary, and represents a step-change in the blockchain's capabilities. Yet the regular ada holder using Cardano for transactions and DApps doesn't need to do anything, as it all happens mostly behind the scenes. Cardano s unique Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) technology makes upgrades for end users a seamless and fuss-free affair. All they have to do is look forward to greater efficiency and faster transaction processing times!\nAt the time of writing, approx. exchange liquidity is nearing 60 . While the Cardano Foundation exchange team IOG anticipates this figure will be close to the 80 threshold by the time of the upgrade, users holding their ada on exchanges might experience service disruption if their chosen exchange is yet to update their system at the time of the network upgrade. If personal liquidity is important to you, IOG recommends tracking the exchanges that have upgraded or consulting exchange customer support pages.\nThe upgrade was named in honor of Cardano ambassador, the late Vasil St. Dabov, who sadly passed away in 2021. Vasil was a Bulgarian mathematician, programmer, polymath and conservationist who planted over 10,000 trees in his lifetime, and hosted Cardano s 2nd anniversary celebrations in his home city of Plovdiv in 2019.\nSo it is especially poignant and entirely coincidental that September 22nd is also the anniversary of the 1908 declaration of independence of the Bulgarian state (one of the oldest in Europe) from the Ottoman empire. A happy accident for a steadfast and highly deliberate community that imparts additional meaning to this most significant of upgrades.\nStay up to date on the upgrade progress via IOG s Twitter and YouTube. Thanks from all the team at IOG to the Cardano Foundation and the Cardano Community for their continued support.

    "prompt": "6 types of blockchain consensus mechanisms?",
    "completion": "Blockchains are distributed systems in which records of digital transactions are both publicly verifiable and immutable. Each new transaction is included in a block along with other recent transactions, and the block is then added to a chain of other blocks (hence the term blockchain ).\nFor a blockchain to operate successfully, the participants also known as nodes need to agree on the validity of each new block. Blockchains can use different variations of different consensus protocols to determine eligibility of block-producing nodes.\nTo ensure continuity, block producers must reach consensus on a particular transaction history. This is achieved by a specific consensus mechanism that guarantees that the participant s views converge to the same history of events. This ensures trust in the blockchain as a whole, without the need to trust specific participants. Mutually distrustful entities can still participate in the blockchain, comfortable in the knowledge that the blockchain itself can arbitrate and verify their actions.\nDifferent protocols provide varying levels of security, scalability, and decentralization. Each consensus mechanism might claim to be the 'best' solution.\nLet s take a look at six blockchain protocols.\nTwo of the best-known consensus protocols are proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS), but others (and multiple variations on the above) also exist. Let s delve into how some of these mechanisms work and what sets them apart.\nPoW was the first blockchain consensus mechanism with Satoshi Nakamoto applying this model to the Bitcoin chain in 2009.\nPoW relies on competition between computers (miners) to solve moderately hard puzzles. The next miner to find a possible solution to a query gets to mine a new block on the blockchain.\nErgo and Ethereum Classic also use PoW.\nHere are a few advantages and disadvantages to think about before committing to a PoW chain:\nAdvantage\nDisadvantages\nThe high energy consumption used in solving queries (because miners are all actively competing to mine a block) is a major disadvantage of PoW chains.\nExpensive and specialized hardware is required to become a miner, thus hindering decentralization.\nPoW has scalability limitations due to the network's design, which limits block size and creation time.\nPoS is a newer, less energy-intensive, and thus more sustainable consensus mechanism than PoW. Through PoS consensus, holders of a blockchain asset can participate in securing and validating on-chain transactions by delegating their stake to a validator.\nLaunched in 2012, Peercoin was the first PoS project. Cardano, Polygon, and Tezos are three popular PoS blockchains. Ethereum has recently moved from PoW to PoS after a successful Merge .\nIt is important to note that unlike Ethereum s version of PoS, however, Cardano s PoS mechanism:\nEnables liquid staking (i.e. no lock-up) through which holders of Cardano native tokens can withdraw their stake or delegate it to another validator (stake pool) at any time.\nRequires a small initial amount of 2.17 ada to start staking\nHas no slashing feature that risks unfairly punishing delegators for staking to nodes that do not operate as intended.\nOuroboros is Cardano s PoS consensus protocol and was the first provably secure PoS protocol. In other words, Ouroboros offers mathematically verifiable security against attackers. The protocol is guaranteed to be secure, as long as 51 of the stake is held by honest participants. According to Google scholar, the original paper has been academically cited more than 1400 times, and variants of the protocol are used on other PoS chains.\nLet s look at the pros and cons of PoS:\nAdvantages\nValidators don t need expensive specialized equipment to set up nodes, a standard computer will do thus encouraging decentralization.\nPoS protocols are highly energy-efficient & sustainable because validators do not need to solve resource-intensive puzzles.\nDisadvantages\nValidators on some PoS consensus mechanisms must lock up a small amount of their assets (pledge), which can t be unstaked for a set period.\nNote: This doesn t apply to Cardano.\nValidators with the largest amounts of staked assets or multiple pools have significant influence in validating transactions, which could pose security risks.\nWith some chains, delegators and validators can risk losing part of their staked funds (slashing) if validators validate inaccurate transactions, go offline along with other validators, or attack the network.\nNote: There is no such slashing on Cardano.\nPoS systems with a small number of active validators or those that overly rely on centrally hosted Cloud services (vs bare metal, self-hosted nodes) reduce decentralization.\nDPoS is a modified PoS consensus mechanism that implements a voting system with two actors: delegates and voters.\nVoters stake their assets and elect delegates to validate transactions on the network. This means that a delegate s ability to become and remain a validator depends on their reputation. One mistake and they can be removed and replaced. Maintaining their reputation, therefore, becomes crucial.\nWAX and EOS are DPoS blockchains.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of a DPoS consensus mechanism include:\nAdvantages\nTransactions are fast on a DPoS network due to the limited number of validators, enabling faster consensus.\nA DPoS consensus protocol blockchain remains secure through voting. Any delegate that behaves suspiciously can be voted out instantly.\nA DPoS blockchain is very energy efficient.\nDisadvantages\nDPoS networks may be more susceptible to a 51 attack due to the relatively small number of validators. This attack occurs when over 50 of the chain s stake is controlled by one individual or group.\nDPoS blockchains are more centralized than chains with some of the other consensus mechanisms because of fewer validators on a DPoS chain.\nVoters with more staked assets are more influential.\nPoA is a consensus model that might better suit private networks. Instead of staking the chain s digital assets, a committee is entrusted to perform validation in contrast to public (i.e., permissionless) participation.\nThe PoA consensus mechanism determines a fixed set of nodes to perform chain maintenance. These nodes earn the exclusive right to secure the network and validate transactions.\nVeChain and private networks such as JP Morgan s Coin Systems use this mechanism.\nA PoA protocol has the following pros and cons:\nAdvantage\nDisadvantages\nThe blockchain is maintained by a small number of approved validators, meaning it is not truly decentralized.\nBecoming a validator requires a lot of fiat, making it harder for most people to participate in the process.\nPoC also known as proof of space requires miners to have available disk space to obtain mining rights and validate transactions. Similarly to PoW, in PoC, the rights to produce a new block are assigned proportionally to the space (instead of computational power) a given miner dedicates to the PoC system.\nBlockchains using PoC include Chia, Signum (formerly known as Burstcoin), SpaceMint, and Storj.\nAdvantages\nBlock mining does not require high energy consumption as block producer election depends on available disk space.\nAny standard hard disk is compatible with PoC.\nThe drive can be used for any other data storage purpose after mining data has been removed, unlike in PoW mechanisms where hardware is only used to mine.\nNodes do not require hard drive upgrades or specialized hardware, they only require disk space.\nDisadvantage\nThe blockchain industry is still relatively new, having existed for not much longer than a decade. Organizations and blockchain projects continuously look into how to build and improve on consensus mechanisms.\nInput Output Global is one such example with its recent research into Ofelimos a novel proof of useful work (PoUW) consensus mechanism that seeks to minimize the energy wastage in a PoW mechanism.\nAt the time of writing, no blockchain uses PoUW and any pros and cons of this consensus mechanism are only theoretical. Here's a possible advantage and a presumed disadvantage of Ofelimos:\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nLearn more about this new model by reading this in-depth article.\n_ _\n6\nPoW PoS 2\nProof of work PoW\nPoW 2009\nPoW\nErgo Ethereum Classic PoW\nPoW\n_ _ PoW\nPoW\nProof of stake PoS\nPoS PoW PoS\n2012 Peercoin PoS Cardano Polygon Tezos PoS PoW PoS\nCardano PoS\nCardano\n2.17ADA\nOuroboros Cardano PoS PoS Ouroboros _ _ 51 Google scholar 1400 PoS\nPoS\nPoS\nCardano\nCardano\nDelegated proof of stake DPoS\nDPoS PoS 2\n1\nWAX EOS DPoS\nDPoS\nDPoS\nDPoS\nDPoS\nDPoS 51 50 1 1\nDPoS\nProof of authority PoA\nPoA\nPoA\nVeChain JP Morgan Coin Systems\nPoA\nProof of capacity PoC\nPoC PoW PoC PoC\nPoC Chia Signum Burstcoin SpaceMint Storj\nPoC\nPoW\nProof of useful work PoUW\n10\nInput Output Global Ofelimos _ _ PoUW PoW\nPoUW Ofelimos\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20250117?",
    "completion": "Over the past few weeks, the ledger team focused on polishing Conway ledger features in preparation for this month s Plomin hard fork and continued testing to increase confidence in this transition. As part of this effort, the team discovered and resolved several bugs. All stake pool operators (SPOs) are encouraged to upgrade to Cardano node v.10.1.4, which includes all these fixes.\nThe team also addressed technical debt by removing crypto parameterization from every era definition in the ledger, simplifying the codebase, and enabling a switch to a newer GHC compiler version that addresses a known performance regression. Another major change involved updating how UTXO serialization occurs within the ledger state, mitigating missed blocks due to garbage collection during ledger snapshot creation, and providing a substantial performance boost for UTXO-HD.\nAdditionally, the team released and integrated an updated cryptographic library that had been undergoing revisions for the past few years. They also finalized work on defining CDDL specifications in Haskell now fully generated for every era improving confidence in correctness through additional type checking and reducing duplication and complexity by eliminating manual serialization definitions.\nWALLETS AND SERVICES\nThe Lace team released Lace v.1.18.2, which includes the following updates and improvements:\nCrash recovery. Enhanced recovery methods have been implemented to reduce wallet crashes.\nCIP-95 signData bug fix. Interactions are now smoother for decentralized applications (DApps) using the signData method.\nsignData\nsignData\nBlockfrost migration. Progress continues toward making Blockfrost the primary wallet data provider.\nPerformance boost. There are improvements in account bootstrapping and application startup, resulting in faster performance and reduced resource demands.\nThis week, the Mithril team activated the certification of the Cardano stake distribution for the mainnet and upgraded all Mithril networks to Cardano node v.10.1.4. They also continued implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database. They completed the artifacts creation and synchronization engine, completed the digests route for the incremental Cardano database in the aggregator REST API, and started working on the cloud synchronization of the artifacts.\nFinally, they enhanced the golden tests implementations of the messages, worked on the split of the mithril-common crate, and investigated a bug in the client on Windows Power Shell.\nOuroboros Leios is another research and development project that the IO teams are working on. Leios aims to increase Cardano s throughput by optimizing available network resources and enabling faster transaction processing and confirmation.\nLast week, the Leios team focused on enhancing the Rust simulation and updating the cost dashboard. They added a basic simulation for CPU usage and latency, configured nodes with four simulated cores, and incorporated lottery won events to track CPU processing. The team worked on the DeltaQ workstream, updating it with new MIN/MAX combinators for best- and worst-case results. Cost dashboard improvements include updated CPU costs, revised input/output operations per second values, and adjustments to the endorser block rate.\nAdditionally, the team benchmarked BLS signatures, provided CPU time estimates, and continued refining technical report sections on BLS and MUSEN certificates.\nFinally, they progressed with sortition analysis for input and endorser blocks, contributing findings to the draft of the technical report.\nVoting is currently in progress for the approval of the Plomin hard fork, which is the second hard fork in the Chang upgrade. The constitution sets three thresholds for approval:\nBlock-producing nodes: 85 must be operating the required Cardano node (v.10.1.4).\nSPOs: 51 approval required.\nInterim constitutional committee: 66.7 approval required.\nAll SPOs are encouraged to vote, even if they choose to abstain. If they take no action, their vote will count as NO . However, if they abstain, that vote will be excluded from the total required for approval.\nFor more details, please refer to the latest Plomin hard fork bulletin.\nThe governance action for the Plomin hard fork will expire on January 24 (end of epoch 535).\nProject Catalyst town halls are on break until January 22, when the Fund13 retrospective session is scheduled. In the meantime, onboarding for Fund13 winners is progressing steadily. Currently, 93 of onboarding forms have been completed, 85 of milestone statements have been submitted, and 45 of those have already been approved. The technical development of the Catalyst stack is also moving forward. Furthermore, the first primary funding distribution for 2025 is expected to take place this week, as Catalyst resumes its regular cadence for the new year.\nThis week, the education team is planning for the next Haskell course and updating the Cardano Developer course to incorporate recent Aiken development updates. They are also outlining their plans for Midnight education.\nPlomin Conway SPO Cardano v.10.1.4\nGHC 1 UTXO UTXO-HD\nHaskell CDDL\nLace Lace v.1.18.2\nCIP-95 signData signData DApp\nBlockfrost Blockfrost\nMithril Cardano Mithril Cardano v.10.1.4 Cardano REST API Cardano\nmithril-common Windows Power Shell\nOuroboros Leios IO 1 Leios Cardano\nLeios Rust CPU 4 CPU DeltaQ MIN/MAX CPU 1\nBLS CPU BLS MUSEN\nChang 2 Plomin 3\n85 Cardano v.10.1.4\nSPO 51\n66.7\nSPO\nPlomin\nPlomin 1 24 535\nProject Catalyst Fund13 1 22 Fund13 93 85 45 Catalyst Catalyst 2025\nHaskell Aiken Cardano Midnight\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20250110?",
    "completion": "This week, the core technology teams released Cardano node v.10.1.4, which ensures the network is ready for the upcoming Plomin hard fork. This release includes mempool safeguards designed to block specific types of problematic transactions, further enhancing the reliability and security of the network.\nThe consensus team worked on the augmentation of headers with time, simplifying time management within the consensus process. Additionally, the team resolved a mempool issue that was too stringent in rejecting certain large transactions. They also overhauled the block-fetch logic for bulk synchronization mode, significantly improving synchronization performance.\nFurthermore, the team released the necessary consensus packages for Cardano node v.10.2, which include the following versions:\nouroboros-consensus-protocol-0.10.0.0\nouroboros-consensus-protocol-0.10.0.0\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-diffusion-0.19.0.0\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-diffusion-0.19.0.0\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-cardano-0.21.0.0\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-cardano-0.21.0.0\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-0.22.0.0.\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-0.22.0.0\nThe Plutus Core team is finalizing the data-backed ScriptContext API (versions V1, V2, and V3). This update is expected to significantly enhance the performance of many scripts written in Plinth (formerly Plutus Tx). For more details, please refer to the relevant section in the user guide.\nScriptContext\nThis week, the Hydra team focused on finalizing the main portion of their work on incremental commits, now seeking feedback from the community on this feature. They also made progress on the `hydra-explorer` by adding support for multiple versions and also advanced their custom ledger experiment. Additionally, they upgraded Docusaurus, updated the dependencies for the cardano-api, and made various cleanups and debugging improvements.\ncardano-api\nThe next steps for the team include completing work on the incremental commits, finalizing multi-version support for the hydra-explorer, concluding the custom ledger experiment, planning the v.0.20.0 release, and providing ongoing support for the Hydra Doom tournament.\nhydra-explorer\nThe Mithril team released the new distribution 2450.0, which offers stable support for Cardano node v.10.1.3 and includes bug fixes and performance improvements.\nThe team also continued implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database. They kept working on creating and synchronizing the artifacts, implemented the artifact routes, and started working on the digest route for the incremental Cardano database in the aggregator REST API.\nFinally, they completed the experimental cache for certificate verification in the WASM client, implemented enhancements to the CI, and fixed a bug with identifier collisions in the incremental Cardano database artifacts.\nChanges to Cardano governance are now controlled by community actions. The governance action for the Cardano Plomin hard fork is the trigger that enables the second and final step in the Chang upgrade. It was submitted to mainnet at the end of epoch 529, on December 20, 2024 at 21:44 UTC, as recommended by the hard fork working group, including representatives from IO. Voting on this governance action is underway with input from stake pool operators and the interim constitutional committee.\nThis week in Catalyst, the team is gradually returning to routine after the holiday period. The onboarding process for the Fund13 winners is progressing well, with 70 of the onboarding forms submitted, over 50 of the statements of milestones (SOMs) completed, and nearly 10 of SOMs already signed off.\nThe upcoming steps in the onboarding process will involve due diligence and test transactions, which will take place in the coming days and weeks. Town halls are currently on break and are scheduled to resume in the next couple of weeks with Fund13 retrospective town halls.\nAdditionally, the focus on replacing IdeaScale with a native solution to enhance the community experience remains a top priority as technical development continues.\nThe education team is developing strategies and plans for courses and events throughout the year while analyzing feedback from the community survey shared in December.\nCardano v.10.1.4 Plomin\nCardano v.10.2\nouroboros-consensus-protocol-0.10.0.0\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-diffusion-0.19.0.0\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-Cardano-0.21.0.0\nrelease-ouroboros-consensus-0.22.0.0\nPlutus Core ScriptContext API V1 V2 V3 Plinth Plutus Tx\nHydra hydra-explorer Docusaurus cardano-api\nhydra-explorer v.0.20.0 Hydra Doom\nMithril 2450.0 Cardano v.10.1.3\nCardano REST API Cardano\nWASM CI Cardano\nCardano Cardano Plomin Chang 2 529 2024 12 21 06:44\nCatalyst Fund13 70 SOM 50 SOM 10\nFund13\nIdeaScale\n12\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Six reasons why EUTXO wins?",
    "completion": "Cardano features some of the most innovative elements of blockchain technology: Hydra and Mithril, for example layer 2 solutions designed to enhance scalability. Or Cardano s proof-of-stake consensus protocol, Ouroboros, whose various 'flavors' (Genesis, Praos, Peras, etc) ensure that the blockchain remains efficient and secure even under adversarial conditions.\nBut there's one particular element that sets Cardano apart from contemporaneous chains the extended unspent transaction output (EUTXO) accounting model. Introduced during the Alonzo upgrade in September 2021, EUTXO combines the relative semantic simplicity of the 'basic' UTXO pioneered by Bitcoin with enhanced expressiveness through smart contracts. This combination enables Cardano to achieve certain things that blockchains using account-based models simply cannot match due to constraints in their design. 'UTXO-based programmability enables functionalities and use cases not feasible on account-based ledgers. For example, multi-threaded order book trading engines, horizontal scaling via state channels layer 2s, and efficient ZKP interoperability and oracle solutions,' says Marvin Bertin, CEO at Maestro, a blockchain infrastructure provider tailored for UTXO chains.\nHere s an analogy to help illustrate the difference in the models. Think of the UTXO model (like Bitcoin or Cardano) as managing money with a jar of individual coins. Each coin in your jar represents a specific value. When you want to spend, you pick the right coins to cover that amount. So if you re paying $8, for example, and you have coins worth $5, $3, and $1, you could choose the $5 and $3 coins to cover it. If you go over, you get change back in smaller denomination coins, which goes back into your jar as new coins. So, your total balance is just the sum of all the coins in your jar, each tracked separately.\nOn the other hand, the account-based model is more like a regular bank account. Here, you don t worry about individual coins; you just have a single balance. It s one number that goes up or down. If you have $50 in your account and spend $8, your balance just drops to $42. There s no need to match specific coins or worry about change it s all just one total.\nEUTXO differs in many ways from the account-based model, but the two main differences are:\nLocality: Transactions in the EUTXO model depend exclusively on the inputs and outputs consumed and generated by that transaction. In contrast, transactions in the account-based model can be affected by other things going on on the blockchain.\nDeterminism: Transactions in the EUTXO model are fully deterministic. That means we know what a transaction is going to do before submission, and nothing can change it. In contrast, transactions in the account-based model can yield unexpected results.\nSo why do these differences matter? What does EUTXO do for Cardano, and why do we think it s better than the account-based model?\n1. Predictable transactions\nUsers know precisely what the transaction will do on the blockchain before submitting it. This is a fantastic property for both smart contract developers and end users because everyone can submit transactions without fear of being charged for a failed transaction or resulting in unexpected outcomes on the blockchain (ie loss of funds). This means that the outcome of a successful transaction is always exactly what the user expects and consented to via their signature. As long as a transaction succeeds, its outcome cannot be affected by any other transactions on the network, and if the transaction fails, no fees are paid, says Anastasia Labs Philip DiSarro. An added benefit of this property is that Cardano is not subject to issues arising from Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and so-called 'sandwich attacks', something that it's all too common in account-based chains.\nThe worst that can happen is that two users try to consume the same input simultaneously. In that case, the second transaction would have a different effect than the one described (it wouldn't consume one of the specified inputs because it's not there anymore), so it'd be instantly rejected without any cost, and the user can try again with a different input.\n2. Predictable transaction costs and resource usage\nEUTXO's deterministic design represents a marked advantage over other accounting models since transaction fees for a valid transaction can be accurately calculated. That means end users will know exactly how much the transaction will cost before submitting it to the blockchain. This is in stark contrast with other chains, where transaction fees can change quite dramatically before the transaction is posted. The same applies to resource (CPU time and memory, for example) usage, which can be predicted prior to executing the transaction.\n3. Concurrency and scalability\nIf we have many transactions that consume different inputs (which is the case most of the time), we know thanks to the locality property they won't affect each other. That means we can process all of them simultaneously, greatly enhancing throughput and scalability. Parallel processing is especially useful for high-demand DApps like decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which need to handle many transactions quickly. Besides the big boost we get from being able to process transactions concurrently, locality and determinism allow for scalability solutions like Hydra that can't be implemented on account-based systems.\n4. Improved security\nDeterminism and locality properties of EUTXO greatly reduce the number of all possible attack vectors and make it a lot easier for developers to reason about what is happening. That means that it is much easier to ensure the security of smart contracts in Cardano than their counterparts in account-based models. It is very difficult to reason about the correctness of protocols on the account-based model due to the complexity of global state. It also means it's easier to prove the correctness of smart contracts, which is highly appreciated in the context of managing valuable assets.\n5. Improved flexibility\nThe EUTXO model is more flexible than the account-based model. To illustrate this, you could simulate the account model with EUTXO and vice versa. This greater flexibility allows DApp developers to create new architectures and ways of doing things that can't be achieved using the account-based model.\nThe sheer composability of EUTXO style DApps means no DApp is an island - they can be synergistically composed to create possibilities TradFi only dreams about, says @__fallen_icarus, who s currently building a P2P DeFi wallet for Cardano. EUTXO model DeFi is more than the sum of its parts. But to achieve this, DApps and wallets need to be specifically designed for the EUTXO model - no more copying account model DApps and wallets! The P2P-DeFi Wallet and the P2P-DeFi Protocols are a first attempt at bringing these fantasies to life.\nIO Education s Robertino Martinez adds: for example, DEX users can sign dozens of transactions consuming different UTXOs accepting different trades, and an off-chain algorithm can mix and match them to optimize for any metric the user cares about. Providing dozens (or hundreds, for that matter) of signed transactions bears no risk for the end user because the transactions will always produce the desired result, or the chain will reject them. However, it has the powerful advantage that they can all be executed automatically at optimal times, even if submitting them all simultaneously at 3 am is the best option. This procedure can't be done in account-based blockchains since their transactions aren't fully deterministic, and submitting one transaction could invalidate all others.\n6. Best choice for zero-knowledge proofs\nThe EUTXO model is perfect for zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), as they allow you to perform complex, high-intensity computation off-chain and produce a proof of that computation verifiable on-chain. For instance, you could execute a smart contract off-chain and then provide a proof that the smart contract was executed in a given state. This proof can be verified on the network. Importantly, to utilize this method of zero-knowledge scaling, to construct the proof you need to know in advance the state against which you are executing the computation. Due to EUTXO s transaction predictability, this is trivial, since the only input required to evaluate the computation is the transaction itself.\nIn contrast, because transactions on account-based models operate on the global state, while constructing transactions you do not have knowledge of the relevant state required to construct the proof. Also, you don t know what the state of the smart contract will look like by the time the transaction is processed because other transactions that are processed in the block can impact that state. So for instance, if you create a proof that a smart contract was executed on a given state, when you submit that proof to the network, the proof will likely be invalidated since by the time your transaction is processed the state (that you used to construct the ZKP) would have already changed due to other transactions.\nEUTXO s unique approach of tracking individual coins allows for more precise control, predictability, and parallel processing. This design not only boosts security but also supports complex, multi-party transactions with a high degree of reliability and flexibility. Ultimately, each model has its strengths, but we believe EUTXO is particularly well suited for the demands of decentralized applications and multi-asset support. It s a deliberate design decision that we believe is one of Cardano s many superpowers.\nThanks to Dr Lars Brunjes, Robertino Martinez, Marvin Bertin, Fallen Icarus, and Philip DiSarro for their contributions to this piece.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20241213?",
    "completion": "Dear community, this report marks the final development update for 2024. Regular updates will resume on January 10, 2025.\nWishing everyone happy holidays and a wonderful New Year ! Here s to a year ahead filled with exciting progress, new milestones, and shared success.\nOver the past few weeks, the networking team collaborated with the Cardano Foundation on measuring network performance and transaction inclusion times. Although the network load has increased since early November, the majority of transactions are still included within two blocks of submission, indicating the network remains largely uncongested. Only 59 out of approximately 3,700 test transactions took more than two blocks for inclusion, which means that 98.4 of test transactions were processed within the two-block limit (with a maximum wait time of five blocks (201 seconds)).\nDuring the recent network working group meeting (NWG), the team addressed strategies for running hot standby block-producing nodes using peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. A short-term solution involves implementing initiator-only connections for local roots, enabling stake pool operators (SPOs) to have hidden hot standby nodes that still receive blocks but do not propagate them until needed. This change is outlined in this issue and 5021 and 5017 pull requests. Once this functionality is in place, the non-P2P code can be removed. Long-term, there are plans to allow controlling block propagation of self-produced blocks via cardano-cli.\ncardano-cli\nIn addition, work continued on making ouroboros-network reusable for both cardano-node and mithril. The new block-fetch client for Genesis was merged, offering improved logic and design as described here.\nouroboros-network\ncardano-node\nmithril\nThe consensus team reviewed a `lsm-trees**`** milestone presentation from Well-Typed, showcasing progress in two key areas: snapshot support for persisting ledger snapshots and table union for storing more ledger state parts on disk. The team also completed the UTXO-HD code review. Before merging, they plan to run additional system-level benchmarks to understand the performance impact.\nAdditionally, they submitted a request to the technical steering committee regarding how the node should handle low apparent participation and added support for computing and verifying cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) of ledger state snapshots, increasing robustness when loading data from disk.\nThis week, the Daedalus team released v.7.0.2 for mainnet, pre-production, and preview networks.This release enables users to delegate their voting power to delegated representatives (DReps) or choose an automatic voting option (abstain or no confidence), ensuring that the Daedalus community has a straightforward way to make their voices heard in the future governance of Cardano.\nIn the new voting tab, users can select their registration preference for each wallet held in Daedalus.\nExisting users will get a prompt to update via the Daedalus newsfeed. If you are new to Daedalus and would like to download this new release, download it only from the official site. For more details, see the release notes.\nThis week, the Plutus team opened a CIP to add modules to Untyped Plutus Core. This CIP proposes a solution to Cardano s script size limitations by enabling the use of modular code through reference inputs, allowing scripts to share and reuse code across multiple transactions. While the core implementation avoids changes to existing components, higher-performance variations requiring CEK machine updates will need to balance implementation costs and benchmarking.\nThis week, the Hydra team focused on finalizing outstanding work before the holiday season. The team remains dedicated to finishing work on incremental commits, advancing multiple-version support for hydra-explorer, and supporting the Hydra Doom tournament.\nhydra-explorer\nThis week, the Mithril team continued to implement the incremental certification of the Cardano database. They kept working on creating and synchronizing the artifacts. The team finished exploring solutions for signer registration in networks with multiple aggregators and updated the About Mithril section of the website. They also progressed with developing a cache for certificate verification in the WASM client.\nFinally, the team accelerated the creation of signer fixtures in the tests and added execution rights to the binaries pre-built in the CI.\nThe Cardano Constitutional Convention was a great success. After two days of debate, the constitution was approved by an overwhelming 95 of delegates.\nThe constitution was officially signed on the third day of the convention, and is now entering the process of ratification by an on-chain vote of the community of ada holders.\nThe second and final stage of the Chang upgrade, the Plomin hard fork, is currently planned for January 2025. After this, Cardano s move to the Voltaire development phase will be complete and Cardano will be fully governed by the community.\nThis week in Catalyst has been exciting, highlighted by town hall 186 and the announcement of another town hall scheduled for next week before the holidays. The voting period, which ends on December 12 at 11 AM UTC, has seen great participation from the community. Congratulations to everyone who helped advance Cardano governance and bring top projects into Catalyst.\nThe Catalyst team appreciates the community's involvement, especially following the successful Pitch Fest that showcased Fund13 proposals during the voting period. Updates from the constitutional convention in Argentina and Nairobi were also shared during town hall 186 and can be rewatched here.\nLooking ahead, the technical development of Catalyst Voices remains a priority. There are plans to phase out Ideascale in the coming months to create a more seamless process.\nThis week, the education team is reflecting on the success of their learning sessions in Buenos Aires at the Constitutional Convention and Cardano Tech Week. For a taste of Tech Week, check out this video.\nThey are also developing a community survey about the education events and courses held in 2024. This survey will be shared on Discord next week, and the results will be analyzed to ensure that they can offer more of what the community loves in 2025.\n2024 2025 1 10\n1\nCardano 11 2 3,700 2 59 98.4 2 5 201\nNWG P2P SPO 5021 5017 P2P Cardano-cli\nouroboros-network cardano-node mithril Genesis\nWell-Typed lsm-trees 2 UTXO-HD\nCRC\nDardalus v.7.0.2\nDRep Cardano Daedalus\nCardano\nDaedalus Daedalus\nPlutus Untyped Plutus Core CIP CIP Cardano CEK\nHydra hydra-explorer Hydra Doom\nMithril Cardano About Mithril WASM\nCI\nCardano 2 95\n3 ADA\nChang Plomin 2025 1 Cardano Voltaire Cardano\nCatalyst 186 12 12 8 Cardano Catalyst\nCatalyst Fund13 Pitch Fest 186\nCatalyst Voices Ideascale\nCardano Tech Week Tech Week\n2024 Discord 2025\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

They released Cardano node v.10.1.3 and DB Sync v.13.6.0.2 and v.13.6.0.4 to all environments, and configured mainnet bootstraps, enabling a shared dashboard.\nThe ledger team discovered and fixed a bug in the ledger that was backported in a patch release of cardano-node-10.1.3. The bug was in protocol version 10 and affected the DRep delegation. While it did not impact the mainnet, the patched version was necessary to ensure correct behavior in protocol version 10.\ncardano-node-10.1.3\nIn addition to this bug fix, the team continued working on testing and addressing the technical debt. They also added a new ledger state query that allows nodes to provide the current DRep voting stake distribution.\nThis week, the Mithril team continued implementing the incremental certification of the Cardano database. They completed the computation of the message to sign and started working on creating and synchronizing the artifacts. The team also continued exploring solutions for signer registration in networks with multiple aggregators and progressed on developing a cache for certificate verification in the WASM client.\nFinally, they implemented a retry mechanism in the end-to-end tests within the CI to address flakiness and investigated methods to track the origin of client requests.\nThis week, the spotlight is on the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Nairobi, Kenya. Many people from Input | Output are attending to support the elected delegates in deliberations and votes to ratify a new Cardano constitution.\nThe Cardano constitution is the cornerstone that will guide and anchor all the other processes and developments Cardano will need to provide a sustainable technological platform for Web3 products and services.\nThe voting phase for Project Catalyst Fund13 is currently underway and will continue until December 12. So far, over 1.5bn ada in voting power has been recorded. During the week of December 2-6, the Catalyst Pitch Fest events showcased proposal videos from various submission categories through live streams on X (@catalyst_onX) to encourage community support.\nAdditionally, the technical development of Voices is progressing steadily. Instead of the usual town hall meeting, this week will focus on the Pitch Fest and the global Constitutional Convention taking place in Argentina and Kenya, with an emphasis on encouraging voter engagement. Remember to cast your votes by December 12.\nThis week, members of the education team are on the ground in Buenos Aires for the Constitutional Convention, delivering a mix of theoretical and practical sessions, including Cardano Days tracks available in Spanish and English, and live node demonstrations using a new SPO mobile learning laboratory.\nAdditionally, the team supported the Cardano Tech Week community event last week, which featured a mix of theoretical and practical sessions, including a hackathon by CardanoSolar, a talk on extended UTXO, game theory by Dr. Lars Br njes, a session focused on partner chains, and Cardano Days tracks in Spanish and English.\nSRE Cardano Cardano v.10.1.3 DB Sync v.13.6.0.2 v.13.6.0.4\ncardano-node-10.1.3 10 DRep 10\nDRep\nMithril Cardano WASM\nCI\nInput | Output Cardano\nCardano Web3 Cardano\nProject Catalyst Fund13 12 12 15 ADA 12 2 6 Catalyst Pitch Fest X @catalys_onX\nVoices Pitch Fest 12 12\nCardano Days SPO\nCardano Tech Week CardanoSolar UTXO Lars Br njes Cardano Days\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "New Cardano cryptographic primitives will bring greater interoperability and secure, crosschain DApp development?",
    "completion": "Cryptography ensures trust and security in blockchain settings and different blockchains use different cryptographic signature methods. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr signatures are two popular signature schemes used in blockchain platforms. Bitcoin and Ethereum, among other cryptographic systems, use ECDSA. Schnorr signatures, originally proposed as an alternative to ECDSA, are also used in several blockchain networks, such as Polkadot.\nCardano uses the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) with elliptic curve Curve25519 as its base curve (aka. Ed25519). This gives fast signature verification and small signature sizes, which helps to improve the overall performance and security of the blockchain. Additionally, Ed25519 is designed to be resistant to certain types of cryptographic attacks, making it a more secure choice. Monero, Ripple, and others also use Ed25519 as their signature algorithm.\nThe variance in algorithms means that Plutus DApp developers who want to work with other blockchains and need to validate ECDSA and Schnorr signatures would have to spend time, effort, and funds to implement such algorithms over the Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SECP) elliptic curves in Plutus. This considerably increases potential security risks and may use an unrealistic amount of resources.\nSince only Cardano s primary signature algorithm Ed25519 is provided as a Plutus built-in function, ECDSA and Schnorr operations would be more expensive and time-consuming unless also provided as built-in functions.\nTo make it easier for developers to build cross-chain applications, Input Output Global (IOG) has added new built-in functions to Plutus to support ECDSA and Schnorr signatures. This will allow developers to use a wider range of multi-signature or threshold signature designs natively in Cardano, thus providing the highest level of security.\nPreparations have been underway for some time across the entire Cardano ecosystem. The core engineering teams at IOG and the Cardano Foundation, SPOs, DApp developers, and exchanges have performed intensive integration testing in the preview test environment since November 2022, with positive results. This technology is now close to being deployed on the Cardano mainnet.\nFor the Vasil upgrade, IOG and the Cardano Foundation agreed on some clear critical mass indicators in the final mile to ensure ecosystem readiness. The new upgrade is not as complex as Vasil, for example, nor does it have such an impact across existing DApps. Nonetheless, the teams are ensuring readiness by working closely with key Cardano stakeholders (notably SPOs, DApps, and exchanges) that may need to prepare for the new capability.\nAt the time of writing, over 80 of block-producing nodes were running the required new node (version 1.35.4). Downstream components (such as DB Sync, the wallet backend, GraphQL, etc.) are not impacted directly by the change, but as ever, compatibility against the new node version has been fully tested.\nExchanges have already been notified of the upgrade, so they have enough time to upgrade their systems as required. IOG has also polled the DApp/tool development community very few projects will be impacted by the change and we have factored in the needs of those that do need to update their code accordingly. Based on that community polling, the mainnet upgrade is proposed tentatively for February 14, 2023 at 21:44:51 UTC. The mainnet hard fork will take place at the beginning of epoch 394 around absolute slot height 84844800, estimated block height 8403208.\nOn that basis, IOG is targeting the update to the pre-production test environment on February 11, 2023 at 00:00:00 UTC.\nAs ever, stay close to our and the Cardano Foundation social channels for the latest on progress as we head towards this date.

    "prompt": "What IOG has delivered for Cardano?",
    "completion": "This paper has been written by Fernando Sanchez and Olga Hryniuk with input from all IOG teams.\nSince Cardano s first iteration as a federated network of just seven nodes, Input Output Global Inc. (IOG) has added many new pieces to the blockchain design, one at a time. Over five development phases, IOG introduced innovations, new functionality, and novel features, with each phase building upon the previous phase's achievements.\nEvery addition has improved or enhanced Cardano in one way or another. Some features, like smart contracts, are highly visible. Others, such as pipelining or block diffusion, are more subtle but no less impactful. And each new feature brings Cardano one step closer to becoming a leading, robust, and reliable enterprise-grade blockchain.\nToday, Cardano is a third generation, open source, proof-of-stake blockchain platform. Its name derives from Gerolamo Cardano, a mid-16th century Italian physician and mathematician. Third generation blockchain platforms are designed to resolve the issues that the first two generations (Bitcoin and Ethereum) suffer from, including scalability and interoperability, while fulfilling an ambitious agenda of decentralization.\nBut how did IOG, the blockchain engineering company that designed and built Cardano from the ground up, achieve this?\nThis paper highlights the importance and impact of the research and development driven by IOG since the inception of the Cardano mainnet.\nFor clarity and completeness, the structure of this paper matches Cardano's journey. From the initial, foundational steps taken during Byron in 2017 to the delivery of a self-governed, self-sustained, fully decentralized blockchain during Voltaire in 2022.\nIn keeping with this narrative, this paper includes five chapters:\nByron: the foundation of Cardano\nShelley: decentralizing the blockchain\nGoguen: introducing native tokens and smart contracts\nBasho: scaling Cardano\nVoltaire: self-sustainability and governance\nEach chapter focuses on a single phase, recounting its achievements and defining its bearing and importance on the overarching development journey.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "completion": "Pros and cons of the different approaches to adjusting the k parameter and the minimum pool fee\nA set of parameters is used to define the Cardano protocol's behavior. Some parameters are stable and can be left unchanged more or less indefinitely. Others relate to more dynamic on-chain activities (staking environment or price of ada, to name just two) and consequently may need periodic adjustment due to changes and fluctuations in these factors.\nTwo variable parameters in particular continue to generate debate within the stake pool operator community as changes to either (or both) can have an impact on decentralization, yields, and other aspects of the Cardano experience. These are the k value, which determines the level at which a pool becomes saturated with stake and so receives no further rewards, and the minimum pool fee, which is a flat amount paid to a pool before rewards are split with delegators.\nEarlier this year, a survey was made within the Cardano SPO community on how these might be adjusted and its results can be seen here.\nThe results showed that many in the SPO community were supportive of making a change to k and the minimum fee, but there remains some contention. While there is a high degree of flexibility in changing the parameters themselves, the decision process is less clear-cut. So it is important to be clear about the requirements for adjusting either parameter. Altering them is fundamentally a community decision but the overriding concern for all should be the overall health and decentralization of the network.\nIn line with transparency and objectivity, this piece first attempts to offer a brief overview of the k parameter and the minimum fees, outlines some of the different ways in which these two parameters could be adjusted, and the pros and cons of each approach.\nThe k parameter determines the maximum stake in a pool that receives awards, in essence creating a soft cap on pool size. This size changes over time and is defined as a percentage of the maximum supply of ada (45bn) minus any amount that remains in the reserve. As of epoch 370, that is 35bn ada.\nMaximum pool size = (45bn - reserves) / k = ( 35bn / 500 ) = 70m\nWithin the Cardano documentation, a pool that reaches its maximum size is said to be saturated. A saturated pool offers the highest rewards to delegators and is most lucrative for its operators, while an over-saturated pool delivers lower rewards. The system thereby incentivizes delegators to move their stake to a pool containing less ada, in order to maintain their yield and thus encourages the decentralization of the network.\nAs of October 2022, the value of k is 500. Previously, IOG had suggested that this value could be safely raised to 1,000, but ultimately any final decision was postponed due to three factors: i) surveying the community did not give a conclusive result; ii) there was an IOG operational focus on delivering Vasil capability; iii) and there was a possibly disruptive effect on ada users delegating to pools near the current saturation level so proper planning and communicating was required.\nWhile k is absolutely not a panacea to more equitable stake distribution, its value does have some positive impact on some pools. It decreases the maximum size of pools, allowing more pools to be in the optimal range for block creation. If this change were to be accompanied by a change in delegation (and ada holder behavior is key here), it has the potential to create a more diverse staking environment. This is what we saw with the previous change from k=150 to the current level of 500; a number of large pools stopped competing for public delegation, allowing that stake to go to other operators.\nThe situation with moving to k=1,000 is less clear-cut. We would expect private pools (such as those run by exchanges, financial companies, or large ada holders) to split their existing stake into smaller pools. Private pools account for about 35 of the total stake in the ecosystem and we estimate this would lead to another 150 stake pools being created. We do not expect any of that delegation to move to public pools since the net ada rewards generated for large private pools are higher.\nFrom IOG s calculations, there are about 100 public pools that would be affected by a move to k=1000, representing around 2bn ada that would need to be redelegated (8 of the supply). To keep their current profitability, these pools would be inclined to split. Stake pool operation is at its core a commodity activity there is only a marginal difference in rewards when staking to different pools that are producing blocks, which is the way the protocol is intended. However, many of these pools have strong name recognition, sometimes via a long-established track record and/or by content creation and high social media activity. Experience with the pool operators may mean these pools are able to keep a large proportion of their delegators in any newly created pool.\nPools in around 10m+ will be able to offer comparable pricing, so the expectation is that these pools will be the major beneficiaries of any change; taking the majority of the delegation that is not retained by the split pools. (Of that 2bn ada, IOG estimates a third to half of it will end up moving around.)\nThe key takeaway here is that while there may be some moderate increase in network diversity through moving k, the impact is projected to be far less pronounced than the previous change.\nIOG has identified three potential scenarios for consideration by the community.\nOption 1: Single, immediate increase of k to 1,000\nOption 2: Gradual increase of k to 1,000 (by a factor of 100 per month, for example)\nOption 3: No change maintain k's current value (500)\nStake pools perform a critical function within the Cardano ecosystem. They produce new blocks and contribute to the decentralization of the network.\nIn return for this, pools are compensated in two ways:\na fixed fee, which is a flat amount taken if any blocks are produced, and\na variable fee, which is a percentage of the total rewards paid to a pool.\nWhile pools are free to set any variable fee they choose, the ledger rules define a minimum fixed fee.\nMinimum fees act as an additional layer of protection against Sybil attacks (an attempt to take over the network by creating large numbers of zero-fee pools). Abolishing or lowering these minimum fees would remove this protective layer and could leave Cardano more open to certain forms of economic attack. IOG analysis of staking behavior and redelegation suggests that this concern may be a more theoretical issue now, rather than a practical one. Cardano has passed the point where enough delegation is moving around to execute an effective attack in a period less than several years.\nOn the other hand, setting a fixed minimum fee makes it difficult for small pools starting out to compete economically with larger, established pools until they reach a certain size. This fee needs to be met before a pool can start returning rewards to delegators and can add up to an effective rate that can be several times larger than the more visible percentage rate that pools advertise. Delegating to a smaller pool is generally a much worse outcome for delegators and the extra burden of costs are paid by the initial delegators to a pool.\nAdditionally, the minimum fee acts as an incentive for a well-established SPO to spin up new pools, since there is a guaranteed income from doing so.\nNone of the options laid out below have a direct impact on ada holders. With the minimum fee lowered, pools will not have to make any immediate changes. In the short term, the ability to offer a competitive return should benefit smaller SPOs looking to attract delegation and retaining control over fees will keep smaller pools viable for longer.\nAs with the k parameter, IOG would like to present three potential choices for consideration by the community.\nOption 1: Set minimum fee to zero\nOption 2: Reduce min fee significantly (to 40 ada, for example)\nOption 3: Leave min fee as is\nConsidering the information above, altering either or both of these parameters requires careful consideration. Although changes are unlikely to make a significant difference to stake distribution, a properly considered change will still move the needle in a positive direction in terms of supporting smaller pools and assisting continuing decentralization of the network.\nAnd altering these parameters alone form just part of a wider conversation to broaden the spread of stake across the SPO ecosystem. Several community-created improvement proposals (including CIP7, CIP23, and CIP50) continue to be under discussion and evaluation alongside this topic.\nThe Cardano network and general environment has changed significantly over the past year. Going forward, parameter optimization will be a key component of any future technical governance model. With this in mind, IOG plans to form a parameters consultative group in collaboration with a small group of SPOs and the Cardano Foundation. This will evolve as needed to meet the new Cardano governance structure.\nA fresh survey outlining the three options for the target number of pools and the minimum pool cost will be distributed to SPOs this week to capture their preferred route forward. The results will be reviewed by the new parameters group. A decision will then be made and communicated, with a timeline for any change that will take into account the operational needs of the SPOs and other network users.\nThe community now has the chance to consider the options laid out here. The survey/form will be shared today with SPOs via email and the SPO Announcements channel.\nThanks to Colin Edwards, Kevin Hammond, Becky Hopwood, Tim Harrison, and Prof. Aggelos Kiayias for their contribution to this blog.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Introducing the Cardano EVM sidechain?",
    "completion": "Cardano is growing. Expanding. The Vasil upgrade will open up even more opportunities for efficient development and usage of various DApps and DeFi products on Cardano.\nSidechains and layer 2 solutions are key to increasing scalability for projects building on Cardano. In this post, we discuss what sidechains are and how they contribute to an ecosystem of interconnected solutions. We also dive deeper into the unique features that make up the EVM sidechain built by Input Output Global, Inc (IOG).\nIn a previous blog post we discussed how bridges, sidechains, and the AGIX ERC20 converter, enhance Cardano's interoperability, defined as a product or system's ability to understand and interact with other products or systems. When a blockchain network is interoperable, user data and assets generated in one network can be moved between other different networks.\nInteroperability is a crucial consideration in decentralized ecosystems. Once users have the tools to reclaim ownership of their data, they will need infrastructure to enable sharing it with others across multiple interconnected networks. A global economy requires that users' tokens are no longer siloed in any single blockchain. Sidechains coupled with bridging protocols are the solutions that facilitate greater freedom of data movement in a decentralized digital economy.\nFigure 1. An example of different types of sidechains\nBlockchains cannot succeed in isolation. No single blockchain will transform the entire digital infrastructure for the better, nor will a single blockchain revolutionize the way we share data, transact, or engage with others virtually. Over time there is a need for dedicated sidechains that enable a more diverse network of developers to join Cardano, and the tools needed to support the development of applications for specific use cases.\nIOG plans to create a family of sidechains that will bring greater scalability, interoperability, and programmability to Cardano. A number of ecosystem contributors are also working on building their own sidechains to add even more capabilities to Cardano.\nAs Cardano evolves to support a multi-chain architecture, developers will be able to leverage the platform in the following ways:\nUse Plutus to create smart contracts and decentralized applications in a high-assurance, resource-efficient environment.\nUse the EVM sidechain to develop and deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts on Cardano (without paying the high gas fees typically found on Ethereum).\nUse the governance features of the EVM sidechain to create decentralized governance applications that optimize on-chain governance and voting experience.\nThe EVM sidechain will be the first sidechain built and released by IOG, with the goal of opening Cardano up to Solidity developers. The EVM sidechain will allow the Solidity developer community to build DApps on a lower-fees and environmentally friendly platform that consumes far less energy than proof-of-work blockchains.\nHow does it work?\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a piece of software developed by Ethereum to help computers run smart contracts. Every full Ethereum node runs an instance of the EVM to define how the machine state will change with every new block added to the chain. Sidechains built using the EVM offer features equivalent to the Ethereum blockchain for processing and executing smart contracts. These EVM sidechains are also capable of implementing new features, like a different consensus protocol or ledger model, while still retaining essential EVM scripting capabilities.\nThe main features of the EVM sidechain are:\nEthereum compatibility:\nHard fork compatibility. The EVM sidechain will retain compatibility with Ethereum hard forks. This is essential to ensure that the EVM sidechain remains interoperable with Ethereum and other tools and applications built on its network.\nDeveloper tool compatibility. Ethereum developer tools are widely used for asset storage, reading the state of the ledger, monitoring analytics, and more. EVM sidechain users will have access to these tools from the Cardano ecosystem. This creates a lower barrier to entry for Solidity developers looking to build on Cardano.\nWeb3.js wallet compatibility. Web3 technology provides users with complete control over their own data. This means no involvement of third-party corporations owning users personal data. Web3 wallets are known for ensuring user anonymity and data protection while interacting with DApps.\nOuroboros consensus protocol\nThe EVM sidechain will replace Ethereum s proof-of-work consensus algorithm with Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerance (OBFT) consensus protocol. OBFT is an implementation of Ouroboros that is able to tolerate Byzantine faults. OBFT offers good transaction processing at full network speed and instant transaction confirmation as well as proof of settlement.\nConsensus is typically dependent on a fixed number of its validators (nodes), and the OBFT protocol does not presume that nodes can be dynamic. The EVM sidechain expands the initial OBFT protocol to allow for a dynamic validator set. Dynamism will come from committee rotation, but the pool size will stay fixed. The Cardano ledger enables the dynamic validator set feature by acting as a single source of truth to help in the selection of block-producing nodes.\nPermissionless approach\nDecentralization is one of the cornerstones of the digital trust economy. The transparency of blockchain technology inhibits fraud. In order to build a truly decentralized network, it is essential to make sure that the network is permissionless. Permissionless blockchains grant everyone the privilege to take part in network activities without dependence on centralized or federated authority. The EVM sidechain will be a permissionless network.\nSecurity\nThe EVM sidechain includes several features to maintain security, including:\nCardano s EVM sidechain is being developed iteratively. As with any other product launch, an iterative approach and performance assessments are necessary to ensure that everything works as intended.\nInitial testnet delivery will set the foundation for the EVM sidechain assessments and testing, followed by a passive and active sidechain launch, culminating in mainchain deployment:\nFigure 2. Stages of the EVM sidechain deployment\nWe ll be talking about the Cardano EVM sidechain in more detail over the coming months.\nCheck out the EVM sidechain demo to see a smart contract deployed on testnet!\nI d like to thank Kathryn Stacy and Dominika Bukowska for their input and support in creating this blog post.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Overview of the research enabling smart contract support on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Author:\nOlga Hryniuk - Technical Writer\nSummary:\nTaking a closer look at Cardano s research, part 2. Here s more on Cardano s innovative EUTXO model and how it facilitates more efficient smart contracts\nArticle:\nOur previous blog post discussed the research underpinning some of the core elements of Cardano, including staking, delegation, and reward sharing. This time, we outline the papers that helped establish a functional smart contract platform for decentralized application (DApp) development enabled by the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) accounting model.\nBitcoin and Ethereum are among the most popular blockchains nowadays. They use two rather different ledger accounting models to track the distribution and ownership of users' funds. These models are Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model and the account-based model, as employed by Ethereum among other blockchains.\nThe UTXO model guarantees security at the core of financial activities. While UTXO s semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed computing environment, it is rather limited in its support for smart contracts. Ethereum chose the account-based model explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts.\nAddressing the question of whether it is possible to have expressive smart contracts while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model, IOG researchers came up with The Extended UTXO Model and Native Custom Tokens in the Extended UTXO Model solutions. Both research papers were published in 2020 and fully describe the EUTXO model implemented on Cardano.\nManuel Chakravarty, Lambda scientist and Plutus architect at Input Output Global, Inc. says:\nThe UTXO ledger model, battle-tested by Bitcoin, remains the gold standard for security and scalability. We created the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model to gain the level of smart contract expressiveness pioneered by Ethereum, while still maintaining UTXO's unrivaled security and scalability. We simply wanted the best of both worlds!\nThe Extended UTXO Model research paper demonstrates the ability of EUTXO to continually maintain the contract state and use the same contract code along the entire sequence of transactions. Another powerful feature of the EUTXO model is that the fees required for a valid transaction can be predicted precisely before posting it. This is a unique feature driven by the deterministic design of the EUTXO model, which is not found in account-based models.\nSmart contracts are the driving force behind deal execution on Cardano. They are self-executing so they don't rely on third parties.\nAt the ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP'19), Manuel Chakravarty discussed functional blockchains and, in particular, presented Plutus as a functional approach to smart contracts:\nMoving fast and breaking things isn t the right way to build a blockchain platform. Broken things can t be fixed easily. Hence, Plutus was built on the solid mathematical foundation of functional programming. It is a programming platform for smart contracts, which includes elements such as Haskell libraries to write smart contracts, a compiler from Haskell to Plutus Core on-chain code, and various tools to assist development.\nMost blockchain programming platforms depend on a custom language, such as Ethereum s Solidity. Plutus has been realized on top of Haskell. The choice of Haskell enabled the IOG research and engineering teams to reuse the existing Haskell infrastructure, libraries, and tools with an established track record for high-assurance software. Haskell facilitates concise and reusable code, while simplifying informal reasoning, testing, and the use of formal methods to achieve the desired level of security. Formal methods, as the most stringent form of reasoning about code correctness, are of special interest to high-value smart contracts and are well supported by the functional programming paradigm.\nIOG research and engineering teams delivered Plutus smart contracts based on such papers as The Extended UTXO Model , Native Custom Tokens in the Extended UTXO Model , Unraveling recursion: compiling an IR with recursion to System F , and System F in Agda, for fun and profit . Together these papers establish Cardano's smart contract-enabled ledger model as well as the on-chain representation of contract code as so-called lambda terms. System F in Agda, for fun and profit includes a rigorous mathematical definition, which was computer-checked with the help of the Agda theorem prover.\nPlutus is now a living, evolving programming platform for smart contracts on Cardano. The IOG education team has also launched the Plutus Pioneer Program to recruit and train developers in Plutus for the Cardano ecosystem. You can find out more about the program here.\nWhile Plutus is a functional smart contract programming language, Marlowe is a web-based platform to build and run low-cost financial smart contracts visually, without needing deep programming knowledge. It opens a range of use cases for non-programmers to execute straightforward and optimized contracts for financial transactions.\nThe first research paper presenting Marlowe, Marlowe: financial contracts on blockchain , was published in 2018. This paper explores the design of a domain-specific language targeted at the execution of financial contracts. It presents an executable semantics of Marlowe in Haskell, an example of Marlowe in practice, and describes the tool that allows users to interact in-browser with simulations of Marlowe contracts.\nLater, in 2020, the IOG research team published a paper on Efficient static analysis of Marlowe contracts , which presents the summary of work on optimizing the static analysis for Marlowe contracts. Marlowe: implementing and analysing financial contracts on blockchain followed to describe the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano and the web-based development and simulation environment of the Marlowe Playground. The paper also shows that Marlowe contracts can be exhaustively analyzed before running them, thus providing strong guarantees to participants in the contract.\nMarlowe is already available for people to try out within the Marlowe Playground a browser-based sandbox environment where you can develop, simulate, and test the process of writing smart contracts. IOG is currently preparing for a Marlowe testnet launch and will use the Marlowe Pioneers Program to gather feedback and use cases across the Marlowe suite of products. The team has recently delivered the Marlowe CLI tool to enable users to submit transactions and interact with Marlowe contracts using a command line interface. When launched on mainnet, Marlowe contracts will open up a range of DeFi capabilities.\nNow that we have discussed the characteristics of Cardano s EUTXO model and how it facilitates smart contract development on Cardano, we will further discuss the research that enabled multi-asset support. Stay tuned for the next blog post!\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Cardanos foundational research overview?",
    "completion": "Author:\nOlga Hryniuk - Technical Writer\nSummary:\nHere s the first of a series of blog posts taking a closer look at the research underpinning Cardano\nArticle:\nSince its inception in 2015, the Cardano project had one clear goal: to alter the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed. Instead of having a single, authoritative whitepaper, the project combined a range of scientific design principles and engineering best practices to produce a solid, pioneering, research-based blockchain. The key ideas of Cardano development were presented in the 'Why Cardano' essay and the 'Cardano whiteboard' video by Charles Hoskinson. This research-driven approach positions Cardano uniquely among other blockchain platforms.\nA set of the best practices, ideas, and contributions formed Cardano s foundation for building a secure, decentralized, and scalable ledger. There is now a substantial body of research, represented by Input Output Global s extensive library of papers, which at the time of writing numbers 139. Many of them have been peer-reviewed and accepted at top-tier academic conferences. According to Google Scholar, the original Ouroboros paper has been cited more than 1,200 times.\nCharles Hoskinson, IOG CEO, said:\nDecentralization imposes major technical challenges to financial systems worldwide and IOG Research is interested in every single one of them.\nThe vision of IOG Research is to be a leading institution in the academic study of blockchain infrastructures and fintech, and, more broadly, distributed systems secured by cryptographic techniques and incentivized through economic game theory. IOG has established its reputation for tackling difficult research questions in general, and for building formal and reliable foundations for the fintech blockchain infrastructure industry in particular.\nIn this blog post, we take a look at some of the research papers that set the foundations of Cardano.\nThe initial paper to drive the project's research was Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol , which was academically peer-reviewed and published at Crypto 2017.\nConsensus lies at the heart of blockchain networks. Ouroboros is the proof-of-stake consensus protocol for Cardano. The name Ouroboros comes from an ancient symbol that represents eternity and endless return. For Cardano, Ouroboros symbolizes the theoretical eternity of a blockchain.\nSince 2017, a number of Ouroboros protocol versions have been produced. Each flavor of Ouroboros adds different features and functionality to support Cardano s evolution. Starting with Ouroboros Classic, the ledger has undergone regular upgrades. Ouroboros Classic established the foundation for an energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus protocol in a federated setting (Cardano s Byron development theme). Praos, Genesis, and Chronos were designed to ensure enhanced security in a fully permissionless setting. While Genesis improved the Praos protocol, Chronos will make Genesis even more robust when implemented. This blog post describes the evolution of Ouroboros in more detail.\nCoupled with unique technology and mathematically verified mechanisms, Ouroboros realizes a Nakamoto-style consensus adapted for proof of stake. Ouroboros provides the security and robustness guarantees as we know them from Bitcoin s proof-of-work consensus while ensuring greater efficiency in terms of energy consumption. Rather than relying on miners to solve computationally complex problems to create a block, proof-of-stake participants create and validate blocks based on the stake they control in the network.\nIn his blog post, The Ouroboros path to decentralization, Professor Aggelos Kiayias, Chief Scientist at IOG and the chair in cybersecurity and privacy at the University of Edinburgh, says:\nOuroboros is a decentralized ledger protocol that is analyzed in the context of both Byzantine and rational behavior. What makes the protocol unique is the combination of such design elements as stake, dynamic availability, trustless setting, and a reward-sharing incentive scheme.\nTransitioning from a federated setting to full decentralization required some adjustments to the protocol. It was essential to provide the means for proper account management (to enable a stake delegation technique) and incentivized participation.\nThe paper Account Management in Proof of Stake Ledgers published in 2020 explores ways to maximize stakeholders' participation in network maintenance activities.\nTypically, proof-of-stake blockchains depend by nature on the active participation of stakeholders. Stakeholders need to be constantly online to validate network transactions and produce new blocks. However, not every stakeholder has the ability or desire to constantly be online. To ensure that the system is robust and remains secure in such conditions, it is important to enable different types of stakeholder participation.\nStake delegation addresses this problem and allows a user to participate in network activities by delegating their stake to other participants. Stake delegation gives rise to stake pools server nodes holding the staking rights of multiple stakeholders. The paper mathematically analyzes and defines the delegation technique and also implements core wallet properties to process secure payments.\nThe paper Reward Sharing Schemes for Stake Pools , also published in 2020, introduces mechanisms to incentivize stakeholders for their activities.\nThe power of a stake pool comes from the accumulation of stake that is delegated to it. To avoid monopolization of network validation activities by one single pool, it is essential that network participants are incentivized to delegate to a large set of different pools.\nThe reward-sharing scheme describes a means to properly incentivize stake pool operators (SPOs) and delegators for their activities such as transaction validation, block creation, etc. The research shows that the proposed reward mechanism steers the network to a desired level of decentralization and, in particular, offers protection against Sybil attacks. This is enabled by a so-called pledging mechanism, which greatly disincentives the formation of multiple stake pools controlled by a single real-world entity.\nCardano s incentive model established an ecosystem where rational participants benefit from following the protocol, thereby enabling the secure and efficient operation of the Cardano blockchain. The result is a reliably operating, decentralized ledger secured by cryptographic techniques and game-theoretic reward mechanisms.\nStay tuned! In our next posts, we ll take a closer look at some of the research papers that established the foundation for a functional smart-contract platform. Specifically, we ll start with the research that enabled an extended UTxO model, explain what that actually means and how it enables the ledger to handle multi-assets and fees with a variety of benefits for users.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "The 11 blockchain tenets towards a blockchain bill of rights?",
    "completion": "Author: Prof Aggelos Kiayias\nFirst published on October 11, 2024, on iohk.io\n-----\nDesigning blockchain systems is a challenging endeavor. It is also a continuous process, as these systems are long-lived and aim to capture requirements that evolve during their lifetime. It follows that a blockchain project s community often faces difficult decisions that fork the future of a blockchain system in different ways, with consequences that are hard to fully anticipate. Community decision-making frequently requires assessing highly technical proposals that can be mutually conflicting and impactful in various ways.\nTo meet the above challenges for any blockchain project and its community, it can be useful to follow a first principles approach that evaluates whether a specific improvement proposal aligns well with a handful of general principles (or tenets) that are widely accepted by the community and reflect the basic rights the community members expect to enjoy as users and contributors to the system. This methodology provides a common ground and frame of thinking that the community can use to deliberate, categorize, and prioritize different improvement proposals based on how well they align with their fundamental expectations from the system.\nTo showcase this way of thinking, discussed herein are 11 tenets that aim to offer a comprehensive cover of how blockchain systems are supposed to operate and engage with their users and contributors. These tenets are meant to capture the natural desiderata of these systems and the rights of their users. Note that they are not expressed in a way that makes them necessarily mutually compatible or algorithmically enforceable this is inevitably so, as it can also happen in constitutional and human rights law where experts have to weigh between different and sometimes incompatible rights and their appropriate interpretation to find the best possible balance on a case-by-case basis. It can be expected that no realizable system can offer a perfect embodiment of all 11 tenets simultaneously. Ultimately, it is up to the community to decide at a specific point in time what is the most appropriate tradeoff and interpretation in the context of a given improvement proposal.\nWe list the 11 tenets next. Each tenet is followed by a short explanation.\nTenet one (T1) - Transactions cannot be slowed down or censored and will be expediently served for their intended purpose. The parallel that can be made here is to freedom of speech. In this sense, transactions express the ways the users wish to engage with the system, so users should be free and able to do so in a manner proportional to their intent. This excludes censorship but also mandates expediency in processing.\nT2 - The cost of a transaction should be predictable and cannot be unreasonable. While it is expected that the system will impose costs to post a transaction, such costs cannot be unreasonable given the purpose of the transactions, and the costs should be predictable, enabling the users to plan for long-term system use.\nT3 - No one should be prevented from developing and deploying their application as they intended it. The system and its development environment and ecosystem should support users with different backgrounds and skill sets to launch applications that truly capture their intent and offer access to the functionalities and features needed by these applications to operate properly.\nT4 - Everyone s inputs and contributions to the system will be recognized, recorded, processed and assessed fairly. While the system inevitably requires the expenditure of resources to support all its operations, the value that different system contributors offer in terms of maintenance, development, or transaction processing time should be fairly accounted for, so eg it can be rewarded as necessary and in an appropriate manner. Similarly transactions should be fairly processed without allowing some users asymmetric influence in the way their inputs are treated.\nT5 - The value and data users contribute and/or create will not be locked or processed without their consent. A useful parallel here is the right to data portability in the context of the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation. Users should be allowed to transfer their private data to any system or platform they desire to engage with. In the case of a blockchain system, the same should apply to the assets the users possess or create. Similarly, it is critical that the system operates with the users consent and full understanding of the actions it takes regarding how it processes users assets and data.\nT6 - The system will safely preserve the value and information stored in it. Safety here can be interpreted in two ways: (i) integrity of the information recorded. For example, anticipating the possibility of quantum attacks that can potentially violate the security of user keys, it should be ensured that these can be mitigated. (ii) value preservation. For example, anticipating a volatile market, users have the option to use mechanisms such as stablecoins to preserve the value of their assets.\nT7 - No resources will be unnecessarily spent. One should understand this as a resource minimization objective. That is, finding the best algorithm for the given task is important for this tenet. We do not want the system to waste more resources than necessary for a given task.\nT8 - The system will treat users fairly and will evolve according to their collective will aiming at its long term sustainability and viability. This tenet refers to the right of the users and contributors to the system to participate in its governance and development in a fair and representative manner.\nT9 - Users privacy, both in terms of their actions and their data, should be preserved. This tenet is also best understood in parallel to the privacy requirements present in relevant data protection laws, e.g., the EU s General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ). A useful parallel in this context is the data minimization principle that asks for the minimum disclosure of information needed to accomplish a certain objective that the user has consented to.\nT10 - The system will offer users ways to engage that do not require them to break local laws and regulations. Given that blockchain systems are global in nature, it is expected that they span many jurisdictions that may impose varied and complex regulatory requirements. To accommodate this state of affairs, the users should be offered tools to engage with the system that do not require them to violate laws in the jurisdiction they operate.\nT11 - The system s operation should be transparent, predictable, verifiable, interpretable, and without asymmetries. This tenet mandates that the system should operate in a manner that users can observe, verify, predict, and understand. This suggests that system software should be open source and the binaries offered are publicly verifiable. But it also mandates that the services the system offers must accommodate similar levels of transparency and verifiability despite the fact that an individual user cannot completely verify or trust all the actions performed by other participants. Moreover it should not be the case that certain users are at an unfair vantage point and enjoy privileges that others do not have access to.\nThis completes the set of 11 tenets.\nOne way to put the above tenets to use is to assess how a blockchain improvement proposal aligns with them. Given a proposal, assessors may for example ask: if it is implemented, will it improve the system s behavior with respect to some tenets? Moreover, they can ask whether the improvement is tangible and significant, given the resources required to implement it. Furthermore, it could be the case that the improvement proposal will leave the system worse off with respect to some other tenets. In such a case, one can ask whether the tradeoff offered is preferable for the system s future compared to its current state.\nIt can be expected that, on some occasions, such deliberations will not be simple or straightforward, and communities can become polarized around specific proposals along the way. Debate is inevitable and important given the breadth and scope of blockchain systems.\nShould they choose to follow this approach, we anticipate different blockchain communities to interpret and enshrine the above tenets in a way that best reflects their values and objectives. For instance, these tenets are currently being actively debated by the Cardano community as part of a series of constitutional workshops taking place across the globe, prior to the refinement, finalization, and approval of a Cardano constitution text at a constitutional convention in Buenos Aires, Argentina at the end of the year. Hopefully these tenets will act as beacons in the far horizon that will pull Cardano and other blockchain communities to where they intend to travel to, ultimately making it feasible to reach their destination.\nWant to dive deeper into these tenets and join the conversation on Cardano? Join a special X space on Wednesday October 30 at 16:30 UTC with Prof. Aggelos and Charles Hoskinson, hosted by Intersect.

    "prompt": "The Rise and Growth of Mesh?",
    "completion": "Three days ago the team from Gimbalabs released MeshJS v1.7, Chang-ready on mainnet. Its main features:\nChang Cost models\nPlutusV3\nGeneral transaction structure changes to fit Conway\nEmbedded datum\ndRep in Browser Wallet\nNew experimental utxo selection\nAdd verbose to transaction\nHowever, MeshJS v2.0 is on its way. It will come in 3 different flavors:\n100 pure TypeScript: Great for all developers to get Cardano on their frontends.\nWebAssembly: Ideal for developers who want to use Cardano on their TypeScript backends.\nRust: Perfect for applications that require high performance.\nAll 3 versions consist of the same endpoints for wallet, transactions, and various utilities needed. It includes all existing endpoints for anyone to get started with Cardano as easily as possible. It also includes all the low-level transaction-building endpoints for all Conway features, PlutusV3, parameterized scripts, Sidechain (service layer) support, and more.\nTypeScript\nThanks to Input Output (IOHK) JS SDK and Strica libraries, we are able to provide a 100 pure TypeScript implementation of MeshJS. With this TypeScript version, developers can easily integrate Cardano into their frontend applications. New developers can get started with Cardano easily, as we work with various parties to provide educational materials and tutorials.\nWebAssembly\nThe current version is dependent on CSL, but we will be moving to another WASM implementation by SIDAN Lab, Whisky, which wraps the CSL and provides some additional features. This WebAssembly version is for developers who want to use Cardano on their TypeScript backends. It comes with a few additional features for Aiken s UPLC and other performance optimizations.\nRust\nThis Rust version is for backend applications that require high performance (such as DEX and minting/airdrops vending machines). It is built on top of CSL. Here, we provide high-level APIs and utilities for developers for their applications. We also have all the required test cases to ensure everything upstream is working as expected.\nStay tuned for more updates on Mesh v2.0!\nFollow MeshJS.\n---\nAre you new to Cardano?

    "prompt": "Stake Pool Fees What are the 340 ada fee and the percentage fee? Will I be charged this fee to stake my ada?",
    "completion": "You are not charged this fee to stake your ada. The only fees you are charged to stake your ada are:\nA transaction fee (currently around 0.17 ada) to authorize the delegation transaction. 2 ada deposit which you can claim back if you decide to stop staking.\nFor each 5-day epoch, rewards are distributed to all ada holders who delegate to a stake pool, providing the stake pool produced a block. These rewards consist of:\nA set percentage of the ada reserves (undistributed ada). As this is a set percentage this is gradually declining over time. All of the transaction fees during the epoch. Currently, this is a small addition to the reward pot but as Cardano sees more activity this will increase the staking annual percentage rate (APR).\nThe amount of ada received by a pool of delegators from the reserves for each new block is currently around 500 ada. If a stake pool produces 1 block it will receive around 500 ada, 2 blocks around 1000 ada, and so on. The number of blocks a stake pool produces is proportional to the amount of delegation in the Stake Pool. From the total amount of ada that a pool of delegators is awarded, the stake pool operator (SPO) first takes the fixed fee of 340 ada, or maybe more if they have set a higher fixed fee. The SPO is then also awarded the margin fee that they have set, this is a percentage of the ada that remains after the fixed fee is taken. The ada that is left after these fees are taken is then shared between all of the delegators in the stake pool, weighted towards how much ada they have delegated. All of this happens automatically by the protocol, and is therefore trustless.\nThe lowest fees that an SPO can currently set for their stake pool is a 340 fixed fee and a 0 margin fee.\nYou may also find these FAQs of interest:\nIs my ada safe when staking?\nWhat happens when I move to a new stake pool? Will I lose rewards?\nShould I get a hardware wallet?\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

It provides easy-to-use, higher-level APIs and complete backend services that enable developers to build and deploy enterprise and Web3 DApp solutions using Marlowe, but without having to assemble the plumbing that manually orchestrates a backend workflow for a Marlowe-based application.\nMarlowe has a refined view of the Cardano ledger model. Runtime s job is to map between the Marlowe conceptual model and the Cardano ledger model in both directions. Runtime takes commands relevant to the Marlowe ledger and maps them to the Cardano ledger. This can also be done with the REST API.\nPrimarily, you can do two types of things with Runtime:\nDiscovering and querying on-chain Marlowe contracts\nCreating Marlowe transactions\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Should I get a hardware wallet?",
    "completion": "If you're wondering whether you need a hardware wallet, the answer is probably yes. If you have an amount of cryptocurrency that you worry about losing, you should probably get one.\nUsing a Cardano wallet interface such as Yoroi, Daedalus, Flint, Eternl, etc. without a hardware wallet means that the cryptographic keys to your on-chain wallet are stored on your computer or mobile phone. The only thing protecting your wallet keys in this scenario is your spending password, and as the device is connected to the internet this leaves your wallet vulnerable to hacking attempts. A hacker could potentially decrypt your wallet keys and sign a transaction, sending all of your funds to themselves.\nIf you connect a hardware wallet such as a Ledger or Trezor device to one of the wallet interfaces mentioned above, the cryptographic keys to your wallet are stored on the hardware wallet itself. In this scenario, your cryptographic keys are never exposed to the internet-connected device and physical access to the device is required to sign a transaction. This makes your cryptocurrency wallet a lot more secure.\nHardware wallets also allow you to switch between wallet interfaces without having to type in your seed phrase. Every time you type your seed phrase into an internet-connected device, you are putting your wallet at risk. With a hardware wallet you can just pair it to the new wallet interface and you're good to go.\nA very important point to remember is that your hardware wallet is the only place you should ever enter your hardware wallet seed phrase. Never type your hardware wallet seed phrase into any Internet connected device such as your laptop or phone.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

Every 5 days there is a stake snapshot on the boundary of each epoch. Your staked ada will be active in your new stake pool after two epoch boundaries and you will receive rewards from your new stake pool after the fourth epoch boundary.\nYou also do not need to withdraw your staking rewards before switching stake pools.

    "prompt": "My light wallet is showing an incorrect balance or says Im not delegated to a Stake Pool?",
    "completion": "Cardano light wallets such as Yoroi, Eternl, Flint, Typhon, and others rely on servers to keep the blockchain information up to date. If you notice incorrect balances in your wallets, if your wallet says you are not delegated to a stake pool, or if you have some other issue, it may just be that the servers behind the wallet are experiencing sync issues.\nThink of the aforementioned wallets more as wallet interfaces. Your wallet is on the blockchain and Yoroi, Eternl, Flint, Typon, and others are just software applications you can use to view and interact with your on-chain wallet.\nTo view your actual balance, stake pool delegation, and more, you can enter your address (starting with 'addr1') or your stake key (starting with 'stake1') into cardanoscan.io. The 'Controlled Stake' section on the platform will show your whole balance including staking rewards.\nTo fix your wallet interface issues you could try resyncing. You can find a resync option in the settings of most light wallets. If this doesn't fix your issue and your wallet interface is still showing a different balance to cardanoscan.io, then you can use your seed phrase or hardware wallet to set up your wallet in a different wallet interface. You can have your wallet set up in multiple wallet interfaces at the same time, this also enables you to try the interfaces out and see which one is best for your needs.\nSwitching between wallet interfaces is a lot more secure when using a hardware wallet such as a Ledger or Trezor as you avoid the need to enter your seed phrase each time.

    "completion": "When setting up your hot wallet, i.e. a wallet that is not using a hardware wallet, you are prompted to choose a spending password. This spending password is used to encrypt your wallet keys which are stored on your device. Your spending password is the only thing protecting the keys to your wallet so it's important that you choose a secure password.\nIf you forget your spending password you will need to remove your wallet from your wallet interface (Eternl, Yoroi, Flint, Typhon etc) and restore your wallet using your seed phrase which is the list of 15 or 24 words that you were prompted to write down when initially setting up your wallet.\nShould I get a hardware wallet?\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "Ive lost the seed or recovery phrase for my wallet, what can I do?",
    "completion": "Your seed phrase is the list of words, normally 15 or 24, that you are prompted to write down when you create a wallet using a wallet interface such as Eternl, Yoroi, Daedalus, Flint etc. This list of words should be stored very securely, preferably in more than one location, on paper or maybe even punched into a metal sheet and stored in a secret location. There are many products available that enable you to store your seed phrase in a way that it is safe even in the most extreme conditions. If you loose access to your wallet, maybe your phone or laptop breaks or is stolen, or maybe you have forgotten your spending password, restoring your wallet in a wallet interface using your seed phrase is the only way that you will be able to regain access to it.\nIf you have lost access to your seed phrase but still have access to your wallet then you should immediately create a new wallet, storing the seed phrase securely, then transfer all of your funds to your new secure wallet. If you have been staking your ada then please see the following link:\nHow do I move all of my to a new wallet and claim my 2 stake key deposit?\nIf you have lost your seed phrase and do not have access to your wallet there is no way to retrieve your funds.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "How can I delegate to more than one Stake Pool?",
    "completion": "There are a a few reasons you may want to split your ada delegation between multiple stake pools. For example, to participate in multiple ISPOs, or you feel ethically aligned with more than one stake pool.\nCurrently there are two ways you can split your delegation.\nCreate new wallets This option is pretty straightforward and you will be familiar with this from when you set up your first wallet. You can simply create extra wallets which will have their own seed phrase, transfer funds between these wallets and delegate each wallet to a different stake pool.\nAdd additional accounts under the same wallet It is possible to add multiple additional accounts to your existing wallet. From a user perspective accounts act like separate wallets but they are recoverable using the same seed phrase or hardware wallet. Each account has its own receive address, transaction history, delegation history and stake key. Once you have set up an additional account you can send ada between accounts and delegate each account to a different Stake Pool if you wish. The multiple account feature is currently available in Eternl, Flint and some other wallets but not currently available in Daedalus or Yoroi.\nHow to set up and access additional accounts in Eternl Open the wallet for which you would like to add additional accounts. On the main account screen select account list then add accounts and select which accounts you would like to add. To switch between accounts select account list then select activate underneath the account you would like to access.\nHow to set up and access additional accounts in Flint Select the wallets icon in the top right corner then select add account under the wallet for which you would like to add an account and follow the on-screen instructions. To switch accounts select the wallet icon in the top right then select the account you would like to access.\nFor instructions on how to set up additional accounts in other wallet interfaces please see their documentation.\nIt s important to note that when restoring your wallet you will have to remember to add the accounts you want to access.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Is my ada safe when staking?",
    "completion": "This is a common question from people who are new to Cardano, who are familiar with staking on other blockchains, or who are moving their funds from an exchange to a self-custodial wallet such as Daedalus, Eternl, Flint, Typhon, Yoroi, and others.\nAs Cardano is a proof of stake (PoS) blockchain, it relies on holders delegating their ada to stake pools to secure the blockchain. In return they delegators are rewarded with ada. As Cardano relies on delegators taking part in this process it has been designed to be very secure.\nWhen a delegator stakes their ada on Cardano their funds do not leave their wallet, the staking mechanism therefore does not put the delegator's ada at risk.\nStaking is liquid, which means ada is not locked up for any period, delegators can move or spend their ada whenever they like.\nThe worst thing that could happen is that a stake pool underperforms, in which case a delegator may not receive all of the staking rewards. Even if this happens, the ada in the delegator's wallet is not at risk of being slashed or penalized in any way.\nIn line with the ethos of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, staking is completely trustless and staking rewards are distributed automatically by the protocol.\nA delegator can move to a new stake pool whenever they wish.\nYou can stake while using a hardware wallet and it is advisable to use one for extra security.

    "prompt": "How to mint an NFT project on Cardano using NFTMAKER?",
    "completion": "At NMKR, our goal is to make NFTs accessible to everyone.\nThis guide is designed for those in our community who have very little programming knowledge. Using this step-by-step process, you will be able to create and Mint your NFT project with ease using NMKR Studio.\nThe aim of this guide is to provide you with the optimal workflow for getting your project live, using our most up to date systems to ensure the best user experience.\nYou can review the information below or watch the video tutorial (6 minutes).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0SRI9QOdok\nIn every NFT drop, there are 5 high level tasks that need to be completed to ensure everything is technically ready for launch (assuming you have already generated your Art and have your Metadata ready).\nNMKR Studio Settings\nNMKR Studio Config\nUpload Base Media (The Art)\nUpload Metadata\nUser Minting Frontend (Website)\nThis section is designed to be a very quick overview that will likely save you considerable time and effort when getting your project ready, for a full guide you can review the Step-By-Step Workflow in the KnowledgeHub.\nIt is logically helpful to think about the NMKR Studio side in two parts, the first of which is settings and this covers all of the simple backend tasks such as:\nCreating your account\nVerifying your Payout wallet (where sale proceeds will go)\nPolicy ID\nNFT Pricing\nRoyalty Token\nSale Conditions\nReservation Time\nThese tasks don't take very long and are very simple to do using our user interface but they should remain in your mind throughout the project and should not be left until the 'last minute'.\nThe second part of NMKR Studio will be the more technically complex elements that need to be considered ahead of time to ensure the smoothest possible set up. This is specifically referring to the POLICY ID LOCKING and of course, the Metadata Template.\nCorrectly configuring the metadata is an important part of constructing your NFTs on the Cardano blockchain. Most projects currently use this as a place to describe the asset such as the serial number, what hat the character is wearing and how many attributes it has.\nIt is very important to think about the metadata you want to have well in advance so that you can align your art design, your source attribute files and your metadata template.\nThink about:\nWhat are the variables in my art? For example:\nDo they have hats, backgrounds, items, glasses, haircuts?\nIs it a video, a song and so on.\nHow granular do I want to be? For example:\nOne attribute for the 'background' like 'gradient-red'\nTwo attributes like 'bgstyle' = 'gradient', 'bgcolour' = 'red'\nDo I want the website/twitter/discord links in the metadata permanently?\nNote - each metadata attribute has a maximum limit of 64 Characters\nThe Policy ID is what identifies the unique collection of NFTs. As such this is something very important and you want to make sure that your community are made aware of the REAL Policy ID.\nIn terms of config, there really is only one thing to do here and that is to decide when the Policy ID locks. Having a locking policy date means that after that date, not further NFTs can be minted or edited in anyway under that Policy ID. In short - no further changes can be made and those assets will remain on the chain forever.\nPeople expect Policies to close at some point in the near future (less than a year) for several reasons, with the main one being that they know that once the policy locks, the supply of the NFTs is locked and thus their value wont be diluted by a rouge project who mints more.\nNote that the locking date can never be edited once set up, so think carefully about how long you need to mint your collection.\nNote - We highly recommend implementing a locking date on your project Policy ID\nOnce you have your art completed, you need to upload it to our servers so that it can remain there, ready to be minted. There are several ways that this can be done, with the best being via the SFTP Server but the API is available for those who prefer this.\nYou can upload additional subfiles for ***, such as:\nApplication: Zip; PDF; Json; GITF+Json, Octet-Stream\nAudio: Mpeg; Ogg; WAV.\nImage: Bmp; SVG+XML.\nText: HTML; Javascript; Plain Text; CSS.\nVideo: Mpeg; Mp4; Ogg; Quicktime; Webm.\nFurther information can be found in the Uploading Files section.\nThe best method of uploading your files is through our SFTP-Server (see guide). This allows you to upload, in bulk without needing to write code or use the API (literally drag-and-drop the files).\nIf you plan on using the SFTP server, this next part is essentially the same process as drag-and-drop as you did with the media files, only using the .metadata JSON files rather than the .PNG Image files or other media you might have already uploaded.\nHaving already completed the NMKR Studio Metadata Config, you will already have the template and placeholders ready to accept the Metdata and as such can start to upload this.\nWe also have a feature for people who are more familiar with spreadsheets, allowing you to upload the metadata using a single CSV file.\nThis final, very important step is all about how your community will actually mint your NFT's. We have made this very easy with various options for how this can be done, with the most recommended being to use our Payment Gateway on your website. The Payment Gateway provides by far the best end-user experience with a clean, professional interface that seamlessly integrates with the users wallet. If you don't plan on having a website, you can also use our single-pay in address as did many projects in the early months of NFTs on Cardano.\nAs a final headline overview, try and build your project in a way that means you can try things out with one or two files first, check it and then implement the bulk operations.\nYou may also want to use our Testnet to try things out first before you launch your project.\nThank you for choosing us as your Minting Partner - if you have any further queries that haven't been solved in this Knowledge Base - please contact our support teams who will be happy to help you.\nWe cant wait to see your project!\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

This Slot Leader Panel is quite helpful as it gives a good overview of all scheduled Slots in TimeSeries.\nUse cardano-cli to query the leadership schedule. Since the result has to interpreted by Grafana, we need to format the query output to a CSV readable syntax.\nNOTE\nThe cardano-cli query requires addtional RAM. I needed 16GB RAM + 8GB SWAP and it took several minutes to query the leadership schedule.\nThe whole script can be copied from here:\nSlot Leader Script\nIn case the slot.csv file is on a different node, copy it to your Grafana Monitoring node manually. This step could be automated but I don't wish to open extra ports for this so I just copy and paste the content of the slot.csv file.\nNext, we add the CSV Plugin to Grafana. Please follow the instructions under the section Installing on a local Grafana: .\nGrafana CSV Plugin\nAfter the installation, in Data Sources now the CSV Plugin should be listed. Configure the CSV Plugin by specifying the location of the slot.csv file. Save & Test and if all steps were followed correctly, you should get the green sucess messsage.\nThe final step is to add the Slot Leader Panel to your dashboard. For that click on the Add Panel and Add New Panel icons.\nThen click on Query inspector and JSON buttons.\nDelete the existing JSON code and replace it with the following:\nSlot Leader Panel\nNow click on Apply and that's it! You should be able to see all your Leader Slots from last 6 Hrs to next 18 Hrs and this time window shifts automaically.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

You can add different phases to control how you will sell the collection. For example, you might have a total of 5000 NFTs, and you want to sell them in three phases.\nYou can create a pre-sale phase to sell the first 1000 NFTs to previous customers at a special price and within a specific time range. You can identify these customers with a condition; that would be an NFT with one particular policy id on their wallets. Then you create another sale phase for the public drop with 3900 NFTs and no conditions, and last, you leave 100 NFTs as a reserve to mint in the last phase.\nsale phases\nNow you have the collection created and uploaded the files and metadata, it s time to define how you are going to sell the NFTs.\nHere we are going to create a sale phase for a pre-sale where we want to sell 1000 random NFTs. We have 4 price tiers and the buyers can select the tier they want to buy. For example, if a buyer want s to get 4 random NFTs they can select the Gold tier and pay 30 Ada.\nGenerate the sale phase with the price tiers and the links for the four buy buttons.\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://cardano-mainnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/nft/collections/<collection-id>/phases' \\ --header 'x-api-key: <your-api-key>' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --data-raw '{ \"name\": \"pre-sale\", \"type\": \"random\", \"total_tokens\": 1000, \"reservation_time\": 300, \"price_tiers\": [ { \"name\": \"Bronze\", \"quantity\": 1, \"supply\": 1, \"price\": 10000000 }, { \"name\": \"Silver\", \"quantity\": 2, \"supply\": 1, \"price\": 20000000 }, { \"name\": \"Gold\", \"quantity\": 4, \"supply\": 1, \"price\": 30000000 }, { \"name\": \"Platinum\", \"quantity\": 8, \"supply\": 1, \"price\": 60000000 } ] }'\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://cardano-mainnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/nft/collections/<collection-id>/phases' \\ --header 'x-api-key: <your-api-key>' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --data-raw '{ \"name\": \"pre-sale\", \"type\": \"random\", \"total_tokens\": 1000, \"reservation_time\": 300, \"price_tiers\": [ { \"name\": \"Bronze\", \"quantity\": 1, \"supply\": 1, \"price\": 10000000 }, { \"name\": \"Silver\", \"quantity\": 2, \"supply\": 1, \"price\": 20000000 }, { \"name\": \"Gold\", \"quantity\": 4, \"supply\": 1, \"price\": 30000000 }, { \"name\": \"Platinum\", \"quantity\": 8, \"supply\": 1, \"price\": 60000000 } ] }'\nResponse:\nIn the response, we can see that each price tier has an associated payment link.

    "prompt": "How to listen to onchain events in realtime on Cardano using Tangocrypto Notify?",
    "completion": "With Notify you'll will be able to integrate production-ready notifications with our webhooks and SDKs integrations. Get access to all of the blockchain events your users might care about, like successful transactions, payments, minted blocks by a pool, new delegations and whatnot.\nPayments and transactions: Allow sending notifications to users to know when their deposits, purchases, in-game actions or other on-chain activity has officially occurred.\nAddress Activity Webhooks: Let your users know when transaction activity occurs on their address. No more refreshing the page or having to use the dust to identify a payment.\nSmart Retries: Sometimes receiving endpoints fail or hang more often than you think. That s why we provide automatic retries to ensure deliverability.\nMonitoring and debug: We log every triggered webhook so you can monitor their deliverability to different endpoints, disable failing ones and notify your customers.\nDevelopment experience: Offer your users a great developer experience, including the ability to test and inspect their webhooks.\nA webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently in order to get it real-time. This makes webhooks much more efficient for both provider and consumer. Webhooks work by registering a URL to send notifications once certain events occur.\nYou can think that Webhooks are like a phone number that Tangocrypto calls to notify you of activity in Cardano. The activity could be a payment to an address or reaching a particular epoch. The webhook endpoint is the person answering that call who takes actions based upon the specific information it receives.\nA webhook endpoint is just more code on your server, which could be written in Node.js, Go, Java, Ruby, or whatever. The webhook endpoint has an associated URL (e.g. https://myserver.com/callback). The Tangocrypto notifications are Event objects. This Event object contains all the relevant information about what just happened, including the type of event and the data associated with that event. The webhook endpoint uses the event details to take any required actions, such as indicating that an NFT should be sent to a wallet.\nhttps://myserver.com/callback\nWebhooks vs. WebSockets: The difference between webhooks and WebSockets is that webhooks can only facilitate one-way communication between two services, while WebSockets can facilitate two-way communication between a user and a service, recognizing events and displaying them to the user as they occur.\nThe Event structure always begins with the following parameters:\n{ \"id\": \"2921e3df-c671-4d20-b51b-d176d5c1e43g\", //** Unique uuid per event .** \"api_version\": \"1.0\", //**Represents the current Tangocrypto API version, which is v1.** \"webhook_id\": \"d012a60eccb54c2ba97484f98137be56\", // identifies the webhook \"idempotency_key\": \"3b3359d0ccdb1d3d3ca8dbaa79cb5395b33c5bc52d782f3ea22904abef45d1j4\", //**Specifies a unique ID used by Tangocrypto to recognize consecutive requests with the same data so that not to perform the same operation twice.** \"object\": \"event\", \"create_date\": 1633954086377, \"type\": \"payment\", // event type ... }\n{ \"id\": \"2921e3df-c671-4d20-b51b-d176d5c1e43g\", //** Unique uuid per event .** \"api_version\": \"1.0\", //**Represents the current Tangocrypto API version, which is v1.** \"webhook_id\": \"d012a60eccb54c2ba97484f98137be56\", // identifies the webhook \"idempotency_key\": \"3b3359d0ccdb1d3d3ca8dbaa79cb5395b33c5bc52d782f3ea22904abef45d1j4\", //**Specifies a unique ID used by Tangocrypto to recognize consecutive requests with the same data so that not to perform the same operation twice.** \"object\": \"event\", \"create_date\": 1633954086377, \"type\": \"payment\", // event type ... }\nid Unique identifier per Event.\nid\napi_version The event scheme you receive depends on the version of the Tangocrypto API. Currently, we use v1. When you set a subscription for an event while using v1 of the API, the callback will be returned according to v1 specifics. Each time we update our API to the next version you will have to reset your Event subscriptions so that they correspond to the newest version currently in use. To do that you'll need to remove the event subscription and set it up again. Otherwise, the callback response will be received in the format of the older API version it was set up in.\napi_version\nwebhook_id The webhook_id indicates a reference to the webhook and It's is a unique code. Each time you set up an event subscription, the corresponding Event always has a parameter webhook_id.\nwebhook_id\nwebhook_id\nidempotency_key Idempotency represents a process in computing and REST that a server uses to recognise subsequent retries of the same request where the returned result always remains the same. It is a security mechanism for retrying requests without the risk of performing the same operation more than once.\nidempotency_key\nSuch risks usually can occur when an API call is for some reason disrupted during processing (e.g. network connection error) and a response is not returned. In such cases, the API call would be retried. By including an idempotency_id in the initial request there is a guarantee that the specific action won t be done more than once. The idempotency_id is generated only by Tangocrypto webhooks. It is added to the Event and is unique per triggered webhook.\nidempotency_id\nTangocrypto offers 5 different types of webhooks:\nPayments\nBlock\nTransaction\nEpoch\nDelegation\nCallback requests sent from Tangocrypto are always POST and it contains a JSON payload;\nThe Payment Webhook allows you to track payments to an address. This provides your app with real-time state changes when an address sends or receives tokens.\nPayload example\n{ \"id\": \"3c23ff25-481c-4e3e-859b-f515135a49b0\", \"data\": { \"transaction\": {

    "prompt": "How to start developing on Cardano using Tangocrypto API?",
    "completion": "We provide a suite of high availability APIs and developer tools for fast and reliable access to the Cardano network that requires only 1 minute to integrate. As a developer starting on Cardano you will face the following problems:\nThere's no way to access the information on a blockchain without using a node or an API provider.\nYou will have to start creating the infrastructure instead of focusing on your products and business.\nIn-house infrastructure doesn t scale automatically when user demand increases.\nThere is a high learning curve, a broader error surface and an increase in cost when building integrations with several API services from multiple providers.\nWe provide a unified platform where you'll be able to:\nShip products faster and validate business ideas.\nUse one platform to fetch, submit and listen to on-chain information, mint tokens, store files and process payments.\nGrow their user base by relying on an elastic infrastructure capable of handling spikes in consumption without downtime.\nReduce cost on engineering and infrastructure operations.\nOur solution provides the following components:\nREST API\nNotify (Webhooks)\nNFT API\nYou can create a free account and start coding your next product.\nThe HTTP REST API goal is to make development faster and easier. There is no need for syncing with the blockchain and maintaining complicated setups. No more complex and multiple requests to the blockchain from different entry points, the developers can get all the data they need for transactions, token information and debugging, in fewer requests.\nWe provide the most accessible and reliable Cardano infrastructure, freeing companies and developers from the responsibility to maintain complex infrastructures and focusing instead on building their business logic and providing value to their customers.\nEnterprise-grade infrastructure: Harness the processing power of our globally distributed cloud-hosted node network. Our API alleviates the friction of maintaining your own compute and storage resources, lowering the barrier to entry for developers and enterprises.\nBuilt for developers: Easy to read documentation and resources to help developers get started quickly.\nGain app insights: Our dashboard provides direct insights about API usage. Drill down into specific request methods and get response times, most used endpoints, usage by time of the day, IP address, countries and more. These insights are a great way to optimize applications based on user behaviour.\nStandard Interface: Supports Mainnet and Testnet via client-compatible REST API over HTTPS.\nAlways Online: Running on the latest network upgrades with a minimum 99.9 uptime guarantee.\nYou can choose the mainnet or the testnet for your queries. The API requires a valid app_id to be included with your request traffic. This identifier should be appended to the request URL.\napp_id\nNetwork\nCardano mainnet: https://cardano-mainnet.tangocrypto.com/{app_id}/v1\nhttps://cardano-mainnet.tangocrypto.com/{app_id}/v1\nCardano testnet: https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/{app_id}/v1\nhttps://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/{app_id}/v1\nWhen you sign up on https://www.tangocrypto.com and create an App an x-api-key is created. You must include the HTTP header x-api-key in every request in order to authenticate the API calls.\nx-api-key\nx-api-key\nCheck our API full reference documentation here\nTo use Tangocrypto's products, you need an API key to authenticate your requests.\nYou can create API keys from the dashboard, just click on +Create App, name it and hit create:\nOnce your app is created just copy you app-id and x-api-key and start making requests.\nx-api-key\nWith the app-id and the x-api-key you can make requests. For example, let's make a request to get the latest block number:\nx-api-key\ncurl --location \\ --request GET 'https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/blocks/latest' \\ --header 'x-api-key: <your-api-key>'\ncurl --location \\ --request GET 'https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/blocks/latest' \\ --header 'x-api-key: <your-api-key>'\nYou should get something like this:\n{ \"id\": \"3064146\", \"hash\": \"f8eadfc91c3219b3d00d4a902174e0978e449f0e8a6f6b0584e06bbbedc0d050\", \"epoch_no\": 158, \"slot_no\": 38197024, \"epoch_slot_no\": 310624, \"block_no\": 2940877, \"previous_block\": 2940876, \"slot_leader\": \"pool1rcsezjrma577f06yp40lsz76uvwh7gne35afx3zrq2ktx50f8t8\", \"size\": 365, \"time\": \"2021-09-25T10:37:20.000Z\", \"tx_count\": 1, \"out_sum\": 435928446, \"fees\": 171441, \"op_cert\": \"333e175db9a2f89de5d9396c10b4dd136c3fffebd7f22d2eb0a3e8ef3884199c\", \"vrf_key\": \"vrf_vk1ltjt3ucuvah43gpeqpw4n6say9u6s0kju8c8q76xctmvgsqawgrq7kj48j\", \"confirmations\": 1 }\n{ \"id\": \"3064146\", \"hash\": \"f8eadfc91c3219b3d00d4a902174e0978e449f0e8a6f6b0584e06bbbedc0d050\", \"epoch_no\": 158, \"slot_no\": 38197024, \"epoch_slot_no\": 310624, \"block_no\": 2940877, \"previous_block\": 2940876, \"slot_leader\": \"pool1rcsezjrma577f06yp40lsz76uvwh7gne35afx3zrq2ktx50f8t8\", \"size\": 365, \"time\": \"2021-09-25T10:37:20.000Z\", \"tx_count\": 1, \"out_sum\": 435928446, \"fees\": 171441, \"op_cert\": \"333e175db9a2f89de5d9396c10b4dd136c3fffebd7f22d2eb0a3e8ef3884199c\", \"vrf_key\": \"vrf_vk1ltjt3ucuvah43gpeqpw4n6say9u6s0kju8c8q76xctmvgsqawgrq7kj48j\", \"confirmations\": 1 }\nSome API endpoints paginate their responses to make the result set easier to handle. For example, if you request a list of objects that are potentially too large to run efficiently, the endpoint returns the first batch of results along with a cursor to access the next set of results.\nThe query results are divided into \"pages\" of 1 MB in size (or less) data. An application can process the first page of results, then the second page, etc. You include the cursor in subsequent requests to the endpoint as a URL query parameter of your request.\nTo determine whether there are more results and to retrieve them one page at a time, applications should do the following:\nMake a request with the desired size and check the result, if the cursor is not empty, construct a new request with the same parameters as the previous one.

Together with the ledger team, they have proposed a solution to reduce memory allocations when serializing the ledger state.\nThe team drafted scripts to estimate the necessary bandwidth to ensure the CPU is the bottleneck during syncing, informing refinements to the BlockFetch process.\nBlockFetch\nOn the UTXO-HD front, the team:\nAddressed benchmarking issues, after which the utxo-hd-9.1 branch showed good results, with memory and CPU usage nearly matching the 9.1 node.\nutxo-hd-9.1\n9.1\nProvided a new tool that allows users to convert ledger state snapshots from pre-UTXO-HD to UTXO-HD without replaying the chain.\nOnce the quality engineering team finalizes work on integration tests on the utxo-hd-9.1 branch, the consensus team will update documentation and prepare the branch for merging.\nutxo-hd-9.1\nNote that this UTXO-HD release utilizes an LMDB backend and also provides an in-memory backend. The LSM-tree backend is expected to be available in Q1 2025. The UTXO-HD release also represents the first phase in transitioning parts of the ledger state to disk storage, significantly reducing memory requirements and contributing to Cardano s long-term sustainability.\nThis week, the Plutus team continued improving the user documentation, with significant updates made to the following pages: Troubleshooting, Plutus Core and Plutus Tx, Glossary, and Producing a Plutus contract blueprint. They also fixed a bug related to the generation of Plutus contract blueprints.\nThis week, the Hydra team released version 0.19.0 of the hydra-node, which upgrades the ledger to Conway while maintaining compatibility with Babbage transactions. They made small improvements to the TUI, and initial investigations into Head-in-Head operations, where one Hydra head could launch another, were conducted. Although not yet supported, this feature is under consideration for future development. Moving forward, the team will continue work on incremental commits, explore a Blockfrost chain layer, enhance core networking, and plan upcoming Hydra Doom-related work.\nThe Mithril team continued working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. They kept implementing a buffer store for individual signatures that may arrive before being processed by an aggregator, worked on refactoring the signer state machine, and started developing a mechanism to support specific configurations for signing Cardano transactions. Additionally, they fixed the panics occurring in the signer and aggregator during Cardano chain rollbacks.\nFinally, the team continued preparing the next distribution and investigated a problem preventing the consistent certification of Cardano transactions in the pre-release-preview network.\npre-release-preview\nNow that Intersect has completed the first stage of the Chang upgrade, elections are underway for seven committees and the membership board. There are more applicants than seats for all positions, so the election will be meaningful and enthusiastically contested.\nAnnual members meetings will be held worldwide in early October, followed by a virtual town hall.\nThis week in Catalyst, town hall 175 was held, and Fund13 will be officially launched during next week's town hall. Meanwhile, technical development of Hermes/Athena continues, and the support of Fund13 parameters and guardrails is ongoing.\nThis week, the education team made their final preparations for the Cardano Days event in Wyoming on Saturday, September 21, and are organizing the Cardano Days event in Santander, Spain.

    "completion": "This week, the ledger team implemented a new Conway-related feature that disallows stake credentials from withdrawing rewards if they are backed by a key hash and not delegated to any DRep. This feature will become effective after the bootstrap phase. The team also worked on additional tests and fixed several minor bugs, including GovInfoEvent ledger event and ledger state deserialization bugs, which was necessary for the node v.9.1.1 release. The team also addressed technical debt by cleaning up unnecessary predicate failures and fixing flaky tests from Byron and Alonzo ledger eras.\nGovInfoEvent\nThe performance and tracing team released benchmarks for node v.9.1.1. They also created a local tool to replicate the observed increase in UTXO-HD RAM usage, established a new performance baseline named 'Age of Voltaire', and started testing the adjusted Nomad backend. Infrastructure improvements include removing the requirement for Vault and optimizing cluster setups. In the tracing area, the team integrated a new metrics naming schema and continued working on routing adjustments to internal monitoring servers along with eliminating some dependencies.\nVault\nThe Mithril team continued working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. In this preliminary phase, they kept implementing a buffer store for individual signatures that may arrive before being processed by an aggregator. They also worked on refactoring the state machine of the signer and addressed panics occurring in both the signer and aggregator during rollbacks of Cardano transactions. Additionally, they modified the pre-loading mechanism for importing Cardano transactions, ensuring it repeats indefinitely in the signer.\nFinally, the team continued preparing the next distribution and investigated a breaking change introduced in a Hydra CI dependency.\nDuring the Voltaire development phase, the Cardano blockchain is led and overseen by Intersect MBO members (including Input | Output), which enables the whole community to shape Cardano's future through the governing board and committees.\nYou now have the opportunity to participate. Applications for committee and board seats are currently open and will close on September 27.\nPlease be aware that only full members (those with paid memberships) are eligible to stand for election and vote.\nFor inquiries regarding your membership status or any questions, please refer to Intersect's knowledge base or join the dedicated Discord channel.\nThese resources can be accessed through your member portal or the following links:\nApplication form for committee elections\nApplication form for board seat elections.\nThe team is excited to announce that they have already received several applications, which can be accessed through the links below.

    "completion": "The core technology teams released Cardano node v.9.1.1 to address an issue where 9.1.0 nodes would replay from the genesis block upon restart during the Conway era. See the Voltaire section for more details.\nThe consensus team introduced a snapshot-converter tool that allows non-UTXO-HD ledger snapshots to be converted into UTXO-HD ones, eliminating the need for replaying from genesis when using UTXO-HD nodes. This tool also resolves a deserialization issue with TxOuts in Conway. The team further addressed a memory leak in the UTXO-HD implementation, with benchmarking scheduled for this week.\nTxOuts\nConway\nIn addition, the team expanded the mempool capacity beyond byte size, developed a test for adding large transactions, and discovered a bug related to Conway ledger snapshot deserialization.\nThe Lace team has opened up governance to Conway-era hardware wallet users, improving access and functionality in Lace v.1.15. The user experience with the DApp connector is now smoother following the resolution of some bugs. Looking ahead, the team is now preparing for the release of Lace v.1.16.\nThis week, the Plutus team wrapped up development on the built-in functions planned for release with the next hard fork, including the remaining bitwise primitives and the RIPEMD-160 hash function.\nThis week, the Hydra team established a solid foundation for network resilience tests, identifying areas for potential networking improvements. They made progress on incremental commits, specifically in handling deposits, and developed strategies to resolve issues with stuck funds . Additionally, enhancements were made to the usability of new features and related documentation in the changelog. Looking ahead, the team plans to switch the ledger to the Conway era and prepare for the upcoming release while continuing to refine incremental commits.\nThe Mithril team kept working on decentralizing the signature orchestration of the Mithril network. In this preliminary phase, they began implementing a buffer store for individual signatures that may arrive before being processed by an aggregator. Additionally, they moved the broadcast of signer registrations to the aggregator s epoch settings route. The team also monitored the Chang upgrade to ensure the Mithril networks operated correctly and cleaned up unnecessary code. Additionally, they implemented a seamless transition from unstable to stable features in the WASM client.\nFinally, the team activated a feature allowing the selection of the arithmetic backend used by Mithril cryptography in the client and refactored the organization of signer dependencies.\nAs scheduled, on Sunday, September 1, 2024, at 21:54:00 UTC, the Cardano blockchain took the first major, irrevocable step from being one of the most decentralized blockchains to becoming an ecosystem governed solely by its community of ada holders.\nAs expected, the chain continued to run uninterrupted, as it has since inception. There were no emergency calls, and the standby engineers were not needed.\nThe only significant issue was that, under certain circumstances, a node that was restarted took up to two hours longer than it should to sync because it was replaying from genesis instead of resyncing from where it left off. Cardano engineers from Intersect and Input|Output identified and solved the issue, and released a new version of Cardano node, v.9.1.1, as a hotfix less than 24 hours after the hard fork. The engineers recommend that all nodes upgrade to v.9.1.1.\nThe v.9.1.0 upgrade introduced some improvements, carried forward in v.9.1.1, to the transaction cost model that DApps need to take into account. A detailed explanation, including the rationale for the change, is described in the Cardano ledger documentation. Costs are compared in the ref script calculator.\nThis week in Catalyst, the Fund12 onboarding process is progressing smoothly, with 98.5 of onboarding forms completed, 94 of statements of milestones submitted, and 84 signed off. Due diligence is 54 complete, and 75 of test transactions are done. Although the cool-down period is still active, register here as Town Halls will resume next week. Essential Hermes modules are advancing, with M3 POA submitted last week. Work on Catalyst Voices wallet integration continues, focusing on architecture rework to improve the performance of the chain indexer on mainnet.\nThis week, the education team continued preparing for the upcoming Cardano Days event in Wyoming later this month and the Cardano Days event coming soon in Santander, Spain.

This hard fork will take effect on the Cardano mainnet on September 1, and it is the first of two hard forks in the Chang upgrade. The Intersect working group has been working closely with stake pool operators (SPOs), exchanges, and developers of decentralized applications (DApps) to prepare for this.\nThe SPOs are ready, as 92 of stake is on pools running Cardano node v.9.1.0. Exchanges are also prepared, with 92 of liquidity held by exchanges upgraded to v.9.1.0. Most DApps are ready, and no high-severity issues have been raised.\nThere will be a special X Space to highlight the event as we cross the epoch boundary.\nIn addition, contingency plans are in place, with technical first responders on standby to offer support in case of unexpected events around the hard fork. For more information, see Intersect s blog.\nThis week in Catalyst, the Fund12 onboarding process is advancing into its next phases, ensuring smooth integration for new projects. Additionally, the Hermes project has reached significant progress with the successful delivery of Milestone 3.\nThe education team is preparing content and organizing logistics for Cardano Days events next month.

    "completion": "Input Output Global (IOG) a r uni une quipe d'ing nieurs sp cialis s pour utiliser la base solide de Cardano afin de cr er une bo te outils pour la construction de cha nes lat rales (dites \"sidechains\") personnalis es. l'aide de cette bo te outils, ils ont construit un testnet public sidechain-compatible avec la machine virtuelle Ethereum (EVM) comme preuve de concept. Les sidechains rendent Cardano extensible et plus volutif sans compromettre la stabilit ou la s curit de la cha ne principale.\nCardano est une blockchain de troisi me g n ration, bas e sur des recherches universitaires et crite en Haskell pour etablir une preuve math matique d'exactitude.\nLa d centralisation, la s curit et l' volutivit du protocole de consensus Ouroboros ont t prouv es grande chelle et en volume par des milliers Stake pools ind pendants et des millions d'adresses de portefeuille pendant plus de cinq ans. Le r seau fonctionne sans d faillance depuis sa cr ation en 2017.\nLa d centralisation et l'interop rabilit sont essentielles pour l'avenir de la blockchain. Ces fonctionnalit s garantissent qu'aucune personne ou entit ne peut contr ler une blockchain ou tre limit e un seul cosyst me. Pour se d velopper, d'un point de vue technique et social, la plupart des applications et des communaut s doivent tre dot es de leur propre souverainet et de leurs propres choix de conception.\nPour permettre cet environnement interop rable, IOG a travaill sur la cr ation d'une bo te outils pour construire une famille de sidechains. Avec cette bo te outils, n'importe qui peut commencer tirer parti de la s curit et de l'infrastructure de Cardano pour cr er des sidechains sp cifiques leurs missions. Les Cha ne lat rale EVM prouve la faisabilit de ce concept. Tout ce travail est partag avec la communaut Cardano et sera enti rement open source. La premi re tape a t la d monstration de l'application EVM IO ScotFest Edinburg fin novembre 2022. IOG a mis disposition la premi re tranche de documentation formelle.\nUne sidechain est simplement une blockchain qui d pend de sa cha ne principale et qui lui est connect e.\nLa bo te outils permet la sidechain d'avoir son propre algorithme de consensus et ses propres fonctionnalit s. La sidechain est connect e la cha ne principale via un pont qui permet le transfert d'atouts entre les cha nes. La finalit des blocs est d termin e par un m canisme de consensus qui repose sur la s curit de la cha ne principale.\nLa bo te outils est compos e de :\nScripts Plutus de la cha ne principale: Ces scripts s'ex cutent sur la cha ne principale de Cardano, permettent des transactions inter-cha nes s curis es et des mouvements de tokens, et utilisent les proc dures de minting pour prendre en charge le token de la cha ne lat rale.\nUn suiveur de cha ne: Le suiveur de cha ne suit les donn es et les v nements de la cha ne principale qui r gissent la cha ne lat rale. Dans la version v1 de la bo te outils, il s'agit d'un Cardano instance de synchronisation de base de donn es.\nLe module de cha ne lat rale: Ce module fait partie du client sidechain. Il interpr te les donn es de la cha ne principale et met en uvre les adaptations n cessaires du grand livre.\nLa bo te outils est galement livr e avec un document de sp cification technique contenant une introduction et un guide des sidechains Cardano. Les blocs de construction de la bo te outils sont con us pour donner des pouvoirs aux d veloppeurs. Quelques exemples:\nD placer des donn es et des atouts entre la cha ne principale et la cha ne lat rale personnalis e.\nPrendre en charge divers protocoles de consensus, r gles du ledger et langues.\nS curiser le lancement de sidechains.\nS curiser les petites cha nes.\nPermettre l'exp rimentation, l'incubation et la recherche.\nL'application sidechain EVM est disponible en tant que testnet publique. Les d veloppeurs peuvent l'essayer en ex cutant quelques applications Solidity pour avoir une id e de son potentiel. Les d veloppeurs de DApp utilisant la sidechain EVM doivent noter que les donn es doivent tre consid r es comme finales sur la cha ne principale avant d' tre d plac es vers la sidechain.\nLes d veloppeurs de cha nes de blocs, les d veloppeurs d'applications distribu es (DApp), les stake pool operators (SPO) et les utilisateurs de DApp peuvent tous b n ficier de sidechains personnalis es. Les d veloppeurs peuvent utiliser la bo te outils pour cr er des blockchains pour des cas d'utilisation sp cifiques bas s sur la s curit et la d centralisation de Cardano.\nLes cha nes de blocs cr es de cette mani re peuvent tirer parti du soutien de la communaut SPO existante et b n ficier de la communaut enthousiaste des followers de Cardano.\nPour les d veloppeurs de DApps, les sidechains personnalis es offrent des avantages en termes d'interop rabilit , d' volutivit , de testabilit et de compatibilit .\nInterop rabilit\nLa forme de communication la plus basique entre une cha ne principale et une cha ne secondaire est l' change d'atouts. tant donn que les atouts conservent leur nature lorsqu'ils sont transf r s vers la sidechain, ils peuvent tre retransf r s tout aussi facilement. Un m canisme de pont permet cette communication. Tant que les deux cha nes sont s curis es, cette s curit est r percut e sur les transferts dans les deux sens.\nLa communication entre la cha ne principale et la cha ne lat rale leur permet de conserver leurs propres protocoles de consensus (qu'ils soient modifi s) et leurs formats de bloc tout en continuant travailler ensemble, donnant ainsi access une plus large gamme d'applications.\nvolutivit\nTout comme un chef de projet a le choix entre bon, rapide ou bon march (choisissez-en deux), une blockchain a le choix entre trois objectifs concurrents : la d centralisation, la s curit et l' volutivit .\ntant donn que les sidechains peuvent tre sp cifiques un domaine d'application, les transactions peuvent tre effectu es plus rapidement, soulageant la cha ne principale de cette charge. L am lioration de l' volutivit des sidechains ne compromet pas la s curit et n'a pas besoin d'affecter la d centralisation.\nTestabilit\nLes d veloppeurs peuvent tester des DApps pilotes sur des sidechains d di es. S'il y a une panne n cessitant un red marrage ou une modification de l'interface avec la cha ne, alors seule la cha ne lat rale est affect e, pas la cha ne principale. Cette phase agit comme une tape interm diaire entre le fonctionnement du testnet et la version compl te du r seau principal pour les fonctionnalit s exp rimentales et les nouvelles applications.\nCompatibilit\nLes sidechains peuvent exposer la m me interface de programme d'application (API) qu'une cha ne existante et utiliser la s curit et l'efficacit des protocoles de consensus de Cardano. Par exemple, la cha ne lat rale Cardano EVM fournit un environnement d'ex cution Solidity qui ne n cessite pas de mineurs, mais qui sert toujours les m thodes Ethereum JSON RPC. Les smart contrats Ethereum peuvent fonctionner sans changement, des frais de gaz consid rablement inf rieurs.\nLes sidechains offrent une opportunit aux SPOs en permettant leurs pools d'attribuer plus de tokens que juste ada s'ils d cident d'ex cuter galement un n ud de sidechain. Ces tokens sp cifiques la sidechain peuvent servir diff rentes fins et leur tour inciter les d l gants participer au r seau. Selon la fa on dont les r compenses sont configur es sur la sidechain, les cr ateurs de blocs de sidechain peuvent tre r compens s par de nouveaux tokens pour construire des blocs, les valider et contribuer la s curit du r seau. Tout Cardano SPO peut choisir de valider galement les blocs sur la sidechain. S'ils le font, ils peuvent b n ficier de revenus suppl mentaires pour fournir des services suppl mentaires et utiliser plus de ressources.\nSi un SPO choisit de valider les blocs sidechain, il devra fournir des ressources suppl mentaires. Un peu d'espace disque est n cessaire pour stocker la sidechain, et ils doivent ex cuter deux processus suppl mentaires ; un suiveur de cha ne et un n ud de sidechain.\nUne plus grande interop rabilit entre les cha nes, des processus de d veloppement simplifi s, plus de plateformes de d veloppement et des frais de transaction r duits ont tendance augmenter le nombre et la vari t des DApp. Plus de sidechains Cardano signifie une plus grande vari t de conceptions de cha nes de blocs innovantes, des cas d'utilisation et des r compenses de staking plus lev es, ce qui a tendance attirer plus de SPO et de d l gants, et garantit par cons quent une s curit accrue et une plus grande d centralisation. Ceci est le potentiel de l' cosyst me des sidechains.\nLa bo te outils sidechain est la derni re livraison de la roadmap de Cardano au sein de Basho, la phase de mise l' chelle, introduisant la programmabilit , l interop rabilit et l volutivit plus lev es. Le d veloppement des sidechains ouvre la voie une adoption massive de Cardano en permettant un d bit beaucoup plus lev sans r duction de la d centralisation ou de la s curit . Les d veloppeurs de blockchain peuvent cr er plus facilement des sidechains personnalis es. terme, IOG esp re voir merger une famille de sidechains Cardano et de cha nes partenaires.\nLe testnet public de la sidechain EVM a t publi , permettant la communaut de d ployer des DApps, de cr er des smart contrats et de transf rer des tokens entre les cha nes de test.\nLa bo te outils publi e en janvier n'est pas une solution compl te. Il existe des domaines d'am lioration connus, tels que l'exp rience de pont, le m canisme de r compenses SPO et le mod le de s curit . Tous ces domaines seront am lior s avec la communaut au fur et mesure - soigneusement et r guli rement - en collaborant pour obtenir des commentaires, des r flexions et des recommandations.\nDe nombreuses am liorations peuvent tre apport es et il existe de nombreuses fa ons de g rer une sidechain.

There is no need, as some other chains, to send redundant internal transactions every minute to keep the network running etc. But that's also why Cardano can't boast a ridiculous number of millions of TPS - because the network is really only running real transactions.

Over five development phases, IOG introduced innovations, new functionality, and novel features, with each phase building upon the previous phase's achievements\nIntroduction\nThe story of Cardano began in 2015, with a vision of addressing the three strategic challenges facing all blockchain networks: scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. Two years, thousands of GitHub commits, and hundreds of hours of study later, the first version of Cardano Cardano Byron shipped in September 2017.\nByron allowed users to buy and sell the ada cryptocurrency so named after the revolutionary mathematician Ada Lovelace on a federated network running the groundbreaking Ouroboros consensus protocol. The heart of the Cardano network, Ouroboros is the first proof-of-stake protocol based on academic, peer-reviewed research, with a mathematically-proven level of security.\nThe Byron reboot updated multiple components of the Cardano network, including the Cardano node, the Cardano explorer, and the wallet backend, and also delivered Daedalus, IOG s official desktop wallet. Yoroi, a light wallet from EMURGO built on original development work from IOG and designed for quick transactions and day-to-day use, was also delivered. To track the history of ada transactions, Byron included a Block Explorer a tool specifically designed for browsing chain activity.\nAs much as Byron was about the first crucial technology development, it was also about building a community and getting people involved in creating the blockchain of the future. It allowed Cardano to grow from a small group of enthusiasts to a global community, with ada hosted on more than 30 cryptocurrency exchanges.\nFurther reading:\nChapter 2.

    "prompt": "What IOG has delivered for Cardano. Shelley decentralizing the blockchain?",
    "completion": "Cardano s development is guided by a methodical, research-based, and deliberate approach to innovation. Over five development phases, IOG introduced innovations, new functionality, and novel features, with each phase building upon the previous phase's achievements.\nIntroduction\nChapter 1. Byron: the foundation of Cardano\nShelley created a decentralized economic system that drives Cardano s growth and optimization. Moving away from Byron's federated network maintenance, more and more nodes were run by the Cardano community in a progressive evolution to full decentralization. Since the launch of Shelley, Cardano has gained over three thousand stake pool operators (SPOs). The SPO community greatly contributed to the success of the Shelley launch, playing an integral role in Cardano s evolution from the early days of the ITN to the mainnet fork, and beyond.\nShelley focused on several critical steps to ensure an enhanced user experience for stake pool operations, delegation preferences, and incentives. As a proof-of-stake blockchain, Shelley allowed users to stake their ada to participate in network consensus. Painstakingly designed using game theory and the latest research into proof-of-stake networks, the delegation and incentive mechanism encourages users to delegate their stake to stake pools always-on, community-run network nodes and be rewarded for honest participation in the network.\nSince the launch of Shelley, the IOG team has worked on many new features and upgrades, all intended to improve and optimize the user experience for both delegators and SPOs.\nThe staking and delegation strategies underwent parameter changes and calculation improvements, focusing on long-term benefits for the community rather than one-off profit. To level the playing field, IOG changed the network parameters to allow an even spread of the stake across the network, thus eliminating the potential for larger stake pools to dominate the ecosystem. SPOs and ada delegators could then experience more favorable staking opportunities for network sustainability and continuous returns.\nIn March 2021, block production on Cardano became fully decentralized when the d parameter was set to 0. This placed the responsibility for block production in the hands of the SPO community.\nAlong with these significant enhancements, IOG worked to expand Cardano s functionality. For a better stake pool operation experience, RTView enabled real-time monitoring of node activities. IOG deployed the transaction metadata feature to allow the embedding of specific data to transactions, which was useful prior to smart contract support implementation.\nFinally, data accountability has always played an integral role in staking and delegation. To enable better stake pool data tracking and maintenance, IOG implemented the SMASH system for recording stake pool metadata and has continuously improved the ranking system within the Daedalus wallet. These upgrades were based on user feedback and scientific research, which have driven user interface and user experience enhancements so that both SPOs and ada holders can seamlessly navigate between pools and their respective data.\nShelley represented the natural maturation of the network, making it more useful, rewarding, and valuable for existing users new and old. Shelley was also about preparing for the future. Setting the stage for a distributed and functional network, Shelley laid the groundwork for Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.\nFurther reading:\nChapter 3.

    "prompt": "Staking is the bedrock of Cardano?",
    "completion": "Original author: Anthony Quinn\nEach month, a few more Cardano stake pools are being created, so far bringing the total number of active pools to more than 3,000. At the start of 2021, there were about 2,000. The ada is staked from 1.2 million wallet addresses. In the process, the level of delegation has increased to almost 74 of all the ada in circulation. That s some achievement, but it still leaves a quarter of all ada yet to be staked does that matter?\nThe short answer is yes, for two reasons. First, staking is what secures the Cardano network, so the more ada staked the better. And second, on an individual level, ada holders who have not delegated their coins are missing out on the rewards that are distributed to stake pools for verifying transactions and producing blocks.\nThe idea of proof of stake (PoS) is now so established that it s easy to forget what a massive innovation it is. The delays in Ethereum trying to move from proof of work (PoW) show how difficult PoS is to implement. So it s worth taking a closer look.\nThe earliest blockchain, Bitcoin, and the first to use smart contracts, Ethereum, were based on proof-of-work technology. These first and second-generation blockchains both require a network of computers that compete to validate transactions and mine coins. The competition consists of solving an otherwise worthless puzzle so that the chance of success and earning the rewards involved depends solely on raw computational power. Ultimately, these blockchain validators compete by expending energy, which has led to massive levels of electricity use.\nMany people recognized the PoW problem early on and proof of stake was suggested in a bitcoin forum in 2011:\nI'm wondering whether a transition from a proof-of-work based system to a proof-of-stake one might happen. What I mean by proof of stake is that instead of your vote on the accepted transaction history being weighted by the share of computing resources you bring to the network, it's weighted by the number of bitcoins you can prove you own, using your private keys.\nA year later, Peercoin implemented a hybrid PoS-PoW protocol. But there were questions about whether PoS was secure. So teams of academics set out to design a PoS protocol that could be proven mathematically. It turned into quite a race, with a team led by Aggelos Kiayias, a professor at the University of Edinburgh and chief scientist at Input Output Global (IOG), submitting a groundbreaking paper about Ouroboros, the first blockchain protocol based on proof of stake with rigorous security guarantees , to the Crypto 2017 conference. It beat a team from Cornell University that introduced the Snow White protocol and described by the authors as a green consensus protocol because it used so much less energy than PoW blockchains. The Crypto conference applies a rigorous peer review process to include papers in the program. This involves other academics scrutinizing each paper for its scientific merits.\nProfessor Kiayias s paper established in a formal mathematical proof that the security properties of Ouroboros were comparable to those of Bitcoin. With 1,300 citations on Google Scholar, it is one of the most referenced research papers about blockchain, and has influenced several other systems, most notably Polkadot and Concordium.\nOnce the theory had been proven, IOG s blockchain engineers set about implementing the Ouroboros protocol in the Haskell programming language. Cardano was launched in September 2017 and ada, Cardano s native cryptocurrency that fuels the blockchain, immediately became a leading cryptocurrency one of only four coins that has held on to a top 10 position since.\nOf course, that 2017 launch was just the start of Cardano s journey, as set out in its four-era roadmap. IOG s engineers rejected the Silicon Valley model of go fast and break things , because failures of critical infrastructure affect people s lives. Slow and steady is the Cardano way.\nCardano relies on Ouroboros with its mathematically proven PoS consensus mechanism. Stake, a virtual resource, is recorded on the Cardano blockchain and delegation of that stake by ada holders is what keeps the network running and secure.\nRather than every ada holder having to run a computer system to take part in the staking process, it makes sense to share resources in stake pools. However, it is vital that the system prevents any pool becoming dominant. So Cardano has a reward-sharing scheme that incentivizes stake pools to develop in a way that ensures fairness. At the same time, the system makes it possible for stakeholders to delegate to a stake pool, or set up their own pool. In the latter case, pool operators pledge their stake. This is a commitment to lock up a certain amount of stake to help safeguard the network.\nMaking the process easy to use is important because the more stakeholders are engaged in the system, the more secure the distributed ledger. Most ada holders will not want to run a pool. Instead, they delegate their stake to one or more pools that, in their opinion, best serve their interests and the interest of the community at large. Cardano is non-custodial, so no funds are locked up at any time, and all stakeholders are encouraged to delegate their ada stake from their wallets.\nDominance is avoided by limiting the control of individual stakeholders. Stake pool operators exert an influence in the system proportional to the resources controlled by their pool, and not to their own resources. The higher the control by one individual of the system, the worse its security, leading to the possibility of a 51 attack to control the blockchain. Another danger is of stakeholders creating many pools, which can also lead to increased leverage and even a Sybil attack.\nProfessor Kiayias has described how the mechanism at the heart of Ouroboros behaves, both in blog posts and in the ground-breaking academic paper that proved the security of the Ouroboros.\nThe Ouroboros mechanism provides the right set of constraints for the system to converge to a certain number of equally-sized pools. Operators are rewarded appropriately for their performance, their cost efficiency, and their general contributions to the ecosystem.\nThe rewards-sharing scheme ensures that smaller and medium pools can contribute to the ecosystem without becoming gobbled up into larger operators and consortia, as has happened with other blockchain systems, particularly Bitcoin. The scheme is also designed so that as soon as stake delegated to a single pool increases above a certain threshold, the rewards diminish. That encourages ada holders to switch to a different pool to improve their rewards, which in turn bolsters the spread of stake across a larger number of pools. The network is more secure through a larger number of participants validating transactions.\nAt the end of each epoch a measure of time used by Ouroboros, lasting about five days rewards are distributed. As well as stake pool operating costs, earnings are transferred automatically to each stakeholder s private wallet by the Ouroboros protocol itself, not the stake pool.\nOne term you may have come across is liquid staking . This refers to a problem with some other blockchains whereby the stake associated with a cryptocurrency is locked by the staking process so cannot be used for other purposes, such as voting. This is not a problem with Cardano; the stake is always liquid. Also, there is no lock in period before a stake becomes active or that might delay a coin being spent or used in any other way.\nAs well as deciding on an amount to pledge, stake pool operators have to set out their profit margin and operational costs. At the end of each epoch, rewards are distributed to the stake pools. The rewards are distributed to the pool and the stakeholders in three stages. First, operational costs are automatically retained by the operator, ensuring that stake pools remain viable. Second, the operator s profit is calculated and withheld by the pool. Finally, all the ada holders who have delegated to the pool are rewarded in ada, the amount being proportional to their stake.\nProfessor Kiayias suggests that ada holders think of delegation as a vote of confidence a way to show support for a pool's mission or goals. Ada owners should use tools like adapools.org and pooltool.io to investigate factors that might influence their staking decision. These might include a pool s culture, ranking, resources, community presence, professionalism, and long-term commitment to the Cardano ecosystem. Watch out for news of improvements to the ranking mechanism in the Daedalus wallet interface, for example. Finally, check the pool s performance and updates regularly to ensure that your choice and assessment remains the best possible.\nNothing in this article is intended to be professional advice, including without limitation, financial, investment, legal or tax advice.

    "prompt": "Upgrading to Vasil key development takeaways?",
    "completion": "Artano is a community-driven non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace focused on revolutionizing the digital art economy. It seeks to connect vibrant global communities of artists and institutional clients with collectors around the world. Built on the Cardano blockchain, Artano enables the creation and trade of NFTs, as well as support for auctions, which only a few platforms on Cardano can offer.\nCardano is approaching its major upgrade to Vasil functionality. Like many other projects, Artano is in the process of upgrading both the platform and smart contract functionality to benefit from increased robustness, cost-efficiency, and scalability.\nOver the past few months, we have been testing Plutus V2 scripts and new Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) that will be introduced with the Vasil upgrade. In this post, we share the key development takeaways we ve learned while upgrading the platform and preparing it for a smooth transition to Vasil on mainnet.\nCurrently, Cardano is running on the Alonzo mainnet smart-contract functionality introduced in September 2021. Vasil, which will bring significant performance and capability enhancements to Cardano, introduces a new development era referred to as Babbage.\nUpgrading decentralized applications (DApps) to be compatible with Babbage functionality might not be as straightforward as it seems at a first glance. Upgrades introduce new ledger capabilities and this means that platforms, projects, and applications also need to adjust and prepare for such changes.\nArtano runs on a Cardano node at its core. In the process of upgrading to Vasil, we needed to upgrade from node v.1.34.1 to v.1.35.3, which is the recommended version for the mainnet hard fork. The platform also depends on the Cardano API rather than the Cardano CLI for the backend processing, and this requires a number of changes.\nIn preparation for the hard fork, both the Cardano node and the CLI need to be upgraded to the recommended version of the node (v.1.35.3). This comes with a number of changes required for Plutus contract support. An important thing for DApps to note is that when migrating from Plutus V1 scripts to Plutus V2 scripts, the source code, when recompiled, will not have the same script hash and address as a compiled V1 script. Using the exact same script with different language versions will result in different hashes. For more details, see the Plutus script addresses overview.\nFor a marketplace like ours, it is important to ensure that the NFTs that were put on sale before the node upgrade can still be purchased after the upgrade. This implies that correct contract addresses and redeemers are used in buying and withdrawing the NFTs.\nAfter the hard fork, the era will change to Babbage, and the scripts that still reference the Alonzo era will not work anymore. Therefore, it is crucial to update the scripts to use proper era parameters and data structures, which will also enable the trade and withdrawal of NFTs that were put on sale before the hard fork.\nYou can see some of the required changes listed in this Alonzo to Babbage migration guide.\nOnce the ledger is hard forked to Vasil functionality and the transition is complete, we can finally upgrade the contracts to support such Vasil capabilities as inline datums, reference scripts, and reference inputs. The benefits of these new capabilities would differ depending on the use case. For Artano, Vasil features provide significant benefits in reducing the transaction size and market operations fees (ie NFT buying and bidding).\nThe table below summarizes the improvements:\n*The results are gained from currently deployed mainnet using the node v.1.34.1. **The results are gained from testing Vasil functionality on the preview testnet using the node v.1.35.3.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Research overview part 3 tokens, stablecoins, and fees?",
    "completion": "Our previous post discussed Cardano s innovative EUTXO model and how it facilitates expressive smart contracts on Cardano. This time, we take a closer look at the research that enabled multi-asset support and the creation of a variety of user-defined tokens, and we also discuss the benefits of Babel fees.\nEthereum is known for providing the ability to create various user-defined assets (tokens). However, Ethereum s token standards are not directly supported by the ledger and require repetitive custom code. This adds a layer of complexity, extra cost, and inefficiency since token code is replicated and adapted rather than being part of the system itself. This leaves room for human error and can introduce bugs potentially leading to financial losses.\nThe research paper UTXOma: UTXO with Multi-Asset Support was written by IOG scientists and presented at the ISoLA 2020 conference. The paper studies the creation of a wide range of user-defined tokens through the use of contract scripts called minting policies.\nThe paper explores an alternative design to user-defined asset creation based on Bitcoin-style UTXO ledgers. It proposes an extension of the UTXO model, where the accounting structure of a single cryptocurrency is replaced with a new structure that manages an unbounded number of user-defined, native tokens, called token bundles.\nIn this new model, token creation is controlled by minting policy scripts that, just like Bitcoin validator scripts, use a domain-specific language with bounded computational expressiveness. This favors Bitcoin s security and results in a lightweight and low cost approach to custom asset creation and transfer.\nThe Native Custom Tokens in the Extended UTXO Model paper suggests a generalization of the EUTXO model with native user-defined tokens. The paper explores the synergy between the native tokens from UTXOma with expressive smart contracts on the basis of a UTXO ledger as proposed by the EUTXO model. This results in more expressive minting policies and a direct mapping of versatile contracts based on state machines to the multi-asset EUTXO ledger. The paper formally establishes the correctness of this mapping.\nBesides custom tokens, IOG carried out research on the implementation of a stablecoin on Cardano. The Djed: A Formally Verified Crypto-Backed Pegged Algorithmic Stablecoin paper was published in 2021.\nThe paper introduces a stablecoin contract based on algorithmic design, which uses smart contracts to ensure price stabilization. This is a very useful feature for decentralized finance (DeFi) environments. Djed acts as an autonomous bank. It mints and burns stablecoins and reserve coins while keeping a reserve of base coins. The contract maintains the peg of stablecoins to a target price by buying and selling stablecoins, using the reserve, and charging fees, which accumulate in the reserve.\nDjed is currently being implemented by COTI.\nThe benefits of Cardano s multi-asset EUTXO model opened up another research avenue that led to Babel fees . Babel fees is a mechanism that will allow for transaction fees to be paid in coins other than ada on Cardano. The paper has been accepted for publication at ACNS 2022, which took place in June.\nBlockchain transactions require fees for their execution. To ensure network security, fees usually must be paid in the currency native to a chosen blockchain, like ada on Cardano, for example. However, allowing the fee to be paid in other valuable tokens that a user possesses improves the convenience of use and also benefits interoperability. IOG s research in the paper on Babel fees explains how this is possible.\nSeveral innovative features of Cardano, such as the EUTXO model and custom native assets are coming together to enable Babel fees. Cardano s multi-asset support allows for the creation of tokens treated as native on the ledger. This means that new user-defined tokens if only enough users consider them valuable can be used to pay transaction fees just like ada, Cardano s primary currency.\nManuel Chakravarty, Lambda scientist and Plutus architect at IOG says:\nCardano encourages special-interest communities to form around new custom tokens that these communities create themselves using Plutus. Members of these communities may possess plenty of liquidity in a custom token without holding much ada. To support such communities, we want them to be able to pay for the use of the network using their own tokens.\nSo when a user wishes to pay the transaction fee in tokens other than ada, they can make such an offer by way of a Babel fee transaction offering a custom token, but incurring an ada liability. A block producer that validates this transaction can then accept this offer setting up a spot trade between ada and the offered token(s) at a previously advertised exchange rate. The block producer then creates a second transaction, covering the fee in ada, while receiving the offered tokens in exchange. By suitably extending the ledger rules, the transaction with the liability - as well as its matching transaction - become admissible to the ledger as a group. The beauty of the scheme is that users who stake their ada still get the staking reward paid out in ada as usual.\nManuel Chakravarty adds:\nThe next step towards the implementation of Babel fees on Cardano is to write a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) on the basis of the research paper. We will present this to the community for discussion as soon as the first version is complete.\nWith multi-asset and smart contract support introduced to Cardano in 2020-2021, the ledger became a functional environment for the creation of myriad decentralized applications (DApps). Now with over a thousand projects building on Cardano, IOG research and development is focused on Cardano s scaling and steady optimizations. So, in the next blog post, we ll reflect more on the research driving Cardano s scalability and interoperability.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "An analysis of the research underpinning Cardanos scalability?",
    "completion": "Before you start, read:\nPrevious blog posts delved into the foundational research that enabled Cardano s multi-functional ledger support for expressive smart contracts and native assets.\nAs part of the Basho development phase, Cardano is undergoing steady upgrades and optimizations for increased scalability and interoperability. The How we are scaling Cardano in 2022 post reflected on Cardano s scalability goals, and also discussed interoperability and the role of sidechains. This new post takes a closer look at the research that will enable these gradual enhancements.\nScalability is essential for a blockchain network to support an expanding user base, and ensure growth without sacrificing throughput.\nScaling a blockchain usually requires a combined approach with a diversity of solutions to suit every situation and project. For example:\nPipelining and input endorsers are two on-chain solutions planned to be implemented on Cardano. The paper detailing the research done on pipelining is not yet published, but here are some of the properties and rationale for the introduction of pipelining.\nPipelining in Ouroboros\nTo understand what pipelining is, let s first define the term block propagation. Block propagation means that block-producing nodes distribute information about new blocks across the network.\nPipelining improves block propagation times. The goal is for blocks to be propagated to peers within five seconds. Pipelining enables this by giving nodes the ability to pre-notify their downstream peers of an incoming block, enabling the peer to pre-fetch the new block body.\nThe research presents an idea to propagate block bodies before having fully validated them. This takes the block body validation work out of the critical path of block propagation and allows for the time spent on validation to be overlapped with sending the block to the next peer in the network. This reduces block propagation time, which further allows for block size increase or Plutus improvements among others. Consequently, the bigger the block, the more transactions and Plutus scripts it can carry, which also influences the blockchain s throughput. These upgrades are planned to be applied to Cardano during Vasil hard fork event.\nInput endorsers\nImplementation of input endorsers will also improve block propagation times and throughput. Input endorsers keep track of all submitted transactions and bundle these transactions into pre-constructed blocks. This means there are two sets of blocks, ones that contain the transactions and ones that achieve consensus. The blocks performing consensus will reference the pre-constructed blocks, which are constantly streamed without having to wait for consensus to be achieved. This will improve the consistency of block propagation times and allow higher transaction rates.\nJohn Woods, the former Director of Cardano Architecture at IOG, said:\nPipelining implementation is just great technology. Synthetic benchmarks show up to 40 efficiency gains. It's a great part of the story of how Cardano scales to meet demand. Cardano will soon see the dawn of Ouroboros Leios (input endorsers), which will be a game-changer. It is expected that input endorsers are going to scale Cardano for the next half decade.\nTiered pricing\nAnother research initiative by IOG scientists is the implementation of tiered pricing. In the current system, all transactions are treated the same without the possibility to alter their priority by paying higher gas fees, for example. This approach works well as long as the network throughput is comparable to transaction processing demand. However, as the network usage increases, not all the transactions might be eventually included in the blockchain. The possibility of a denial of service (DoS) attack taking advantage of the fair transaction treatment to pass off malicious spam as legitimate transactions requires additional measures to support network healthiness.\nTiered pricing enables steady system performance in an agile way, and is especially relevant in preventing DoS attacks. The research proposes to maintain predictability, fairness, and cost-efficiency of Cardano transactions while mitigating the issues that could arise from greater network demand. The approach puts forth a novel transaction fee mechanism, where each block is partitioned into three tiers (based on the use case). Each tier makes up a set percentage of the maximum block size and is designed for different types of transactions fair, balanced, and immediate. When the network is not busy, tiers default to the standard way of transaction prioritization.\nTo help scale the number of transactions that can be processed at once, a blockchain network can spin up a number of sidechains, introduce state channels, or apply a stake-based threshold multi-signature scheme, for example.\nSidechains\nThe Proof-of-Stake Sidechains paper was published in 2019. This paper provides the first formal definition of what a sidechain system is and how assets can be securely moved between sidechains.\nIOG scientists put forth a security definition that augments the known transaction ledger properties of persistence and liveness to hold across multiple ledgers, and enhances them with a new firewall security property. This safeguards each blockchain from its sidechains, limiting the impact of a potentially catastrophic sidechain failure. The paper also provides a sidechain construction that is suitable for proof-of-stake sidechain systems and is consistent with the Ouroboros consensus protocol. Such techniques as merged staking, cross-chain certification, and multi-signature usage are presented to ensure sidechains resilience to malicious attacks.\nAs a result of this research, IOG has developed the Cardano EVM sidechain toolkit for developing custom sidechains on Cardano. The EVM sidechain proof of concept public testnet is now available for testing. The testnet is compatible with Ethereum s tools and libraries, allowing developers to create Solidity smart contracts, DApps, and ERC20 tokens on Cardano test environments to gain from such benefits as cost-efficiency, scalability, and security.\nHydra\nBesides sidechains, there are other solutions for improving network scalability. Hydra state channels, for example.\nThe research paper Hydra: Fast Isomorphic State Channels was published in 2021. The paper introduces Hydra an isomorphic multi-party state channel. State channels are an attractive layer 2 solution for improving the throughput and latency of blockchains. Hydra simplifies off-chain protocol and smart contract development by directly adopting the layer 1 smart contract system, in this way allowing the same code to be used both on- and off-chain. Taking advantage of the EUTXO model, the research suggests how to develop a fast off-chain protocol for the evolution of Hydra Heads, whose protocol is currently being implemented on Cardano.\nYou can track Hydra development progress here.\nMithril\nFinally, to achieve greater scalability, it is also important to streamline the speed and efficiency of data synchronization between applications. Addressing this, the IOG research team published the paper on Mithril: Stake-based Threshold Multisignatures in 2021.\nEfficient chain validation is essential to achieve greater scalability in a blockchain setting. This also depends on various messages signed by network validators. Mithril addresses the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of these participants. Given the time it takes to validate a particular message, and the resource usage during the validation phase of chain synchronization, Mithril provides a solution that makes multi-signature aggregation fast and efficient without compromising security features.\nThe paper reflects on how to retain strong security settings in multi-signature aggregation. As a result, Mithril can be applied for fast, efficient, and secure chain synchronization protocol. It is advantageous for secure voting, data exchange between sidechains, and data synchronization within light wallets. It is part of the Basho phase and is currently being implemented on Cardano.\nYou can track Mithril development progress here.\nThere are currently 174 papers hosted in the IOG research library and this number is constantly growing.

Over five development phases, IOG introduced innovations, new functionality, and novel features, with each phase building upon the previous phase's achievements\nIntroduction\nChapter 1. Byron: the foundation of Cardano\nChapter 2. Shelley: decentralizing the blockchain\nWhile Cardano Shelley provided a greater level of system decentralization, Goguen development focused on the establishment of a global, financial and multi-functional system for decentralized application (DApp) building, smart contract support, and custom token issuance.\nThe Goguen development theme is named after Joseph Goguen a computer scientist specializing in the philosophy of computation and information who worked on the earliest approaches to the algebraic characterization of abstract data types. He was also involved in formal methods and theorem proving, the techniques which IOG implements while building Cardano s solid foundation of peer-reviewed research and high-assurance development.\nGoguen established a versatile platform to build solutions around such application domains as supply chain, track & trace, finance, medical records, identity voting, property registration, peer-to-peer payments, and many others. With its functionality, Goguen set initial enablers for turning Cardano into a more interoperable and scalable platform satisfying business needs.\nThe introduction of the multi-asset (MA) support extended the functionality of Cardano by enabling users to define, create or destroy, and exchange their own natively-supported tokens on Cardano. With MA support, the Cardano accounting ledger allowed the handling of custom tokens with no need for smart contracts, which significantly streamlined operation processing and simplified token movement. Another benefit was the easier integration of smart contracts and DApps involving multiple cryptocurrencies.\nPlutus application development is another significant feature within Goguen. Plutus applications are built on top of the Plutus platform a purpose-built smart contract development and execution platform utilizing Haskell. The use of Haskell allows developers to build secure and reliable applications with straightforward, concise, and reusable code that grants the highest level of security and efficiency of use.\nGoguen also opens Cardano up to wider audiences via Marlowe, allowing financial and business experts with no previous technical knowledge to create smart contracts. Marlowe is a high-level, domain-specific language (DSL) that allows building contracts both visually and through coding. Financial institutions can use Marlowe to develop and deploy custom instruments for their customers and clients. Marlowe comes with the Marlowe Playground, which enables development, simulation, and testing of the process of writing smart contracts in a sandbox environment.\nThe implementation of such functionality as token locking, multi-asset, and smart contract support made Cardano a multi-functional platform for DApp development.\nThe combination of Plutus and Marlowe enables a new class of enterprise-level smart contracts with verified functionality, capable of underpinning large-scale implementations in the real world. This is a step change in the abilities of Cardano, opening the way to the development of mission-critical, decentralized smart contract applications, with even more exciting things to come during Basho and Voltaire.\nFurther reading:\nChapter 4.

Byron: the foundation of Cardano\nChapter 2. Shelley: decentralizing the blockchain\nChapter 3. Goguen: introducing native tokens and smart contracts\nBasho is Cardano's development theme focused on network optimization, scalability, and interoperability. With the core functionality in place, Basho is about improving the underlying performance of the Cardano network to better support growth and adoption for thousands of applications with high transaction volumes.\nDuring Basho, IOG aims to steadily increase the capacity and throughput of the Cardano ledger by deploying new layer 1 and layer 2 solutions. These solutions include such on-chain improvements as block size increase, on-chain storage, diffusion pipelining, Plutus memory and speed enhancements, as well as an improved cost model. Off-chain solutions include Hydra Heads to maximize throughput and cost efficiency of transaction processing, and Mithril, which improves chain synchronization times for full and light node clients.\nBasho is also heavily focused on interoperability using solutions like sidechains and cross-chain bridges, which enable bidirectional communication with other blockchain systems. The upcoming launch of the sidechains toolkit will allow developers to bootstrap their own sidechains to benefit from Cardano s first-in-class security, cost efficiency, and environmentally-friendly impact. Sidechains enable value transfer between blockchains that may operate under different rules or consensus mechanisms. The result will be greater interoperability for Cardano and the ability to support new kinds of use cases on the network.\nIOG together with ecosystem partners have also carried out research on the Djed stablecoin. Djed is an algorithmic stablecoin with proven price stability, which is accomplished due to the use of formal methods. Stablecoin s algorithmic design provides enhanced security settings and eliminates price volatility. Djed is being implemented by COTI.\nIOG also created a UTXO alliance by partnering with other UTXO-based blockchains to cultivate innovative solutions and advance interoperability, programmability, and scalability. The UTXO alliance facilitates cross-ecosystem initiatives to extend the capabilities of UTXO, and to foster further research, development, and education across the entire blockchain space.\nBasho will see Cardano become one of the most high-performant, resilient, and flexible blockchain platforms in the industry. This will provide network infrastructure with the capability to scale in a sustainable, secure way, as well as the ability to add new functionality without compromising the reliability at the core of the network.\nFurther reading:\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

Byron: the foundation of Cardano\nChapter 2. Shelley: decentralizing the blockchain\nChapter 3. Goguen: introducing native tokens and smart contracts\nChapter 4. Basho: scaling Cardano\nDecentralized governance and decision-making lie at the heart of Voltaire. Voltaire provides the Cardano community with the ability to decide on network development updates, technical improvements, and project funding. For the Cardano network to become truly decentralized, it requires not only the distributed infrastructure introduced during Shelley, but also the capacity to be maintained and improved over time in a decentralized way.\nVoltaire focuses on the implementation of the final components required for the Cardano network to become a self-sustainable system. The introduction of a treasury system is one such component designed to ensure a continuous and self-sustaining source for funding Cardano improvements. The treasury is replenished every epoch from a portion of stake pool rewards, minted coins, and the percentage from fees. To enable fair decision making on how these funds should be used, Voltaire also introduces the decentralized software updates process. This allows ada holders to participate in decision making and take an active part in voting to influence system advancements.\nThis work is in progress and IOG has already started implementing social experiments and designing the engineering tools for these needs. Cardano improvement proposals (CIPs), for instance, are deployed within Voltaire as a social communication system that acts as an open-source library with resources describing formal, technically-oriented standards, code, and processes that provide guidelines for the Cardano community in a transparent and open-source way.\nAnother major step towards decentralized governance was the launch of Project Catalyst, which underpins the treasury system functionality, combining proposal and voting procedures. Project Catalyst maintains the source of funding for supporting initiatives and improvements proposed by ada holders, while simultaneously rewarding and incentivizing people who dedicate their time and effort to making productive decisions.\nVoltaire is about extension and development of concepts, tools, and experiments, driving a fully decentralized ecosystem to democratize the Cardano network. With all the components in place, Cardano becomes a truly decentralized platform no longer under the founding entities.\nWith the final Voltaire deliverables, Cardano s future will be in the hands of the community, who will have everything they need to grow and evolve Cardano from the secure, decentralized basis established by IOG.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

PPBL 2024 is the 5th iteration of the course, and we are excited to share the latest product of our years of tinkering, reading documentation, reviewing Discord conversations, and most importantly, learning together.\nWe built PPBL because we are, as Hinson (Wong, SIDAN Lab co-founder and Gimbalabs contributor) says, adoption maxis . Our goal is to teach people how to build novel applications that solve real problems, and that will drive meaningful adoption of Cardano.\nWe provide PPBL for free because it s the right thing to do but also because it serves some of our other goals! Through PPBL, we create spaces where collaboration can flourish. By working through the course, people have the chance to meet each other, get help, and build trust that leads to more substantial partnerships. This is how Gimbalabs built a track-record of supporting new projects throughout the Cardano ecosystem.\nhttps://plutuspbl.io/\nPPBL 2024 is somewhere in between a technical course for non-technical people and a non-technical course for technical people.\nIf you re a developer, PPBL 2024 will give you an overview of the architecture of Cardano applications, and provides a survey of options for each part of the Cardano development stack. Throughout the course, we provide links to deeper courses like the upcoming Mesh PBL, Cardano Go PBL, and Aiken PBL, our first entries in a growing list of specialized technical courses.\nIf you re a founder or project manager, this course will help you build the most important mental models of how Cardano works. Even if you are not a developer , we want you to be able to reason about the design of a Cardano application, to know what s easy, what s hard, and what kinds of tooling is still in development, so that you can make realistic plans for bringing your ideas to life.\nIn all cases, we are here to learn by doing. We believe that this is the best way to learn anything. Every time we learn from hands-on experience, we develop practical skills alongside a deeper intuition of how new knowledge is connected. When we are actively participating in projects, we re more likely to bump into other people who are doing the same and this is where collaboration starts.\nTo accompany the PPBL 2024 course, Gimbalabs hosts a weekly PPBL Live Coding session, on Wednesdays from 1430 1600 UTC. All are welcome to ask questions about PPBL lessons, get help on projects, and meet up with our highly-engaged + big-hearted community.\nWe also host dedicated sessions for Cardano Go and Mesh. You can find all weekly Gimbalabs meetings on this calendar: https://plutuspbl.io/calendar\nThis is the 5th iteration of Plutus PBL. The first iteration launched in late-2021. In 2022, we tested versions 2 and 3 of PPBL by delivering it in Canvas LMS. In 2023 we built a prototype of a Cardano-native course platform and used it to deliver the 4th iteration, PPBL 2023 .\nFrom last year s prototype, there is now a full-scale platform called Andamio, and that s where you ll find PPBL 2024, the first of several courses that will roll out this year. The team building Andamio consists of alumni from all four prior iterations of PPBL. It s our proof case that learning together is a good first step in building a strong organization. This is an idea that we ll continue to explore in the months ahead.\nAs always, we recognize that Cardano development continues to evolve. This course will be updated continually, and will be outdated in time for the release of PPBL 2025!\nhttps://www.andamio.io/course/ppbl2024\nThe first module of Plutus PBL 2024 is live at andamio.io/course/ppbl2024.

    "prompt": "Ouroboros Genesis design update?",
    "completion": "Author: Nicholas Frisby Contributor: Neil Burgess\nOuroboros Genesis is a series of enhancements to the already robust Ouroboros protocol, with countermeasures to protect a network node when it is new or returning after an absence.\nOuroboros is the consensus protocol at the heart of the Cardano blockchain. Given the continuing development and increasing uptake of Cardano, Ouroboros has progressed along its planned upgrade path. Ouroboros Classic was the first provably secure proof-of-stake protocol. Ouroboros BFT was an interim solution that enabled the Byron update. Ouroboros Praos continued the development of Ouroboros Classic. Ouroboros' evolution will go a step further with Ouroboros Genesis, which is currently planned to be delivered by Q3 of 2024.\nThis article describes recent updates to the development and implementation of the Ouroboros Genesis protocol.\nA blockchain is a distributed ledger replicated across machines called nodes. Because there is no single central authority, a mechanism must exist to guarantee the consistency and immutability of all ledger copies. That mechanism is the consensus protocol. The protocol also sets incentives for the nodes to validate new blocks and add them to the chain.\nOuroboros divides Cardano's time into epochs, which are subdivided into slots. Slots represent short time periods when blocks can be created.\nOuroboros Classic is proven secure when most of the nodes are online and have consistent copies of the ledger. Adversaries could not predict which node would be the next slot leader (the node that gets to add a block to the chain), making attacks very expensive.\nOuroboros Praos increased the randomness in selecting the next slot leader, and added countermeasures for other possible attacks.\nOuroboros Genesis will address the situation where a node first joins the network (starting from the genesis block), or rejoins after a prolonged absence. Such nodes are in a vulnerable situation until they catch up. For example, a long-range attack occurs when an adversary attempts to rewrite the history of the chain. The adversary accumulates a large stake, to allow them to secretly create blocks faster than the main chain. Then, when the alternate historical chain is ready, the adversary attempts to switch the main chain to the adversary's chain. The Genesis implementation will mitigate long-range attacks, unless the syncing node becomes eclipsed. An eclipse attack occurs when the adversary attempts to surround the victim node with malicious peers, obscuring the real network.\nGenesis introduces the following new concepts:\nledger peers\nlightweight checkpointing (as a temporary fallback/override)\nlimit on eagerness (LoE)\ngenesis density disconnections (GDD)\nlimit on patience (LoP)\nthe Genesis state machine.\nThe deepest departure from the Genesis paper was an early architectural decision to preserve the Praos node's limitation on rollback. Under Praos, a Cardano node will not rollback further than 2,160 blocks without manual intervention. As outlined in the Genesis paper, a node under eclipse attack could only select extensions of an adversarial chain for years and then, when it finally connects to a node serving the honest chain, abruptly rollback any number of blocks.\nBecause it is not necessary in practice for a node to have unlimited rollback capability, the architects instead prioritized the rollback limit, which is key to many bounds on resource usage. Dropping it for Genesis would remove a staple invariant invoked by a significant portion of the preceding engineering work. Moreover, as long as the syncing Cardano Genesis node has access to a healthy honest peer, it should, like the Praos node, not require a rollback of more than 2,160 blocks.\nEclipses are potentially a more significant threat to the Genesis node than expressed in the paper, which doesn't directly address them. These attacks endanger the Genesis safety property, since an eclipse lasting longer than a few seconds is enough for a syncing Genesis node to potentially select 2,161 blocks from an adversarial chain, despite faithfully implementing the Genesis density comparisons. Without knowledge of the honest chain, the Genesis rule will simply select the densest chain currently accessible. In an eclipse situation, that might not necessarily be the honest chain. This contrasts with the Genesis paper, in which an eclipsed node and its users are merely delayed, confused, misinformed, etc. That carries related risks, but does not compromise the safety or liveness properties, since the node could eventually connect an honest peer and therefore recover.\nConsidering only a Praos network, in which nodes theoretically never fall behind, eclipses can still be detrimental. The key difference with Genesis is that a Praos node (inherently caught up) can withstand a much longer eclipse before there's a significant probability that it might commit to an adversarial chain. However, even without considering the extra vulnerability during syncing, a Praos node does need some defense against eclipses.\nOne defense is to introduce the concept of ledger peers within the peer selection logic to sufficiently bound the probability and duration of eclipses. While syncing, a Genesis node adjusts its ledger peer configuration to drastically reduce the probability of becoming eclipsed. And without eclipses, the Genesis node will never select 2,161 blocks from an adversarial chain.\nThe changed peer selection works like this. By examining a recent stake distribution, a Genesis node selects sample peers that have participated in maintaining the network, greatly reducing the probability of selecting malicious nodes.\nThe Genesis paper establishes that the best chain within a healthy Praos network will have more blocks than any other chain in a fixed window of slots immediately after the two chains' intersection. The only exception is if the Praos network is not healthy.\nA severe network outage would justify executing a disaster recovery plan, one that requires off-chain cooperation among stakeholders to rewrite the chain within the outage's interval to repair the honest chain. After that happens, the Genesis rule would again favor the honest chain.\nHowever, a disaster recovery plan is inherently difficult and expensive to execute. At least in the meantime, a simple checkpointing mechanism would let a sufficiently large cooperating subset of vigilant stake pool operators quickly and easily maintain control of the network during or immediately after the block production outage.\nThe logic is simple and consistent with the rest of the protocol: a configuration file specifying a list of block number and hash pairs, each of which causes any other block with the same block number to be treated as invalid. That checkpoint s configuration data should be used with care and acquired only from trusted sources. Ideally, the recovery plan's eventual execution will permit (and even require) that reactive additions to the checkpoints list are temporary. The only permanent checkpoints will be the set that ensures the Byron era's genesis keys are no longer relevant to the Cardano chain.\nSince ledger peers effectively prevent eclipses, a syncing node can assume that it has at least one healthy peer serving all of some honest chain. The safety property is therefore directly ensured by simply prohibiting the syncing Genesis node from ever selecting more than 2,160 blocks of a chain past the intersection of its ledger peers' chains. It will only select blocks that all ledger peers agree on, which almost certainly include an honest peer. This constraint is named limit on eagerness (LoE), because the syncing node must not eagerly commit to the best block it has seen so far. An adversarial peer may be able to serve its alternative blocks much faster than any honest peer can serve the historical blocks.\nIt's trivial for an adversary to abuse the LoE to cause the victim to stop syncing blocks, violating the syncing node's liveness property. There are three ways to do so:\nthe attacking peer claims it has no more blocks the attacking peer serves an alternative chain the attacking peer claims it has alternative blocks but also does not serve them.\nThe fundamental rule from the Genesis paper directly mitigates the first two. If two peers are serving different chains and at least one of the chains has no fewer than 2,161 blocks after the intersection, Genesis favors the chain that has more blocks in the fixed window of slots after the two chains intersection. (An honest chain will always win that comparison. Recall that a shared prefix reflects a chain intersection, even if one of the chains is simply the extension of another.) The Genesis node will favor the honest chain by disconnecting from the other peer. This action is known as a Genesis density disconnection (GDD). After enough GDDs, the remaining peers' intersection will be farther along the historical honest chain.\nThe third attack vector is the most difficult to analyze. The GDD is disabled since the peer is claiming to have more blocks. That is, it's claiming that its block count in that fixed window will increase if it is permitted more time to serve more blocks. An honest peer is always genuinely making that claim, until the syncing node indeed has all the honest blocks. But an attacking peer could make that claim in bad faith. The limit on patience (LoP) ensures that a peer claiming to have more blocks must actually send them, and do so promptly. The key complication is that even honest peers cannot maintain perfect responsiveness for hours on end, they will occasionally have latency bursts, etc. For this reason, the LoP is implemented as a leaky bucket for each peer, where the leakage is the rate of processing blocks while the peer has claimed blocks and is serving them slower than some generous minimal rate, but each honest peer's bucket capacity will be high enough to absorb bursts of latency typically expected from healthy ledger peers.\nThe Genesis node will disable LoE, GDD, and LoP once it concludes it is caught up, for two important reasons. First, a caught-up node in a Praos network fundamentally must mint the best block it can in a slot in which it's elected. For example, if such a node were still using the Genesis rules, a strong adversary could potentially abuse the LoE to temporarily prohibit the victim from selecting the block it just minted, thereby preventing it from propagating to the network. It's difficult to bound the system-wide fallout of such a vector, and so the Genesis node should behave exactly like a Praos node whenever it's not syncing.\nSecond, a caught-up node does not need as many peers as a syncing node, since it is not as vulnerable to eclipses. Therefore, the significant extra load on the network due to all nodes maintaining inflated ledger peer counts is unnecessary and undesirable. The Genesis state machine manages the node's transitions between considering itself caught up or not:\nWhen caught up, the node disables the LoE, GDD, and LoP. A node concludes it is caught up if these conditions are met:\nit has enough ledger peers\nall peers claim to have no additional blocks (which a well-tuned LoP ensures must happen soon enough)\nthe node has already selected the best of the peers chains. This is more robust than trusting the age of the local selection etc, since an attacking peer might be able to trigger such thresholds, causing the victim to prematurely lower its defenses.\nA node falls back to syncing if the tip of its chain is too old (eg, 20 minutes or so). Notably, this will happen during the lifetime of the node's operating system process if the machine sleeps for long enough (eg, a user closes their laptop lid for a while).\nThe above design has stabilized over the past year or so. While it's still evolving slightly, there have been no major changes. IOG has been collaborating with Tweag during the past several months to implement and test it.\nThe first Genesis-capable implementation is scheduled for release by Q3 of 2024. At this stage, the greatest remaining unknown is the degree of optimization necessary to compensate for the increased peer count required to prevent eclipses.\nUntil then, the imminent bootstrap peer design serves as an increment towards Genesis. The bootstrap state machine is a simpler variant of the Genesis state machine. While syncing, a node only communicates with bootstrap peers, every single one of which is trusted, and hence the LoE, GDD, and LoP are unnecessary. In contrast, Genesis will allow a syncing node to safely include untrustworthy peers, as long as it's not eclipsed (ie, as long as one peer is honest), which will permit retiring the bootstrap peers, thereby decentralizing the infrastructure for syncing nodes and fulfilling the promise of Ouroboros Genesis.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

However, how is this possible? How does each collaboration bring Cardano one step closer to its self-sustainability goals?\nThe subject of this post is one collaboration in particular: Blink Labs and TxPipe. But first, by way of context, some famous collaborations that have pushed the boundaries of what is possible in a variety of industries:\nCreative Commons license\nHewlett-Packard garage exterior in Palo Alto, Silicon Valley. Creative Commons license\nCreative Commons license\nLe bureau d'Yves Saint Laurent. Creative Commons license\nCreative Commons license\nCreative Commons license\nHindsight is misleading, because it makes people think that there is something special about past events. However high-level and historical these collaborations may seem, their non-linear effect is not exclusive to them.\nSource: Taleb s Antifragility website by abdelazizalgh\nNassim Taleb, a renowned scholar and author, is widely recognized for his work on non-linearity. Taleb's insights into non-linear systems emphasize the inherent unpredictability and complexity of the world, challenging traditional linear thinking and forecasting methods. In this context, collaborations take on a new significance.\nSource: Taleb s Antifragility website by abdelazizalgh\nBy bringing together diverse perspectives, expertise, and resources, collaborations can help navigate the uncertainties and complexities of non-linear systems more effectively. They offer a platform for collective learning, adaptability, and resilience, enabling individuals and organizations to better anticipate, respond to, and capitalize on unexpected opportunities and challenges.\nThus, Taleb's ideas underscore the transformative potential of collaborations in an increasingly interconnected and unpredictable world.\nUTxO RPC is a collaborative project from TxPipe and Blink Labs that was funded in Project Catalyst Fund 11. It's an interface tailored for interactions with UTxO-based blockchains, prioritizing performance and developer experience.\nSource: UTxO RPC docs\nBy providing a common contract, a range of SDKs, and thorough documentation, UTxO RPC aims to facilitate:\nEnabling shared components that can be reused across different projects to simplify the integration effort.\nA common interface to simplify integrations between different parties and avoid the common pitfall of vendor lock-in.\nA serialized binary format which is compact and efficient, resulting in smaller message sizes and reduced network overhead compared to its JSON counterpart\nYou can read the Catalyst proposals that led to this project here:\ngRPC Cardano: A streaming API for Cardano using Dolos by TxPipe\nCardano Node API: a Cardano Node companion written in Go\nThis week at Cardano Go Live Coding, the Andamio platform team took their first look at what UTxO RPC will mean for the Cardano developer community: it's about a lot more than Go Development. It provides a common specificiation for how Go, Rust, Python, and JavaScript developers can build Cardano applications. This week's session was a great place for any developer to understand how.\nSource: UTxO RPC docs\nIn case you missed the previous Cardano Go Live Coding sessions, including the last one, in the Andamio Blog Cardano Go Live Coding Session #003 you can find all the updates, including the access link to the next one (every monday, 13:00 - 14:00 utc).\nAt Gimbalabs, we are excited to make sure that UTxO RPC services and many others from other builders are accessible. The variety of data providers coming online right now, and the variety of ways these services can be deployed and shared, gives us confidence that the Cardano ecosystem will be build applications on robust, reliable, and distributed foundations. We will surely be playing with the UTxO RPC interface in our next Gimbalabs Playground and Gimbalabs Open Spaces sessions.\nDid you notice in one of the images above the following?\nSource: UTxO RPC docs\nIn Cardano's best projects there is always an open door for new contributors. The best startups in the ecosystem know that making their projects a thriving endeavor that cultivates a community of dedicated contributors and encourages engaging interactions is key to making them vibrant projects that accelerate their de-commit rate sooner than expected.\nSource: Andamio\nThe Andamio platform cuts through the noise and serves the essential know-how of your organization, so that potential contributors know exactly where to start and how to proceed.

    "prompt": "Actus smart contracts in Marlowe?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nProf Simon Thompson - Technical Project Director\nOriginally published on IOG.io: October 13, 2020\nSummary:\nWriting in the language of finance, rather than the language of blockchain\nArticle:\nIn our Developer Deep Dive series of occasional technical blogs, we invite IOHK s researchers and engineers to discuss their latest work and insights.\nMarlowe is a domain-specific language for secure financial smart contracts that is being developed by IOHK for the Goguen capabilities of the Cardano blockchain. Following my introductory post on Marlowe, in this Deep Dive post, we'll look at the details of the language, and the various ways of writing Marlowe smart contracts as we move into the era of decentralized finance (DeFi). After explaining our approach to oracles, which import real world information into a running contract, we look at the Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard (Actus) for financial contracts and explain how we have implemented this innovation in Marlowe.\nMarlowe is a small language, with a handful of constructs that, for each contract, describe behavior involving a fixed, finite set of roles.\nA running contract can make a payment to a role or a public key.\nIn a complementary way, a contract can wait for an action by one of the roles, such as a deposit of currency, or a choice from a set of options. Crucially, a contract cannot wait indefinitely: if no action has been initiated by a given time (the timeout), then the contract will continue with another behavior, such as refunding any funds in the contract.\nDepending on the current state of a contract, it may make a choice between two future courses of action, which are themselves contracts.\nWhen no more actions are required, the contract will close, and any remaining currency in the contract will be refunded.\nWhen a contract is run, the roles it involves are fulfilled by participants, which are identities on the blockchain. This model allows a role to be transferred during contract execution so that roles in a running contract can be traded. Each role is represented by a token on the chain, and transferring this transfers the ability to perform the role s actions. Taking this further, we can represent a single role with multiple tokens, thus allowing the role to be shared: this could be termed being securitized .\nWe deliberately chose to make the language as simple as we can, so that it is straightforward to implement on Cardano and in the Marlowe Playground. Marlowe describes the flow of cryptocurrencies between participants, and for this to be implemented in practice on the Cardano blockchain, code has to be executed both on-chain and off-chain: remember, though, that just one Marlowe contract describes both parts. The on-chain part accepts and validates transactions that conform to the requirements of the smart contract: this part is implemented as a single Plutus script for all Marlowe contracts, with the particular Marlowe contract comprising a datum passed through the transactions. Off-chain, the Marlowe contract will be presented via the user interface and wallet, offering or, indeed, automating deposits and choices and receiving cryptocurrency payments.\nFigure 1. Marlowe Playground simulates the ways that contracts behave\nIn the Playground, we re able to simulate contract behavior, so that potential users can walk through different ways that contracts will evolve, according to different actions taken by the participants. In the main simulation, Figure 1, users have an omniscient point of view and are able to perform actions by any participant, with the option at each point to undo the actions taken, and then to take a different path. The wallet simulation allows users to see behavior from one particular participant s perspective, thus simulating how that user will interact with the running contract once it is deployed on the blockchain.\nThis simplicity also makes it possible for us to model Marlowe contracts in an SMT solver, a logic system for automatically checking the properties of systems. Using this model, which we call static analysis, for each contract we are able to check whether or not it might fail to fulfill a payment, and if the contract can fail we get evidence of how it fails, helping the author to rewrite the contract if they wish.\nWe can build a formal model of our implementation in a proof assistant, in which we are able to produce machine-checked proofs of how the language behaves. While the SMT solver works for individual contracts, the proof assistant can prove the properties of contract templates, as well as the system itself: for instance, we can show that in any running contract, the accounts it references can never be in debit. Simulation, static analysis, and proof provide complementary levels of assurance for a contract to which users will be committing assets to ensure that the contract behaves as it should.\nWe have seen how Marlowe contracts can be analyzed in various ways, but how do authors actually write smart contracts in Marlowe? The Playground provides several ways of producing Marlowe contracts. Users can write Marlowe directly, but beginners often choose to build contracts visually, using an interactive Blockly editor. Figure 2 shows a section of an escrow contract.\nFigure 2. An escrow contract in Playground s interactive Blockly editor\nWorking in this visual editor has the advantage of showing all the options as you select how to fill in a part of the contract that is being developed. Alternatively, you can develop contracts in Haskell, because the Marlowe DSL is in fact embedded in Haskell. Figure 3 shows the same contract in Haskell: the blue and purple parts are Marlowe, and the black components are defined in Haskell, as abbreviations that make the overall contract more readable. This approach allows users to build up a smart contract step by step from components. In the code shown in Figure 3, the roles, Alice and Bob, are each asked to make a choice: if their choices match, they agree, and the contract proceeds one way; if not, then a third participant, Carol, is asked to arbitrate between them. The contracts agreement and arbitrate are defined later in the Haskell file.\nFigure 3. The escrow contract in Haskell\nUsers will also be able to write their financial smart contracts using JavaScript, while still enjoying all the advantages of analysis, simulation, and proof, as provided by the Marlowe implementation.\nOne of the first questions we get asked when we describe Marlowe is about financial oracles, or how we can get a contract to take account of external data values, such as the exchange rate between ada and bitcoin. Abstractly, an oracle is just like a participant that makes a choice, and so the semantics of Marlowe can already deal with external values. However, we plan to support oracle values as part of the implementation, allowing contracts to access values directly from a stock market ticker or a data feed such as Coinbase. At the same time, the Plutus team is researching the best way to deal with oracles in general, and we can expect support for that in due course, though maybe not in the first full release of Marlowe and the Plutus Application Framework.\nMarlowe has the potential to give people the chance to make financial commitments and trades without a third party facilitating it: the blockchain ensures that the contract is followed.\nWe are building a Marlowe implementation of disintermediated contracts to offer to end-users who want to make peer-to-peer financial deals directly without the intervention of any third parties.\nThe Actus Financial Research Foundation categorizes financial contracts by means of a taxonomy that is described in a detailed technical specification.\nActus builds on the understanding that financial contracts are legal agreements between two (or more) counterparties in the exchange of future cash flows. Historically, such legal agreements are described in natural language, leading to ambiguity and artificial diversity. As a response, Actus defines contracts by means of a set of contractual terms and deterministic functions mapping these terms to future payment obligations. Thereby, it is possible to describe most financial instruments through 31 contract types or modular templates.\nNext, we look at a simple example, and then we explain our full approach to implementing Actus, with complementary approaches providing different pros and cons.\nA zero-coupon bond is a debt security that does not pay interest (a coupon) but is issued at a discount, rendering profit at maturity when the bond is redeemed for its full face value.\nFor example, Figure 4 describes a contract whereby an investor can buy a bond that costs 1,000 lovelaces with a 15 discount. She pays 850 lovelaces to the bond issuer before the start time, here slot 10.\nLater, after the maturity date, slot 20 here, the investor can exchange the bond for its full notional value, ie, 1,000 lovelaces.\nFigure 4. Contract for a zero-coupon bond with a 15 discount\nThis contract has a significant drawback. Once the investor has deposited the 850 lovelaces, it will be immediately paid to the issuer; if the investor does not invest quickly enough, ie before the timeout, the contract ends. After that, two outcomes are possible:\nthe issuer deposits 1,000 lovelaces in the investor's account, and that sum is immediately paid to the investor in full;\nif the investor doesn t make the deposit, then the contract is closed and all the money in the contract is refunded, but there is no money in the contract at this point, so the investor loses her money.\nHow can we avoid this problem of the bond issuer defaulting? There are at least two ways to solve this: we could ask the issuer to deposit the full amount before the contract begins, but that would defeat the object of issuing the bond in the first place. More realistically, we could ask a third party to be a guarantor of the deal, as expressed here.\nFigure 5. Improved contract with a guarantor\nProducts in the Actus taxonomy, such as the principal at maturity contract, can be presented in different ways in Marlowe, according to the degree to which they can accept changes to their terms during the contract lifetime (Figure 6).\nFigure 6. Actus taxonomy and Marlowe\nIn the simplest case, all cash flows are set, or frozen, at contract initiation, so that it is entirely predictable how the contract will operate, assuming that all participants continue to engage with the contract during its lifetime. Contracts of this kind we call Actus-F (for fixed or frozen).\nDynamism that is change during contract evolution can happen in two ways. Participants can make unscheduled payments that require re-calculation of the remaining cash flows, and also the cash flows can be modified by taking into account external risk factors. The full generality of contracts that do both is modeled in Actus-M (for Marlowe).\nThere are intermediate levels too: Actus-FS models fixed schedules: allowing risk factors to be taken into account, but with no unexpected payments; conversely, Actus-FR contracts allow payments to be made at unexpected points, but do not take into account any risk factors.\nFinally, moving outside Marlowe, Actus-H (H for Haskell) models the contracts directly as programs in Plutus or Haskell, using Marlowe for validation of each transaction in the contract lifetime by generating Plutus code from the Marlowe description of the contract logic.\nWhy do we offer these different models of Actus contracts? The reason is that there is a trade-off between the dynamic nature of contracts and the assurance we can give to users about how the contracts will perform in advance of contract execution.\nActus-F contracts present an entirely fixed schedule of payments, which can be scrutinized directly by the participants so that it is straightforward to see, for example, that all payments from such a contract will succeed.\nActus-FS and -FR contracts present more dynamism, but the contracts are readable and easy to scrutinize. Moreover, they are subject to (slower) static analysis to establish, for example, that all payments will succeed.\nActus-M contracts are expressed in Marlowe, and so can be analyzed. Analysis is, however, substantially slower because of the unpredictability of the actions that the contract will undergo at any particular point in time. Note that assurance can be offered for scaled-down versions of contracts, which have the same computational content, but which evolve over a shorter time, thus involving fewer interactions.\nActus-H contracts are written in a combination of Plutus and Marlowe, and so are not amenable to static checking in the same way as the others. However, this platform offers corporate clients full extensibility and tailoring of the implementation of the Actus standard.\nIn our implementation of Actus, available as a pre-release version in the Labs tab of the Playground, users are able to generate Actus-F and -FS contracts from the terms of the contract, using a visual presentation of the data required.\nFigure 7. The three items with asterisks are required for a principal at maturity contract\nFor a principal at maturity contract, three items are required: the start and end date, and the notional amount of the contract (hence the items being starred in the template). Such a contract will comprise a simple load, in which the notional amount is transferred from the counterparty to the party at the start of the contract, and in the reverse direction at the maturity date.\nAdding additional items will change the generated contract accordingly. In Figure 7, the party will have to transfer the notional plus the premium to the counterparty at the maturity date, hence giving the counterparty an incentive to make the loan in the first place.\nAs we have seen, finance professionals and developers now have a way to start creating financial smart contracts directly in Haskell or pure Marlowe, or visually, using the Marlowe Playground, depending on their programming expertise. In the Playground, you can simulate and analyze the contracts you create to test that they work properly and are ready to be issued into the world of decentralized finance when the Goguen stage of Cardano is implemented. IOHK s Marlowe team will continue implementing examples from the Actus standard, as we prepare to finalize the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano and bring financial smart contracts to the blockchain itself.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

The testnet is live, and you can explore its features.\nJamOnBread's mission is to give the community a feature-packed, easy-to-use tool to interact with their NFTs. The team would like to attract people outside the Cardano ecosystem to join Cardano's NFT revolution and discover its advantages.\nThe team at JamOnBread has identified a significant issue in the NFT sector, where the majority of transactions are concentrated on a single platform regardless of who participated in the sale. Thus, fees are unfairly shared. They aim to revolutionize this with their unique smart contract.\nTheir smart contract introduces multiple on-chain affiliate levels and dynamically divides transaction fees based on several factors. These factors encompass the marketplace where the NFT was listed, the marketplace where the sale occurred, and the contributors involved in the NFT sale (affiliate link).\nThis differs from traditional smart contracts, where the entire transaction fee is received solely by the contract owner. Here s how a typical smart contract operates:\nUser A lists an NFT on Marketplace 1 using their smart contract. Marketplace 2 can display all NFT listings from Marketplace 1's smart contract on their platform. When User B purchases the NFT on Marketplace 2, the entire transaction fee goes to Marketplace 1, as their smart contract handles the transaction.\nHowever, JamOnBread's smart contract operates differently:\nUser A lists an NFT Marketplace 1 using JamOnBread's smart contract. Marketplace 2 displays all NFT listings from JamOnBread's smart contract on their platform. When User B purchases the NFT from Marketplace 2, the transaction fee is dynamically and fairly divided between Marketplace 1 and Marketplace 2, rewarding both for their contributions to the NFT sale. This approach ensures a more equitable distribution of transaction fees.\nDo not hesistate to try the new NFT marketplace on the testnet.\nThe procedure is simple and similar to other DApps.\nIn the settings of your Cardano wallet, you need to switch from mainnet mode to preprod testnet mode.\nGo to testnet faucet, enter your testnet address and claim testnet ADA (tADA).\nThen go to the Discord of the JamOnBread project and claim testnet NFTs. Alternatively, you can buy NFTs on the marketplace with tADA. Follow JamOnBread twitter.\nYou can list & buy testnet NFTs and try the new revenue sharing via an on-chain affiliate program.\nFeel free to share your experience with the team and give them feedback. You can suggest improvements or report bugs.\nThe team may reward active testers who help them by providing feedback & suggestions.\nHappy testing!\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Gimbalabs series Create, Deploy, and Manage your own Plutus contracts effectively Part 1?",
    "completion": "I can plan and implement my own Plutus contracts\nI can create, update and maintain a Plutus project.\nI understand how time works on Plutus (POSIXTime) and Ledger (Slot Number).\nIn this first part of the series, we will focus on the first SLT:\nFig 1. Gimbalabs Plutus PBL module 302: https://plutuspbl.io/modules/302/3021\nFig 1. Gimbalabs Plutus PBL module 302:\nBefore we delve into the intricacies of Plutus smart contracts, it's crucial to grasp the significance of meticulous planning. Imagine your smart contract as a blueprint for a building; the quality of the blueprint directly impacts the strength and stability of the structure. Similarly, your contract's planning phase sets the stage for its reliability and predictability.\nDeterminism\nInput Parameters\nDesigning the Logic\nState Management\nError Handling\nSecurity\nTo help illustrate Planning concepts, we will use 'Token Vesting' or 'Token Lockup' contracts as prime examples. These contracts play a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency and blockchain realm, especially during Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or token distribution events.\nConsider this example: You're launching a new cryptocurrency and want to distribute tokens to early investors and dev team. Instead of minting all tokens at once, holding them in a wallet and then releasing them, you create a Token Vesting contract to unlock a certain percentage of tokens at regular intervals.\nAll calculations inside Token Vesting contract related to the release of tokens should be deterministic. For example, if an investor is entitled to receive 10 of their tokens every month, the contract must calculate the exact number of tokens to release based on the current date consistently. Given the same inputs (current date, contract start date, token allocation), the contract should always produce the same result, ensuring predictability.\nIn a Token Vesting contract, critical parameters include the investor's address, the start date of the vesting period, the total token allocation, and the release schedule. These parameters must be defined clearly and deterministically. For instance, specifying the start date as a POSIXTime ensures that the contract's behavior is directly tied to a deterministic blockchain event, making it predictable for all parties involved.\nPOSIXTime\nThe logic of a Token Vesting contract should be precise and entirely deterministic. For instance, consider a scenario where an investor can claim tokens after 6 months, and they can claim the entire allocation at once. The contract's logic can be abstracted as follows:\nisTokenClaimPossible :: Bool isTokenClaimPossible = if from claimingTime `contains` txInfoValidRange then do payToPubKey investor totalTokenAmount else traceError \"Tokens are locked until the vesting period ends.\"\nisTokenClaimPossible :: Bool isTokenClaimPossible = if from claimingTime `contains` txInfoValidRange then do payToPubKey investor totalTokenAmount else traceError \"Tokens are locked until the vesting period ends.\"\nManaging the state of data is crucial in a Token Vesting contract. Plutus provides data structures like Datum and Redeemer to manage state and trigger actions. For instance, you might use the Datum to store information about the vested tokens and their release schedule. The contract's state management should be deterministic, ensuring that the data stored in Datum aligns with the contract's purpose and can be consistently evaluated.\nDatum\nRedeemer\nDatum\nDatum\nError handling is vital to ensure the contract behaves predictably, even in unexpected scenarios. Let's say an investor attempts to claim tokens before the vesting period is over. In this case, the contract should implement error handling to gracefully reject the transaction and return a deterministic 'False' outcome, indicating that the conditions for token release have not been met.\nSecurity is paramount when planning a Token Vesting contract. Consider potential vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access or reentrancy attacks. To maintain the contract's deterministic nature, you should implement robust security measures, including access control checks, input validation, and careful handling of funds. Security audits and thorough testing should be part of the planning process to mitigate potential risks effectively.\nSee the original lesson (including the video lesson) at: https://plutuspbl.io/modules/302/3021\nFollow Gimbalabs for further announcements.\nPlutus\nPlutus\nPlutus 'POSIXTime' 'Ledger' 'Slot Number'\nSLT\nFig 1.

    "prompt": "Programming languages?",
    "completion": "Cardano is written in Haskell, a functional language that emphasizes 'pure' functions. That is, functions that produce the same result for the same input.\nHaskell is particularly well suited to Cardano's high-assurance code, and the need for greater formal verification in the blockchain. Cardano aims to become a global social and financial system, which requires high reliability and verification.\nMany other companies use Haskell, both because of its security properties and pure functional nature. Well-known firms like Oracle and Facebook use Haskell for blockchain research and advertising, respectively, while lesser-known companies such as Atos IT and Jotron use it for building applications for the aerospace industry.\nPlutus is Cardano's native smart contract language. Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs.\nPlutus draws from modern language research to provide a safe, full-stack programming environment based on Haskell, the leading purely functional programming language. By using Plutus, users can be confident in correctly executing their smart contracts.\nRead about Plutus V3 and how it offers developers greater efficiency, optionality, and ease of use.\nMarlowe is a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing and executing financial contracts.\nMarlowe contracts are optimized for financial transactions and development platforms, and ensure a fast track for financial service providers to build expertise in smart contracts and blockchain technology.\nMarlowe provides a suite of products for the community that will foster the adoption of Cardano in finance. Marlowe creates a blockchain-specific way to replicate key processes within financial services by making smart contract development easier for developers in this industry.\nMarlowe also aims to facilitate new possibilities of financial innovation and aims to become the technology powering a host of smart contract-based financial services.\nAiken is a new programming language and toolchain for developing smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It draws inspiration from various modern languages, like Gleam, Rust, and Elm, renowned for their friendly error messages and an overall excellent developer experience.\nAs a language, Aiken is purely functional with static typing and type inference. This means most of the time, the compiler is smart enough to determine the type of something without requiring user annotation. It also allows the creation of custom types resembling records and enums. Aiken does not include higher-kinded types or type classes because it aims for simplicity.\nLearn more on the Aiken website.\nOpshin's syntax is 100 valid Python code, ensuring that contracts evaluate on-chain exactly as their Python counterpart. This makes opshin the main alternative for developers with Python experience looking to build on Cardano. Opshin interacts closely with the Python library, PyCardano, and supports both imperative and functional paradigms without compromising Cardano smart contracts' core design.\nDeveloped by Harmonic Labs, plu-ts is a Typescript-embedded programming language and library designed for on-chain smart contract code efficiency while staying as close as possible to the Typescript syntax.\nPlu-ts implementation provides tools to write off-chain code, allowing developers to use the same syntax for both portions of a Cardano DApp.\nHelios is a Javascript/Typescript SDK alternative created to onboard web developers from the Javascript/Typescript ecosystem -- among the largest developer communities -- onto Cardano.\nThe Helios toolkit works for both on-chain and off-chain code. The Helios language can also be used to calculate and manage Cardano assets during a transaction, making it a versatile alternative in the Cardano ecosystem for programmers of all backgrounds.\nPlutarch is a domain-specific language for on-chain code based on Haskell. Plutarch's higher level of abstraction compared to Haskell gives developers ways to write highly efficient smart contracts.\nPlutarch's main purpose is to optimize the size of a validator, making transactions as cheap as possible.\nAlso, see a list of developer tools on Essential Cardano or check out some of the most popular builder tools on the Developer Portal.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Community?",
    "completion": "A stake pool is a network node holding the combined ada ('stake') of several delegators. Stake pools yield rewards to those ada holders who choose to delegate their ada to them. Stake pools are used to ensure that everyone can participate in the Cardano Blockchain, regardless of technical experience or availability to keep a node running. These stake pools focus on maintenance and hold the combined stake of various stakeholders in a single entity. Stake pools are responsible for processing transactions that will be placed in the ledger, as well as producing new blocks.\nStake pools can be public or private. Any Cardano user can delegate ada to public pools. Private stake pools, however, only deliver rewards to their owners.\nVisit this page for more information about stake pools.\nEducation is central to the Cardano mission. That s why IOG, the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo and other Cadano participants are all committed to upskilling developers to build on Cardano blockchain.\nThrough this education outreach, the Cardano community is being equipped with the essential skills they need to build on Cardano. An empowered community means a stronger ecosystem.\nDuring 2021, IOG launched the Plutus Pioneer and Atala Pioneer programs. Together, these programs saw over 3,500 participants trained on Plutus and Atala and were very well received amongst the community. A Marlowe Pioneer Program will launch mid 2022.\nEarlier in 2022, IOG launched the IOG Academy, a library of educational videos and materials covering Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe.\nIOG also recently established a partnership with the European Business University of Luxembourg (EBU), with the goal of making education accessible for everyone in developing countries. EBU has so far rolled out courses on Haskell and Plutus.\nAlso, IOG works with a number of universities worldwide.\nIn 2023, the Cardano Foundation launched the Cardano Academy. This free course requires no prior knowledge of, or experience in, blockchain, and successful completion leads to the Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate (CBCA) certification. 4 modules cover introductory to advanced blockchain topics, as well as a special focus on understanding how Cardano operates.\nAdditionally, the Cardano Academy is a centerpiece of the partnership between the Cardano Foundation and Petrobras, Brazil s state-owned energy company. In this partnership, the Cardano Foundation will lead blockchain education workshops for Petrobras employees, with Cardano Academy content delivered via the Petrobras University\nThe implementation of the native tokens feature enabled the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Cardano.\nThe native tokens feature extends the existing accounting infrastructure defined in the ledger model (originally designed for processing ada-only transactions) to accommodate transactions using a range of assets.\nNative support offers distinct advantages for developers: there is no need to create smart contracts to handle custom tokens, for example, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for manual errors since the ledger handles all token-related functionality.\nDue in part to the ease of creation and low minting costs, the NFT space has rapidly grown to be one of the most vibrant and creative elements of the early Cardano ecosystem, with over 400 projects and NFT marketplaces launched and live by early 2022. As of late December, 2023, nearly 9 million NFTs have been minted on Cardano.\nCardano is home to a wide range of NFT marketplaces, each offering unique experiences for creators and consumers. jpg.store is, to date, the largest platform for NFT markets, while Kreate is home for 1/1 artists and Edition minting, and cSwap showcases an innovative NFTfi approach utilizing liquidity pools for non-fungible assets.\nThe fungible token ecosystem on Cardano is vibrant, and TapTools has become the leading destination for token-trading and market analytics. DexHunter is Cardano's leading DEX aggregator, while platforms like Minswap, Wingriders, and Muesliswap stand out with the highest trading volumes.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Cardano Franken Addresses?",
    "completion": "On the Cardano blockchain, apart from storing information about the network and spending rights, a wallet address also contains information about the staking right. This characteristic sets it apart and makes it significantly different from wallet addresses on other blockchains.\nIn this article, we will deep dive into understanding the workings of a unique address format within Cardano, known as Franken addresses\nUnderstanding this concept optimizes the utilization of Franken addresses, safeguards one's holdings, and helps avoid vulnerabilities or security flaws during the creation of smart contracts on the Cardano network.\nShelley Wallet Address\nFirstly, we need to understand the current format of Cardano wallet addresses (from the Shelley era onwards).\nThe current Shelley wallet address, often seen most prominently after decoding via bech32, comprises the following fundamental components:\nHeader Byte: The first 4 bits contain information such as which network the address is for (testnet or mainnet), while the subsequent 4 bits denote the type of address (e.g., script address or regular wallet address).\nPayment Part: This section encrypts the public key of the wallet and is the most critical part of the address as it signifies who has the spending rights over the funds or assets associated with that address. The owner could be an individual or a smart contract holder, being the entity in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key designated within the address.\nDelegation Part: Typically comprises around 28 bits and comes immediately after the payment part. It indicates who has the authority to choose where the funds in the address are staked and has control over the rewards obtained from staking those funds.\nThe control of delegation also occurs through the corresponding private keys. In many instances, a wallet address might not have a delegation part, typically seen in wallets managing funds for others without engaging in staking activities.\nWhen a user creates a Cardano wallet, it can generate numerous receiving/sending addresses. However, all of these addresses share a single stake key located within the delegation part. This stake key is further encrypted into a stake address used for staking. Consequently, the user has the staking authority over the funds across all addresses linked to that wallet.\nNevertheless, anyone can create a payment or delegation address arbitrarily from two entirely different addresses. This means that we can easily generate a wallet address where the owner of the payment key designated in one address is different from the owner of the stake key designated in the delegation part. Such an address is termed a Franken address, a hybrid address, or a mangled address.\nThis hybrid address is a type of address that doesn't exist in any wallet but is manually coded using bech32 or can be created through the advanced functionality of the Eternl wallet by utilizing the payment key and delegation key from two distinct addresses.\nThe actual owner is the individual holding the payment key of address A, while the holder of the delegation key (B) holds temporary authority. When the funds within this address are completely spent, the staking rights associated with these funds cease to exist.\nWhen funds are transferred into a franken address where the payment part belongs to wallet A and the delegation part belongs to wallet B, the displayed balance within wallet B will alter. B then possesses the staking rights over this balance to receive rewards, while the actual asset amount within wallet B remains unchanged.\nExample:\nIf Alice sends 1,000 ADA to an address where the payment part is controlled by Bob, while the delegation (staking) key is still controlled by Alice, Bob can spend that 1,000 ADA, but Alice retains the authority to choose where to stake those funds and receive rewards from staking the 1,000 ADA.\nAll information, transactions, and assets from all addresses sharing the same staking key are recorded on the blockchain as transactions of a single wallet. Therefore, people often use the stake address of the wallet to verify information. Consequently, all information from the franken address is recorded on the stake address of wallet B. This is why information on wallet A's address remains entirely hidden. Thus, querying information from the stake address of the wallet on the blockchain can be relatively accurate but not entirely precise.\nIn the scenario where an NFT is transferred into this hybrid address, checking wallet A will show the presence of the NFT. However, when investigating ownership details, it will show wallet B as the owner. To prove the true ownership of the NFT, providing the corresponding signature of the payment part containing the NFT is necessary. Therefore, B will be unable to provide such proof.\nSome application developers may leverage delegation rights to receive rewards or assist users in maintaining their staking rights while their funds are locked in the application's smart contract. By designating the user's delegation part within the receiving address (similar to what platforms like Wingriders or Indigo are doing):\nFor instance: A user sends 1000 ADA into a smart contract (containing a franken address with the user's delegation key) and mints 300 iUSD. Recorded transaction information:\nAddress: stake01abc - 1000 ADA (sent)\nAddress: stake01abc + 300 iUSD (received),\nStaking Controlled + 1,000 ADA.\nIf the amount locked in the smart contract is liquidated, this displayed balance will also be affected and reduced accordingly.\nAny user can create a franken address to transfer their funds without revealing their primary wallet address by sending funds to a hybrid address containing their payment key and delegation key from different wallets.\nThe franken address serves as a means to register additional commitment to a staking pool without requiring a secondary ownership registration on the blockchain.\nWhile users do not lose the spending rights to their funds, malicious actors can stake the exchanged funds until the victim realizes that these funds do not contribute to their staking balance or until their wallet inadvertently uses this amount in a transaction.\nIn the NFT market, malicious buyers might exploit this vulnerability to control the funds they use to purchase NFTs by sending payment to a hybrid address where the seller controls the payment part but designates the buyer's staking key in the delegation part.\nMalicious actors can use someone else's delegation key, creating a franken address to seize benefits from staking. For example, signing up for whitelists, receiving NFTs, receiving token airdrops, ISPO (Initial Stake Pool Offering) participation, etc. This is similar to the case of Ray's ISPO being hacked using a Franken address as mentioned above.\nOn decentralized exchanges, agents can exploit this loophole using a franken address to take control of users' staking rights when executing asset swap transactions.\nExample: Alice wants to swap 100 ADA for WRT tokens. Bob wants to swap 200 WRT tokens for 100 ADA. Jack acts as an intermediary on the trading platform and exploits this vulnerability. He creates a transaction contract but sends the funds to the hybrid address containing Jack's stake key to hijack the staking rights of the exchanged amount.\nWhen aware that the funds in their wallet have been exchanged, users can reclaim their staking rights by transferring the entire exchanged amount back to their correct wallet address.\nCompared to wallet address types on other blockchain networks, addresses on Cardano are unique and more complex. Anyone can create a wallet address that holds control by two different owners. Therefore, the characteristics of Franken addresses on Cardano need more awareness to help developers and users understand their functionality, protect their own interests, and avoid unforeseen complications.\nHence, we have explored the concept of hybrid addresses on Cardano. Real-life use cases, as well as some remedies to address shortcomings, are available for readers to refer to at the end of the article.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "The Best of Cardano Summit?",
    "completion": "The Cardano Summit took place in Dubai at the weekend. Let's take a look at some news and interesting things that caught our attention.\nMidnight got the most attention.\nCharles Hoskinson presented a new framework that will offer new ways for developers and validators to utilize Cardano. It should allow third parties to build new optimized partner chains. Partner chains allow combining modular blockchain technology with Cardano s proven security, liquidity, and reliability.\nMidnight is supposed to be the first sidechain (or also a partner chain) with its consensus mechanism (combination of PoW and PoS) and ledger (which will be partly public and partly private).\nIn the original design of Cardano, which was published in the now legendary document Why Cardano, it is proposed to separate the settlement layer (CSL) from the computation layer (CCL). One common settlement layer can thus serve many computation layers and even be the ultimate cross-chain settlement layer.\nYou can imagine in a simplified way that next to the Plutus platform there will be other platforms that will share the ledger (assets).\nMidnight is to be the first partner chain of Cardano. We don't know why the IOG team decided on a new terminology, that is, what exactly it means to be a partner chain. We will have to wait for further details, especially regarding how partner chains use CSL.\nThe IOG team decided to use the Substrate stack from Parity Technologies. This is a proven open-source modular framework that uses the Polkadot project. More details about the framework and the possibility of building new partner chains were not revealed.\nSubstrate is a blockchain framework that allows you to build fully customized blockchain nodes to suit your application or business model needs.\nIt is interesting how Cardano and Polkadot meet each other. The CEOs of both projects were the founders of Ethereum. In the past, the Polkadot team used Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake. Now the IOG team uses Substrate.\nThis is not unusual in the open-source world. The use of existing technologies accelerates development. I see it as both projects are leaders in innovation and support each other.\nThere are many unanswered questions surrounding the new framework and Midnight. As far as I know, developers can use Substrate to create a standalone blockchain that does not need the Polkadot consensus and ledger. These blockchains can be run entirely autonomously, which means they do not depend on any external technology to run. In the context of Cardano, it appears that it will not be necessary for the partner chain to use the Cardano Settlement Layer.\nAt the Summit, we also learned something about tokenomics. Midnight should have two tokens. One of them will be DUST, and ADA holders should receive a DUST airdrop. It was not announced in what proportion or other details.\nCardano will (finally) have a USD-backed stablecoin. The Mehen (USDM) project is very likely to win first place. The launch is scheduled for December 19, 2023. USDM will be minted in 13 US states. The team is awaiting approval in other states.\nFingers crossed that the launch happens on the announced date. Cardano has native assets, so there will be a stablecoin that will not be subject to transaction censorship and account freezing on the blockchain. The team was able to negotiate approval for Cardano, which is a remarkable achievement considering that Emurgo was unsuccessful with their USDA in this regard.\nUSDM is very likely to bring new liquidity to the Cardano ecosystem and this can give DeFi a big boost. Stablecoins are essential to fulfill the mission of the project. Financial services cannot do without stability.\nThere was a lot of talk at the summit about decentralization and governance. You could learn more about DReps, SanchoNet, Intersect s role in Cardano s governance, etc.\nA panel discussion took place in which the transparency of governance and the challenges associated with it were discussed. Charles Hoskinson elaborated that having a governance system and giving people the power to change it can lead to amazing things.\nProbably the most important information for the teams is that the Catalyst Fund11 will be launched on November 15.\nThe Catalyst team heard criticism about downvoting, which significantly affected the results of Fund10. The biggest news is that the downvoting option will be removed in Fund11.\nThere was talk of adopting blockchain technology. Experts mentioned that ordinary people do not understand how to use blockchain. Education is seen as a necessity for further adoption. One of the panelists highlighted the shortage of understanding regarding select protocols, a reality that can stifle innovation, further stressing the importance of educating leaders and key stakeholders alongside the broader society.\nThere was a lot of debate about Web3 and the importance of communities. Also about regulations and enterprise adoption, or tokenization of real assets.\nA panel of legal experts talked about the global blockchain regulation situation. They noted that licensing for blockchain-based business models has started reaching the mainstream debate.\nOne of the panel discussion participants emphasized that the race for mass adoption of blockchain has already started within an evolving regulatory environment, making it essential for projects without a solid footing to pivot quickly.\nA very interesting panel discussion took place on the topic of the adoption of blockchain technologies in developing countries.\nSeveral masterclasses on various topics took place from the biggest experts from the community (for example, the SPO masterclass).\nThe Battle of the Builders took place. The top 10 contestants presented their pitches in front of the jury and Summit attendees. Each project received five minutes to present their project. Maestro (Web3 stack that makes it easy to build DApps) received the first place, while the second went to NEWM (music streaming marketplace) and the third to zkFold (rollups scaling solution that uses zero-knowledge cryptography).\nPast Summits have put more emphasis on technology. I had the impression from the 2023 Summit that there was more talk about the use of technology and adoption. Mithril, Hydra, and Marlowe were talked about, but more space was given to industry experts and builders from the community. This is positive news, as it shows that Cardano is much more ready for adoption than in previous years.\nThe CEO of the promising new DEX Axo spoke on stage. Mehen USD appeared in Battle of the Builders. Also, for example, the Finest project building a platform to trade tokenized real-world assets (RWA). We know that Cardano has a new NFT marketplace called JamOnBread.\nThe Cardano Summit is an important event because it shows the outside world that the project is still alive, and continues to develop and grow. Every year, the Summit is bigger and more covered by the media. Last weekend, social networks were full of Cardano. It was positive to see some Cardano skeptics change their minds during the Summit and start thinking more positively about the project.\nThe Summit was a big event mainly for those who flew to Dubai and met other members of the community. It is possible to make new contacts, get new ideas, or even make new partnerships.\nThe most discussed topic is and will probably continue to be Midnight and the new framework. Until more details are revealed, many people, including us, will be mulling over many details. We learned that the monetary policy of the Midnight is still being fine-tuned. No project launch date has been announced. All we know is that there is a Pioneer program going on (in which there was huge interest and not all interested parties can participate).\nIt is not possible to squeeze all the thoughts and details that could be seen and heard at the Cardano Summit into one article. However, the videos are freely available on the Cardano Foundation's YouTube. You can choose a topic that interests you.\nBrought to you by Cardano Explorer Cexplorer.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "When should I withdraw my staking rewards?",
    "completion": "Staking rewards left in the rewards section of your wallet count towards your total balance staked. They therefore automatically compound without the need to withdraw them to the main part of your wallet. Each time you withdraw your staking rewards you will pay a transaction fee, which at the time of writing this is around 0.17 ada. This might not seem like a lot but it could add up over time. So it's best to leave your rewards in your rewards address until you need them.\nAs your staking rewards are held in the rewards address of your wallet, and not by the stake pool, you do not need to withdraw your staking rewards when delegating from one stake pool to another. You also do not need to withdraw your rewards when switching to a new wallet interface.\nSome wallets offer an option to withdraw rewards at the same time as making a transaction. This reduces the withdrawal fee to a fraction of what you would normally pay to withdraw your rewards.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

If you have recently voted in Project Catalyst you may want to wait until you have also received your voting rewards.\nClaim your remaining rewards and unstake or deregister your stake key to receive your 2 stake key deposit that you paid when you registered your stake key.\nSend all of the remaining to your new wallet.\nYou may want to keep your old wallet set up or keep hold of your seed phrase in case you need access to the information for tax purposes.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "What is an ISPO what are the different types of ISPO?",
    "completion": "ISPO is an acronym for Initial Stake Pool Offering. There are two main types but in both cases they enable projects that are building on Cardano to distribute their tokens to stake pool delegators. The tokens that are distributed generally have some sort of utility such as governance privileges in the project. The tokens can be held by the delegator for the utility or, if listed on one, can be traded on an exchange.\nCommunity building ISPO\nThis type of ISPO uses the existing stake pool operator community to help raise awareness of and build a community around a project. A number of stake pools are selected to partner with the project and delegators of the partnered stake pools receive, or are able to claim, the project's token and also receive their regular staking rewards in ada. Stake pools are able to attract new delegators by being able to offer this extra incentive to join them. In an attempt to attract delegators, the stake pool operators would promote the project that they are partnered with, which would raise the profile of the project.\nFundraising ISPO\nThis type of ISPO is used to raise funds to finance the build and development of a project. In a fundraising ISPO, the project would run their own stake pools and set a high margin fee, sometimes 100 . The delegators would forfeit some or all of their normal staking rewards in ada in return for the promise of some of the project's tokens at a later date.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "What is a blockchain?",
    "completion": "A blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger, is a digital book of records. Unlike traditional financial systems, blockchains are decentralized and are not regulated by any central authority. In a blockchain, nodes (people's computers) agree on the validity of any given transaction using what is called a consensus mechanism. Transactions are grouped together and stored in blocks that are added to the chain in set periods of time called slots. These transactions are visible to everyone, and once validated, records cannot be altered. This immutability guarantees transparency and trust between users.\nThe advantages of decentralized systems over traditional ones are the following:\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "Is ada a coin or a token?",
    "completion": "Both coins and tokens represent a unit of cryptocurrency on a blockchain. Yet there is a difference between the two a coin has its own native blockchain whereas a token is created on an existing blockchain.\nAda ( Ticker: ADA ) is the native cryptocurrency on Cardano and is the only currency used on Cardano to pay fees, make deposits and distribute rewards. In this sense, ada is a coin because it is native to Cardano in the same way that bitcoin is a coin on the Bitcoin blockchain and ether is a coin on Ethereum.\nCoins represent one type of digital assets. Other types of digital assets may still represent a footprint of value but may be designed for different purposes. These include tokens, NFTs, stablecoins, and other digital assets which represent value in the real world, such as a property deed, a government or corporate bond, an education certificate, ownership of a basketball boot, information, or a vote in an election. On Cardano, all of these can be represented as a native token . This means an NFT or another type of asset can be minted (created) directly on the blockchain, without having to use a smart contract. This native capability is not available on other blockchains.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

This necessitates a process whereby funds are regularly sent to the Treasury to ensure that funds are always available.\nCardano's monetary policy aims to keep the protocol sustainable in the long term ensuring its decentralization and security. Monetary policy must provide sufficient economic incentive to maintain the protocol and develop the ecosystem. More than 75 of ada is already in circulation. The protocol will distribute the remaining coins periodically each epoch in the coming years as rewards for pool operators and delegators. The Cardano protocol has a capped number of coins and will only depend on fees in the future. There is no never-ending inflation of ada coins.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

This model is vastly superior to the account-based model used by other blockchains because it ensures:\nEnhanced security: every transaction uses a different address, which makes it impossible to track the address or find out the user s overall balance.\nScalability: UTXO ledgers allow for transaction parallelization, which reduces congestion.\nInteroperability: due to the implementation of off-chain and sidechain protocols, it is easier to establish interoperability between different blockchains.\nDeterminism: on the UTXO ledger, a user can predict the cost and validity of a transaction before it is processed on the chain.

  {
    "prompt": "What is the Cardano network?",
    "completion": "The Cardano network is a technical infrastructure combining Cardano nodes and their relative interactions in one unified system. It consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger. These nodes validate blocks, add blocks to the chain, and distribute transactions.\nThe networking layer is the driving force for delivering information exchange requirements for establishing a better data flow. Cardano nodes maintain connections with peers that have been chosen via a custom peer selection process.\nA set of mini-protocols is used to enable communication between different nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as:\ninforming peers of the latest block\nsharing blocks as needed\nsharing new transactions around the Cardano network.\nFor connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. For example, there are two protocol suites: node-to-node and node-to-client. The node-to-client protocol suite is used by wallets and chain consumers. Protocol suites use different sets of mini-protocols and the version is negotiated when a new connection is established.\nFind out more:\nThe Cardano network\nNetworking protocol design\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) networking\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "What is proof of stake PoS?",
    "completion": "In proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, such as Cardano, stake pool operators validate network activities. Operators (or slot leaders) are elected based on their holdings (stake) in the associated cryptocurrency (ada).\nOne of the key features of PoS is that as an operator's value increases, the opportunity to maintain the ledger also increases. This means a higher chance to produce new blocks that can be added to the blockchain and timestamped accordingly. The creator of a new block is chosen based on a combination of random selection and a determination of their stake, or wealth. A type of leader election occurs within the chain. Within a proof-of-stake protocol, participants get rewards for helping maintain network activities. This approach encourages the steady and stable growth of the blockchain incentivizing participants at the same time.\nPrimary advantages of proof of stake\nSome of the primary advantages of PoS over PoW include:\nrigorous security protocols are incorporated into a PoS protocol\nreduced centralization - the risk of centralization is reduced by protocol parameters eliminating power accumulation for one participant\nenergy efficiency - energy consumption is extremely efficient as a smaller amount of electricity, as well as hardware resources, are needed to produce and run the blockchain\ncost efficiency - PoS currencies are far more cost-effective than those operating on PoW protocols\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "What is consensus?",
    "completion": "Consensus means agreement. A consensus protocol is a way for blockchain participants to agree on transaction validity. The consensus protocol for Cardano is Ouroboros.\nIn a traditional setting, a central entity (like a bank) controls individuals funds and financial activity. This entity decides what kind of activity an individual can do, to whom they can send funds, or put a limit on certain operations.\nIn a decentralized setting, no single entity is in control of individuals financial activity. That is why it is crucial to ensure that decisions made within the system are true, valid, and reached without the common pattern of centralized leadership management.\nTo ensure trust and security in financial operations, blockchains use the consensus algorithm. In essence, a consensus is what controls the laws and parameters governing the behavior of blockchains. Think of consensus as a ruleset that each network participant adheres to. It is the process of reaching a majority opinion by everyone involved in running the blockchain. An agreement must be made on which blocks to produce, which chain to adopt, and how to determine the single state of the network.\nThe consensus protocol has three main responsibilities:\nperform a leader check and decide if a block should be produced\nhandle chain selection\nverify produced blocks\nBlockchains create consensus by allowing participants to bundle transactions that others have submitted to the system in blocks, and add them to their chain (sequence of blocks). Determining who is allowed to produce a block when, and what to do in case of conflicts, (such as two participants adding different blocks at the same point of the chain), is the purpose of the consensus protocol.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

This layer includes protocol parameters that control capabilities such as scalability and throughput. Layer 2 is an additional, off-chain protocol that works on top of the layer 1 blockchain. Parties can securely transfer funds from the blockchain into an off-chain protocol, settle transactions in this protocol independently of the underlying chain, and safely transfer funds back to the underlying chain as needed.

    "prompt": "What is Cardano governance about?",
    "completion": "Cardano s decentralized governance model grants all ada holders the ability to decide what changes should be made for the ecosystem to grow and mature. Since individuals in the Cardano ecosystem are most affected by the decisions made about the protocol, it is important for them to understand how those decisions are made and how they are paid for, as well as how to participate in that process. Voltaire is the phase in Cardano's development that deals with decentralized governance and decision-making. It focuses on the Cardano community s ability to decide on software updates, technical improvements, and project funding. To participate in the decision-making process, all ada holders can suggest a change through the Cardano improvement proposal (CIP) system, or participate in Project Catalyst to vote on what changes should be made.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "What is stake delegation?",

  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is staking and delegation on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Every ada holder owns a stake that is based on the amount of ada they have. A developer or a tech-savvy person can set up a stake pool and run it to help verify Cardano transactions and create new blocks getting rewards for this.

  {
    "prompt": "How does Ouroboros work?",
    "completion": "Ouroboros randomly elects a slot leader from among the stake pools to create block within a slot. A slot is the primary unit of time used by the Ouroboros algorithm. The more stake a pool controls, the greater the chance it has of being elected as a slot leader to produce a new block. When validating a transaction, a slot leader needs to ensure that the sender has included enough funds to pay for that transaction and must also ensure that the transaction s parameters are met. If the transaction meets all these requirements, the slot leader will record it as a part of a new block, which will then be added to the chain.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "When will I receive my rewards?",
    "completion": "Rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch (every five days). If this is the first time you delegated your funds to a pool, the process will take longer. If you delegate your ada during the first epoch, the pool that you delegate to can produce blocks two epochs later. Two epochs after that, you will begin receiving rewards. In this case, you will begin receiving staking rewards after 20 days.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "What is the saturation point?",
    "completion": "Saturation is a term used to indicate that a particular stake pool has more stake delegated to it than is ideal for the network. Saturation is displayed as a percentage. Once a stake pool reaches 100 saturation, it will offer diminishing rewards. The saturation mechanism was designed to prevent centralization by encouraging delegators to delegate to different stake pools, and operators to set up alternative pools so that they can continue earning maximum rewards. Saturation, therefore, exists to preserve the interests of both ada holders delegating their stake and stake pool operators.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  {
    "prompt": "What is a profit margin?",
    "completion": "A profit margin is the percentage of total ada rewards that the stake pool operator takes before sharing the rest of the rewards among all the delegators to the pool. A lower profit margin for the operator means they are taking less, which means that delegators can expect to receive more of the rewards for their delegated stake. A private pool is a pool with a profit margin of 100 , meaning that all the rewards will go to the operator and none to the delegators.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

In this model, assets are represented as balances within users accounts, and the balances are stored as a global state of accounts, kept by each node, and updated with every transaction.\nIn many respects, account-based chains (such as Ethereum) operate in a similar fashion to traditional bank accounts. The wallet's balance increases when coins are deposited, and decreases when coins are transferred elsewhere. This poses a security risk since the recipient s address can be tracked to reveal its balances, which is not possible with UTXOs.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is a UTXO?",
    "completion": "UTXO stands for unspent transaction output. This model allows keeping track of users balances after sending or receiving funds on the blockchain. In the UTXO model, a transaction has inputs and outputs, where the inputs are unspent outputs from previous transactions. As soon as an output is used as input in a transaction, it becomes spent and can never be used again.\nUTXO is, in many ways, similar to cash. A good analogy is this: Imagine you have $50 in your wallet. This amount could be made up with several combinations: two $20 bills and one $10, four $10 bills and two $5 bills, and many others. But regardless of the permutations, the amount ($50) remains equal. UTXOs work in the same way. Whatever balance you have in your blockchain wallet (say, 150 coins) could be made up with many different UTXO combinations, based on previous transactions, but the balance amount remains the same. In other words, the balance held in a given wallet address is the sum of all unspent UTXOs from previous transactions.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

Zero-knowledge proofs are designed so that a prover is able to indirectly verify that a statement is true without having to provide any information beyond the correctness of the statement, e.g. to prove that a number is found that solves a cryptographic puzzle and fits the hash value without having to reveal the Nonce\nThe Bulletproofs technology is a Non-interactive Zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof protocol for general Arithmetic Circuits with very short proofs (Arguments of Knowledge Systems) and without requiring a trusted setup. They rely on the Discrete Logarithm (DL) assumption and are made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic. The name Bulletproof originated from a non-technical summary from one of the original authors of the scheme s properties: Short like a bullet with bulletproof security assumptions\nBulletproofs also implement a Multi-party Computation (MPC) protocol, whereby distributed proofs of multiple provers with secret committed values are aggregated into a single proof before the Fiat-Shamir challenge is calculated and sent to the verifier, thereby minimizing rounds of communication. Secret committed values will stay secret.\nThe essence of Bulletproofs is its inner-product algorithm originally presented by Groth and then further refined by Bootle et al. The latter development provided a proof (argument of knowledge) for two independent (not related) binding vector Pedersen Commitments that satisfied the given inner-product relation. Bulletproofs build on these techniques, which yield communication-efficient, zero-knowledge proofs, but offer a further replacement for the inner product argument that reduces overall communication by a factor of three.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

The individual parts of the acronym have the following meaning:\nSuccinct: verifier run time is exponentially less than running the complete computation\nNon-interactive: there is no interaction. For zkSNARKs, there is usually a setup phase and after that a single message from the prover to the verifier. Furthermore, SNARKs always have the so-called public verifier property meaning that anyone can verify without interacting anew, which is important for blockchains.\nARguments: the verifier is only protected against computationally limited provers. Provers with enough computational power can create proofs/arguments about wrong statements (Note that with enough computational power, any public-key encryption can be broken). This is also called computational soundness , as opposed to perfect soundness .\nKnowledge soundness: it is not possible for the prover to construct a proof/argument without knowing a certain so-called witness (for example the address she wants to spend from, the preimage of a hash function or the path to a certain Merkle-tree node).\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20240112?",
    "completion": "This week, the core technology teams released node v.8.7.3, which addresses a minor fix in ouroboros-network. This release resolves an issue in the outbound-governor where, under rare but reproducible conditions, the governor could lose track of certain outbound connections, such as a local root or another node. Benchmarking reports relevant to v.8.7.2 release remain applicable to v.8.7.3 and can be found in this Cardano updates post.\nouroboros-network\noutbound-governor\nThe networking team worked on some issue analysis and the `tx-submission` decision logic.\nOver the past two weeks, the consensus team resumed work on implementing the initialization and internals of the second iteration of the in-memory ledger database, and also on integrating the new ledger database API for UTXO-HD.\nAdditionally, the team simplified query versioning for downstream users, confirmed the cause of missed leadership checks due to ledger snapshots, and derived principles for the versioning/declaration of queries, since Conway complicates it.\nFinally, they unblocked the node team s work on rollback-insensitive leadership schedule queries and drafted the (pre-Genesis) bootstrap state machine for bootstrap peers.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Lace team released version 1.8, which resolves a bug with the signData method failing, provides stake pool rewards performance in a graph, and enables synchronization with other multi-address wallets. Read this blog post for more details. The team has now regrouped after the holidays and are working on new exciting features.\nsignData\nThis week, the Plutus tools team worked on performances to improve both the synchronization time and the memory footprint of Marconi to maintain the ledger state. At the same time, the team continued the effort of bundling Marconi with cardano-node to ease the indexation of ledger states and consensus events. They are now able to index ledger states using this solution, which is a huge milestone for the release of a queryable node using Marconi.\ncardano-node\nFinally, the team improved the tooling to compare the indexers with the indexation of DB Sync.\nThe Plutus Core team merged two new primitives for bitwise operations: integerToByteString and byteStringToInteger. They will be made available in Plutus v3 after the Conway hard fork.\nintegerToByteString\nbyteStringToInteger\nThis week, the Marlowe team revised marlowe-plutus enhancements by publishing new asData validators and removing PlutusTx.asData for Action. They also embedded validators by replacing the usages of data files with template Haskell, added currentRange to the restClient#getContracts response for Marlowe TS-SDK integration tests, and created the theme for TS-SDK reference.\nmarlowe-plutus\nasData\nPlutusTx.asData\nAction\ncurrentRange\nrestClient#getContracts\nFinally, the team queried volume benchmarking for Marlowe Runtime.\nOver the past couple of weeks, the Hydra team completed the implementation of the Conway support feature, fixed a minor bug that was hindering tests running on MacOS, and addressed a regression in the protocol-parameter formats used by the Hydra node. They also worked on off-chain code for incremental decommits, specifically focusing on transaction creation. Finally, they conducted a spike on implementing a chess game using Hydra, providing the experience report.\nThe Mithril team worked on implementing the client in the explorer to enable direct verification of certificates from the browser. They also addressed the configuration issue in the signer node service, which occasionally resulted in signers not registering their keys after a restart. Additionally, the team kept implementing a mock aggregator to strengthen Mithril client tests in WASM, continued working on threat modeling and risk analysis for P2P networking, and progressed with the devnet upgrade to support the Conway era.\nFinally, they worked on enhancing node communications between Mithril and Cardano and completed the upgrade of the Cardano node topology used in the Mithril networks' infrastructure.\nCardano s momentum will continue requiring the community s collective focus and participation this year, and the IOG Voltaire team will continue to contribute to the decentralized governance and decision making. The key moments in early 2024 will be the release of an interim constitution and technical guardrails for use during the Voltaire bootstrapping phase, laddering up to a constitutional convention later this year, where community-elected delegates will congregate and work together to pass a final version of the Cardano constitution to be ratified on-chain by the Cardano community.\nCardano s core repositories have now been fully transitioned to Intersect s stewardship. This marks a significant step toward decentralized governance. Explore the details of this crucial transition in Intersect s recent blog post. If you are interested in joining any of the Intersect committees and working groups, you can reach out to the membership and community committee directly by emailing mcc@intersectmbo.org. If you are interested in learning more about Intersect membership, you can do so here.\nSanchoNet continues to make good progress. It is now possible to use a testnet version of the Lace wallet, called Lace SanchoNet, to connect to the SanchoNet Voltaire GovTool and participate in Cardano governance features from CIP-1694 in a controlled testnet environment. Learn more here.\nThis week, Project Catalyst held its first town hall of the year. The next meeting is scheduled for the following week and then every Wednesday thereafter, always at 5 PM UTC. You can register here.\nFund11 is progressing through the community review stage, now entering the moderation part where experienced community members help cross-check the output of the reviews. Results of this stage should be known within two weeks.\nIn other news, Catalyst voter registration for Fund11 ends on January 15, and the snapshot of the voting power will take place at 21:45 UTC on that date. If you already have a valid voter registration from Fund10 and access to your existing QR/PIN code then you are already registered.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20231117?",
    "completion": "Over the past two weeks, the consensus team managed to run a UTXO-HD capable node in legacy mode, maintaining the baseline memory usage while keeping all the ledger state in memory (as the current node does). This legacy mode could provide an alternative for releasing a UTXO-HD capable node where users can choose whether or not to store the large part of the UTXO set on disk. Implementing legacy mode entails code duplication and necessitates several weeks of integration and testing before achieving production readiness.\nThe teams will not release the UTXO-HD feature before Conway to avoid the risk of delaying the latter. On the other hand, to integrate the LSM-tree backend for UTXO-HD, it is essential to redesign the consensus storage layer, and this new design might enable the implementation of an alternative in-memory backing store that will have very similar performance and resource requirements as the current Cardano node. Therefore, during the coming months, the team will focus their efforts on redesigning the storage layer and the LSM-tree backend.\nOn the Genesis front, the team reviewed the peer simulator for Genesis tests, which was implemented by Tweag and signed off by the consensus team.\nThey also continued improving the handling of blocks from the future and presented possible approaches in the chief scientist meeting at IOG, which was very well-received. The discussion with the IOG scientists touched upon the relationship of this approach to Ouroboros Chronos.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Lace team released version 1.7, with updates for the multi-staking feature, such as new tools to reduce drift and better insights on staking pool retirement and saturation.\nThe Plutus tools team continued working on the Marconi API queries, Marconi cardano-node-emulator, and documentation improvements.\nThe Marlowe team improved the performance of FindTxsFor operation and the chain indexer. They also tested the vesting DApp prototype, published the token plan README, and tested the Marlowe Runner functionality, also adding relevant links to the explorer and Playground. Additionally, the team updated the Deploying Marlowe Runtime overview to be consistent with the Marlowe starter kit, reviewed user documentation for TS-SDK, and defined small-step semantics in Agda.\nFindTxsFor\nOver the last two weeks, the Hydra team published the October report and delivered a presentation and a workshop at the Cardano Summit, contributing to community engagement. They also implemented a dirt road solution for the Ignored init tx notification and moved the hydra-poll example project to a dedicated repository. Additionally, the team built a hydra-chain-observer tool for Hydra heads, updated the toolchain to GHC v.9.6.3, and made various improvements to tooling and code formatting. They addressed specific issues, such as fixing the gen-hydra-keys command and resolving concerns with the rewritten hydra-tui. The team also enhanced the hydra-cluster smoke test suite by fetching network configurations dynamically.\nFinally, they reviewed multiple pull requests and architectural decision records from the community, including contributions from SundaeSwap. The Cardano Foundation completed and deployed an experiment, the Hydra tally, to mainnet.\nThis week, the Mithril team completed the adaptation of the Mithril client as a library. They progressed in decentralizing the Mithril networks with the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking proof-of-concept, achieving the implementation of P2P signatures broadcast with the relay in the end-to-end tests. Additionally, the team completed the proof-of-concept for the deterministic computation of the UTXO/transactions set from immutable files.\nFinally, they continued addressing some performance issues associated with the 'release-mainnet' aggregator and fixed a bug with the tool used to process batch certificate hash re-computation.\nThis week, IOG's Voltaire team, in collaboration with the Cardano Foundation, Intersect, and EMURGO, worked on preparing for the Cardano Ballot. Following 400 GitHub comments, 50 global workshops across 23 countries, and over 1,000 participants, CIP-1694 will be up for a vote.\nThe ballot is designed as a 'temperature check,' providing the opportunity for ada holders from various backgrounds to express their opinions on the future decision-making process for the Cardano blockchain. Voting will take place on December 1-11, 2023. Ada holders must have delegated their ada to a stake pool operator (SPO) by November 20, 2023, as holders must stake a minimum of one lovelace to vote. The votes are exempt from transaction fees, and compatible wallets include the Yoroi wallet, Flint, Eternl, Nami, Typhon, Nufi, GeroWallet, and Lace.\nTo participate and have your say, head to: https://buff.ly/3QG7Y0t\nThis week, Project Catalyst launched Fund11, featuring a funding round of 50 million ada for redistribution to foster growth in the Cardano ecosystem. Catch the latest town hall recording or explore the Fund11 launch guide. Fund11 incorporates exciting changes based on community feedback and lessons learned. You can find a high-level overview here.\nSubmissions are now open with new categories until November 30 for public drafts. The proposal finalization period is extended until December 7.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20231110?",
    "completion": "This week, the core technology teams continued working on node, networking, and consensus enhancements.\nOver the last few weeks, the ledger team focused on the quality improvements of the Conway era implementation and the tooling used for ledger testing. They resolved several bugs related to the correct usage of DRep thresholds for ratification, treasury withdrawals, DRep stake distribution snapshotting, and delegation options. The team also worked on some Conway-related additions such as Conway ledger events, disallowing voting on expired proposals, and the constitutional committee anchor. Additionally, the team improved reusable interfaces for an ordered set OSet and ordered map OMap, which allowed to disable duplicate certificates and proposals in a transaction. The team also reorganized Plutus functionalities in preparation for Plutus v3 integration.\nOSet\nOMap\nMore progress has been made on the enhancement of a specialized Imp test library that allows writing concise stateful unit tests for verifying the ledger logic, and conformance testing, which allows interfacing with Haskell-generated code from the Agda specification. Finally, they extended the serialization testing to increase binary conformance coverage.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nLast week, the Lace team attended the Cardano Summit 2023, where team members met many project leaders interested in collaborating with IOG. They also worked on enhancing the multi-staking feature which will be released next week.\nThis week, the Plutus tools team kept working on Marconi API queries, cardano-node-emulator testing, and user documentation improvements.\nLast week, the Marlowe team presented two workshops at the Cardano Summit 2023 exploring Marlowe s suite of tools, safety features, DApp creation, and beginner-friendly smart contracts.\nThis week, the team revised safety checks for open roles in Runtime, added open roles integration tests, worked on related documentation, and added a lesson about open roles to the Runtime starter kit. They also reviewed and tested the vesting DApp, added the Marlowe token plan prototype, improved tracing for Marlowe chain sync protocols, tested Runner MVP, and improved the connection widget in marlowe-tokens-plans.\nThis week, the Mithril team kept working on the adaptation of the Mithril client as a library, which is almost completed. They progressed with decentralizing the Mithril networks with the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking proof of concept, for which they have achieved the implementation of a very basic working demo with a peer-to-peer publish-subscribe (pub-sub) mechanism. Also, the team kept working on the deterministic computation of the UTXO/transactions set from the immutable files.\nFinally, they resolved the naming issue of the Docker package responsible for storing images of the new Mithril client CLI and continued addressing a performance issue associated with the 'release-mainnet' aggregator.\nLast week, the Voltaire team worked hard alongside several team members present at the Cardano Summit (while others supported remotely) to showcase the progress made toward Cardano s on-chain governance.\nHighlights from the Cardano Summit include:\nA tech demo of GovTool\nA tech demo of SanchoNet\nThe announcement of the Cardano ballot for CIP-1694\nPanel discussions on the importance of community governance, and the importance of Intersect in Cardano governance\nOver 150 community members signed up to join Intersect. The Cardano Summit 2023 was an excellent opportunity to exhibit the ongoing progress towards the age of Voltaire to the broader community.\nThis week, the Catalyst team is in the final stages of refining the mobile app and backend for Fund11. They have focused on enhancing performance and functionality to ensure a top-tier user experience, including improvements such as faster loading times and near real-time updates on registration or voting power.\nSimultaneously, work is underway to introduce a robust load-testing framework to elevate testing capabilities. This strategic move aims to fortify the system's resilience, ensuring optimal performance under various loads and offering insight into any issues.\nThe teams are excited to expand collaboration opportunities by establishing open-source repositories for the Catalyst Voices and Hermes projects. This initiative aligns with the commitment to fostering innovation and community engagement. They have already initiated the foundational work for the Catalyst Voices backend, which is available in the open-source repository.\nLastly, they are currently developing a new community testing framework to enable users to test new capabilities before they reach production, allowing the community to offer feedback earlier in the development lifecycle. The open source and community testing initiatives will be presented in the coming weeks as proof of achievement for milestone 1 of the Voices and Hermes projects funded in Fund10.\nJoin the Catalyst Telegram announcement channel to stay updated with everything happening in Project Catalyst.\nLast week, several members of the Education team were present at the Cardano Summit to promote their programs and courses and meet the community.

    "completion": "This week, the ledger team achieved several milestones in Conway-related development. They fully implemented the constitutional committee, addressed governance actions related to treasury withdrawals, ensuring they now operate as expected, and enforced compliance with transaction rules by verifying the current treasury amount. They also implemented a mechanism to delay the expiration of delegate representative (DRep) positions when no proposals are available for voting, and changed the semantics of how CostModels are updated with protocol parameters to allow for individual Plutus language version updates, rather than requiring a complete replacement of all CostModels. They also made a range of performance and testing improvements.\nCostModels\nThe consensus team confirmed that the value-only workload benchmarks showed that the mempool forging regression observed in the UTXO-HD branch was fixed by the latest patch. Despite the increased resource requirements, key metrics like forging, peer-propagation, and end-to-end propagation show no regression when utilizing the UTXO-HD version of the Cardano node with the in-memory backend.\nOn the Genesis development, researchers continued their review of various design aspects, with particular attention to the Genesis rule's selection of the Cardano historical chain.\nFinally, the consensus team merged a fix for the Babbage to Conway transition and released a new version of consensus.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Lace team worked on the upcoming Lace v.1.6 release running tests against the new Cardano services, which will include portfolio persistence.

The team updated marlowe-cli run initialize not to write open roles validator to the Marlowe file, improved the OpenAPI document to be friendlier to ecosystem tooling, and updated marlowe-payouts with the ts-sdk 0.0.2-alpha-0 version.\nmarlowe-cli run initialize\nmarlowe-payouts\nts-sdk\nFinally, the team continued working on Marlowe Runner, making functionality and design improvements.\nThis week, the Hydra team primarily focused on developing a reliable new network layer and outlined its anticipated behavior in a new architectural decision record. They also released Hydra version 0.13.0, which fixes a few security vulnerabilities.\nAdditionally, the team reviewed the security policy and vulnerability disclosure policy for handling security vulnerabilities within Hydra, specifically addressing silent fixes , leading to the publication and fixing of three new security advisories.\nThe September development report is now published on the Hydra website.\nThe Mithril team updated a proposal for implementing Mithril in a light wallet and created a relevant discussion to receive feedback and contributions from the community.\nThey also completed a proof of concept to run a Mithril client in a browser with WASM and worked on enhancing the explorer UI with SPO tickers displayed next to the pool IDs. Additionally, the team finalized a tool for benchmarking aggregator performance over a range of signer and client loads and for visualizing the results of these benchmarks.\nFinally, they added a root page to the aggregator endpoint, created a status page for the Mithril networks, and added a section about KES key rotation in the signer documentation for SPOs.\nIn case you missed it, learn more about the GovTool, which was presented previously to test the governance features on SanchoNet. This tool allows ada holders to register on SanchoNet to become a delegate representative (DRep) and delegate voting power to other DReps.\nCommunity ownership is integral to governance tooling. Intersect, aided by its committees and working groups, will assume a significant role in hosting and maintaining these tools, subject to community approval. Together with various community builders, the goal is to establish the initial foundation layer, supporting essential off-chain governance processes for complete on-chain voting via CIP-1694. Once this foundation is set, the community can continue enhancing these tools by maintaining existing features, introducing new ones, or exploring entirely new areas. This can be done independently or with support from awards and grants administered by Intersect.\nTo find out about the progress made on CIP-1694 development, read this blog post about the advancement of CIP-1694 to a ballot.\nTo get involved in shaping the future of Cardano governance, make sure to join Intersect, visit the SanchoNet website, and join the conversations on Discord.\nThis week, Project Catalyst saw the start of the onboarding process for projects successfully selected in Fund10.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20230804?",
    "completion": "This week, the networking team activated several default traces for node-to-client and node-to-node protocols, which are set to be released in node v.8.2.0. Additionally, they ensured that the cardano-client-0.1.0.x library (used by db-sync) does not use the experimental node-to-client protocol, while cardano-client-0.2.0.0 remains unaffected. They also merged the dynamic block production feature into ouroboros-consensus, which enables hot-swap P2P nodes. These are important for the deployment of block-producing nodes.\nFinally, the team continued reviewing the implementation of big ledger peers for eclipse evasion.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Lace team dedicated efforts to adding Trezor support and implementing the multi-delegation feature. Additionally, they conducted end-to-end testing for Edge support, refactored heavily used utility functions, and focused on the setup of collateral.\nFinally, the team prepared for the implementation of CIP-95.\nThis week, the Plutus core team worked on adding decentralized governance support, as defined in CIP-1694, to Plutus v3.\nThe Marlowe team fixed the slot limit in the database, optimized the chain seek protocol, and added a contract source ID option to POST /contracts.\nFinally, they updated the Marlowe logo in Marlowe Playground and Marlowe Explorer and fixed some bugs in Marlowe Runtime.\nThis week, the Hydra team conducted their July monthly review meeting, which is an ongoing effort to ensure transparent communication and project evaluation. They successfully migrated the core logic of the node to an event-sourced architecture, allowing for incremental writes of events to persistence. This migration significantly improved the project's performance and maintainability. See this report for more details.\nThe team also implemented a new feature that enables the reading of protocol parameters through the API and fixed the CI workflows to support pull requests from forks of external contributors. These improvements streamline the development process encouraging community involvement in the project.\nThis week, the Mithril team completed the Mithril protocol s mainnet beta launch: the release-mainnet network is now consistently producing new certificates and snapshots! The team is monitoring the network and is preparing a new distribution that will be released shortly. They also kept working on the implementation of the stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator, and implementing the refactoring of the serialization/deserialization of the entities of the cryptographic library. Additionally, they started creating a runbook for the production infrastructure.\nrelease-mainnet\nFinally, they worked on upgrading the Cardano node to v.8.1.2, fixing the release-preprod network that stopped producing certificates, and troubleshooting the SPO s signer node that received unexpected errors.\nrelease-preprod\nThis week in Voltaire, the feedback collected from the CIP-1694 workshop is being reviewed and considered. An update will be published shortly. As CIP-1694 moves to its final form, the community will have the opportunity to vote on whether this MVG is an acceptable way to move forward together. This represents a powerful option for the crucial advancement of participatory governance within the Cardano ecosystem.\nIntersect was announced earlier this month, as a key institution for the ecosystem that brings together companies, developers, individuals, and other ecosystem participants to shape and drive the future development of Cardano. As such, it will be an administrator of processes that govern the continued roadmap and development of the Cardano platform and protocol.\nAll participants in the Cardano ecosystem are welcome to become Intersect members.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20230811?",
    "completion": "This week, the core technology teams tagged and pre-released node v.8.2.1-pre for use on SanchoNet, which is a new development network created to introduce the Cardano community to governance features from CIP-1694 and to build and test together in a controlled environment, through a rolling series of regular releases. See release notes for more details.\nThe networking team initiated the implementation of bootstrap peers. These peers are strategically designed to ensure the safety of nodes joining the network, while still harnessing the benefits of the distributed network for nodes that are synchronized. This marks an interim phase before Genesis, enabling the further distribution of the system. IOG, the Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo will initially oversee the operation of the bootstrap peers. The primary focus of these peers is on leaf nodes, such as full node wallets, that frequently engage in synchronization and require access to the honest blockchain. For more insights into the implementation plan, refer to the ouroboros-network pull request.\nThe ledger team mainly focused on implementing the Conway era. Their primary objective involved solidifying transaction-related types and their binary representation. The team also dedicated resources to help the Plutus team unblock their Plutus v3 integration. For more details on the Conway progress, see the technical update.\nThe consensus team focused on integrating the latest node version into the UTXO HD branch. Ad hoc benchmarks, involving syncing a node from scratch, revealed that the LMDB backend utilizes approximately 8GB of memory. Additionally, the team released updated versions of fs-sim, fs-api, and strict-checked-vars.\nfs-sim\nfs-api\nstrict-checked-vars\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Lace team released Lace v.1.4 introducing new features, ADA Handle support enhancements, and bug fixes. Users can now conveniently view personalized handles alongside regular ones under the receive tab and NFT viewing areas. The update also includes handle ownership monitoring, alerting users when a linked handle is transferred. Notable bug fixes involve the removal of unnecessary address validations, improved recipient address display in the Send pop-up, and the resolution of a screen reappearance issue after transactions.\nThe team also worked on simplifying the setup of collateral, enabling ledger transactions within the DApp connector, and scoping the workload for CIP-95.\nThis week, the Plutus tools team worked on adding the final sidechain requirements to Marconi, rewriting the Marconi indexers using a new simplified API, writing integration tests, and updating the cardano-api version in plutus-apps.\ncardano-api\nplutus-apps\nThe Plutus Core team focused on introducing a new feature to the Plutus Tx compiler. This feature will enable custom data types to be encoded as data, offering an alternative to Scott or sums-of-products terms. This enhancement will lead to reduced costs for generated Plutus scripts in various scenarios.\nThe Marlowe team enhanced Marlowe Runtime to execute arbitrary Plutus scripts alongside Marlowe, added an example usage of the Marlowe oracle, updated some instructions, implemented raffle scripts, and investigated the potential removal of dependencies to plutus-apps. They also fixed some issues, renamed Marlowe Explorer to MarloweScan, and wrote a specification for Open Roles in marlowe-cardano. Finally, they implemented the Open Roles MVP.\nThis week, the Hydra team updated the use case section for auctions on the unstable branch of the website, enhancing clarity around Hydra's practical applications. The team also implemented event-sourced persistence, which is a key enhancement in the project's architecture improving the performance of off-chain transaction processing.\nFinally, they introduced a new submit-transaction endpoint to the API and participated in community reviews for several Catalyst proposals related to Hydra and Mithril. In case you missed it, see the July report for more details.\nThis week, the Mithril team released a new distribution 2331.1, which includes some optimizations and bug fixes: the bootstrap time of a Cardano node restored from a Mithril snapshot has been significantly reduced, and a bug that made the aggregator produce corrupted archives has been fixed. They kept working on the implementation of the stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator: the first phase has been implemented, as well as a monitoring feature. Additionally, they kept implementing the refactoring of the serialization/deserialization of the entities of the cryptographic library, and working on the post deployment of the mainnet infrastructure.\n2331.1\nmainnet\nFinally, they completed the rewriting and enhancements of the documentation website and kept working on the runbook for operating a production Mithril network.\nThis week in Voltaire, an update has been posted on the feedback collected from the CIP-1694 workshops. As CIP-1694 moves to its final form, the community will have the opportunity to vote on whether this MVG is an acceptable way to move forward together. This represents a powerful option for the crucial advancement of participatory governance within the Cardano ecosystem.\nIntersect is a key institution for the ecosystem that brings together companies, developers, individuals, and other ecosystem participants to shape and drive the future development of Cardano. As such, it will be an administrator of processes that govern the continued roadmap and development of the Cardano platform and protocol.\nAll participants in the Cardano ecosystem are welcome to become Intersect members.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20230728?",
    "completion": "This week, the core technology teams released node v.8.1.2, which brings updates to the Plutus interpreter.\nThe ledger team focused on the implementation of Conway features into the ledger. Team members took part in the CIP-1694 workshop and had an in-person meeting discussing further steps for Conway era implementation. They also investigated some transaction validation issues on the preview testing environment relevant to the new node release, did some work to define the needed types for Plutus v3, and progressed on constraint-based generators, which now generate valid transactions and ledger state.\nThis week, the DB Sync team confirmed that the adaptor module provided by the consensus team for UTXO-HD integration shows no performance degradation. Other clients interested in integrating with UTXO-HD, without using on-disk storage, can currently use the mentioned adaptor module.\nThe team also focused on completing tracing support for UTXO-HD in cardano-node. They are working on UTXO-HD documentation, catering to both downstream consumers and the general public, and on further implementation generalization.\nWork is ongoing on Genesis design; the team decided to make a Genesis-motivated change to the epoch structure. They collaborated with researchers to produce a self-contained description of the statistical model for historical Genesis windows and eclipse durations. A couple of small improvements have already been merged into the ChainSync client.\nFinally, the consensus team investigated an issue on the Sanchonet (the Conway ledger testnet), which resulted in long syncing pauses. They identified a ledger bug and promptly collaborated with the ledger team to fix it.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Lace team worked on some fixes to support hardware wallet use within the DApp connector, refactored complex parts of the codebase, and ran a semi-automatic collateral setup to simplify DApp interactions. They also improved test automation, made some local development improvements, and continued working on Trezor support.\nThis week, the Plutus tools team worked on improving error reports for Marconi, bug fixes when storing LedgerStates on disk for the marconi-sidechain, and on completing the cardano-node-emulator demo.\nLedgerStates\nmarconi-sidechain\ncardano-node-emulator\nThe Plutus core team added new built-ins for Keccak-256, which will enhance compatibility with Ethereum. Additionally, they included Black2b-224 as a new built-in, enabling on-chain computation of PubKeyHash within Plutus. These additions will be available in Plutus v3.\nThe Marlowe team created a developer Docker image with Runtime and Jupyter notebooks, worked on Marlowe Runtime testing pre-launch for mainnet, filtered contracts by role token in Marlowe Run Lite, and added role payout support to the runtime client.\nThis week, the Hydra team updated the specification to align with recent off-chain protocol changes and completed the refactoring of the snapshot emission in preparation for event-sourced protocol logic. They also updated to GHC 9.2.7, which resulted in improved compiling times and slightly smaller Plutus scripts.\nThis week, the Mithril team released a new distribution 2329.0. The team launched Mithril protocol s mainnet beta: the release-mainnet network is now open for signer registrations, and its genesis certificate has been created. The team is monitoring the network, and expects it to start producing certificates during the next Cardano epoch. They also kept working on the implementation of the stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator. Additionally, the team kept working on the refactoring of the serialization/deserialization of the entities of the cryptographic library.\nrelease-mainnet\nFinally, they have worked on fixing installation bugs of the binary artifacts produced in the CI, and on enhancing the documentation for onboarding SPOs and setting up a Mithril signer.\nThis week in Voltaire, the feedback collected from the CIP-1694 workshop is being reviewed and considered. An update will be published shortly. As CIP-1694 moves to its final form, the community will have the opportunity to vote on whether this MVG is an acceptable way to move forward together. This represents a powerful option for the crucial advancement of participatory governance within the Cardano ecosystem.\nIntersect was announced earlier this month, as a key institution for the ecosystem, bringing together companies, developers, individuals, and other ecosystem participants to shape and drive the future development of Cardano. As such it will be an administrator of processes that govern the continued roadmap and development of the Cardano platform and protocol.\nAll participants in the Cardano ecosystem are welcome to become Intersect members.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20230714?",
    "completion": "You can read this report in English, Japanese and Spanish.\nThis week, the consensus team working on UTXO-HD discovered a space leak in the peer metrics code which was communicated to the networking team who proposed a fix for it. The team also conducted UTXO-HD benchmarks using a local immutable DB server, which demonstrated promising memory and time performance. However, they still plan to assess the performance of a memory-constrained machine.\nWork is ongoing on the Genesis design, the team started onboarding the team of engineers to implement the new Genesis protocol. They are also finalizing the statistical model for historical Genesis feasibility.\nOn the support front, the team drafted an information exchange requirement (IER) for the networking team to safely and efficiently control peer load.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThe Lace team released v.1.3, which introduces ADA Handle support for the regular and personalized handle, which users can test in the preview testing environment. Additionally, the update includes improvements in browser viewing responsiveness and the option to recover multi-address HD wallets.\nThe team continued working on Trezor support and on the creation of new UI components for the multi-delegation flow. They also worked on the Metadex UI, which is now deployed to the pre-production testing environment.\nFinally, work is ongoing on cardano-js-sdk the team released the import HD wallet feature and worked on input selection algorithm improvements for the multi-delegation feature.\nThis week, the Plutus tools team continued working on setting up the runtime monitoring for the Marconi sidechain, adding value and epochNo response fields to the getUtxosForAddress indexer and the afterTx query field for the getBurnTokenEvents indexer. Finally, they investigated how to make the standalone emulator usable with a real Cardano node socket client.\nOver the past two weeks, the Marlowe team added stake credential support to Marlowe Runtime CLI and REST API, expanded the testing of Plutus failures for safety analyses, added more data feeds to the Marlowe oracle, and fixed some bugs in the Marlowe starter kit. The team also updated the contract details page, improved styling and descriptions of the apply input steps, and provided a timestamp in Marlowe Run Lite UI instead of blockNo.\nblockNo\nFinally, the team implemented a user interface for the generative-art Marlowe contract (see commits 1, 2, 3, 4).\nThis week, the Hydra team continued securing the layer 2 network by implementing authentication of messages sent between peers in the Hydra Head protocol. In the process, they also managed to separate HeartBeat messages from the protocol ones which improved code quality. The team also finished work related to sending only transaction IDs in ReqSn messages, fixed an issue in the smoke tests, and improved benchmark publishing on the website.\nThis week, the Mithril team focused on preparing the beta launch on mainnet: they prepared an SPO on-boarding guide, kept working on the deployment of the mainnet infrastructure, and worked on enhancing the monitoring of the Mithril networks infrastructure. They also kept working on the implementation of a simple stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator. Additionally, the team completed the refactoring of the interface to the cryptographic library.\nmainnet\nFinally, they fixed a bug in the epoch gap detection of the certificate chain in the aggregator, fixed some flakiness in the CI, and worked on multiple other optimizations.\nThis week in Voltaire, representatives from around the globe gathered together to advance CIP-1694 as a proposal for Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) framework. Over the last six months, over 50 workshops took place that involved nearly 1,000 passionate community members globally discussing the details of the proposal. That collection of feedback was discussed this week to ensure the governance system aligns with the community s needs and desires. A consensus is forming around the frame proposed in CIP-1694 and with it, a community-led proposal for MVG will be available to all ada holders.\nWallet providers gathered together in a hybrid hackathon to review CIP-95 this week. CIP-95 proposes mechanisms that empower ada holders with voting capabilities. This proposal fundamentally elevates wallet providers to an integral infrastructure provider for the Cardano ecosystem. They are a key enabler for community members to express their democratic consent for governance actions.\nAs CIP-1694 moves to its final form, the community will have the opportunity to vote on whether this MVG is an acceptable way to move forward together. Several voting opportunities will be presented ensuring the community continues to guide the governance mechanism that best represents the community's needs. This represents a powerful option for the crucial advancement of participatory governance within the Cardano ecosystem.\nLastly, Intersect was announced this week, as a key institution for the ecosystem, bringing together companies, developers, individuals, and other ecosystem participants to shape and drive the future development of Cardano. It will be a steward of the underlying blueprints and technology for the community beginning with the Cardano node, core Cardano libraries and components required to operate the protocol, and all of its accompanying documentation, knowledge, and contributors.\nAs such Intersect will be an administrator of processes that govern the continued roadmap and development of the Cardano platform and protocol.\nAll participants in the Cardano ecosystem are welcome to become Intersect members. Made up of a distributed group of participants, including the foremost experts on Cardano and current ecosystem contributors, Intersect will facilitate healthy discussions and sound decision-making amongst its members, and the community at large, to uncover pain points, while championing successes.

    "prompt": "Weekly development report as of 20230630?",
    "completion": "This week, the core technology teams continued working on node, networking, consensus, and ledger components.\nThe consensus team working on the Genesis implementation continued to engage with the researchers, which resulted in various simplifications of the correctness argument for the historical Genesis window. They also decided on an approach for a syncing node to decide that it is (no longer) caught up. This functionality was requested by the networking team.\nThe team working on the UTXO-HD implementation ran ad-hoc benchmarks that showed performance issues, which are being investigated. They also merged several improvements required for the first UTXO-HD release, and added a package for easing integration with other downstream components.\nRegarding our support activities, we integrated the latest Ledger changes into Consensus in preparation for node 8.2 release.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Lace teams made progress on a tool to simulate a multi delegation wallet by testing different coin-selection algorithms.\nAlso, a new cardano-js-sdk has been integrated, and all necessary compatibility changes to support it in the browser have been implemented. They're also working on the creation of new UI components for the multi-delegation flow, and have fixed some bugs related to HD wallet.\nAdditionally, the team is working on DApp connection improvements, and have also begun integrating Posthog for analytics events.\nFinally, they're preparing the next release of Daedalus to support updated voter registration for Catalyst Fund10, and have almost finished a workaround for responsiveness when the Lace browser extension is resized.\nThe Adrestia team focused on updating cardano-wallet to support node v.8.1.1 and updating GHC to 9.2.8, while also progressing enhancements to the DB layer.\nThis week, the Plutus Tools team worked mostly on Marconi for sidechain. They fixed a few discrepancies between Marconi s JSON answers and the specification (PR-79), added some newly requested fields (PR-78), cleaned up the logging (PR-81) and fixed some bugs (PR-76, PR-81).\nOn the plutus-apps side, they continued refactoring to reduce the dependencies of the node-emulator (PR-1091), and reviewed & merged the first external contribution in a few months (PR-1092).\nThe Plutus Core team worked on finishing off the changes to builtins in the metatheory started last week (a prerequisite for making the builtins machinery of Plutus faster and simpler): PR. They also worked to finish off an optimization speeding up on-chain decoding of variables: PR.\nAdditionally, they worked on improving accuracy of benchmarks: PR, adding useful constants related to BLS builtins to the standard library of Plutus Tx: PR, resolving issues with continuous integration: PR, and adding BLS builtins to the specification: PR.\nThe Marlowe teams had a busy week. They added the HTTP SSE server for Marlowe transactions (PLT-6224; PR: #610) and also added starter-kit lesson on CIP-30 (PLT-6336; PR: #21). They also implemented batching of Marlowe transaction responses (PLT-6327; Commits: 1) and a random contract generator for demonstration (PLT-6302; PR: #617).\nMarlowe Runtime\nThe Marlowe Runtime team fixed an incompatibility between integration tests and safety checks (PLT-5817; Commits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Also, tags now allow metadata longer than 64 characters. (PLT-6076; PR: #627).\nThey also added a Status API to Marlowe Runtime (PLT-5378; PR: #621), created Marlowe Runtime all-in-one executable (PLT-6179; PR: #609), added marlowe-cli analyze functions inside Marlowe Runtime / Web server (PLT-3564; PR: #622), added analysis timeout parameter to marlowe-tx (PLT-6073; Commits: 1), and also added safety report information to Runtime CLI create command (PLT-6072; Commits: 1).\nFinally, they integrated safety report information into REST API (PLT-6071; Commits: 1) and added a safety report to Create command (PLT-6070; Commits: 1, 2, 3, 4)\nMarlowe Explorer\nThe Marlowe Explorer team added a skin to transaction detail in Marlowe Explorer (PLT-6159; PR: #49) and also to contract view in Marlowe Explorer (PLT-6156; PR: #47).\nThey also split the transaction page in two and add skin to transaction index in Marlowe Explorer (PLT-6158 and PLT-6157; PR: #48)\nThis week, the Hydra team shared progress updates during the monthly review meeting and began experimenting on a preview network with the new commit from external wallet feature.\nThis week, the Mithril team completed the design of the signer deployment models for the SPOs to run Mithril on their Cardano mainnet infrastructure, and implemented the associated Mithril Relay in the Mithril networks. They kept working on the design and implementation of a simple stress test tool for benchmarking the aggregator. They also worked on implementing a new tool command in the aggregator, and its first sub-command that helps avoiding the need for re-genesis of the certificate chain when the structure of the certificate is upgraded. Additionally, they worked on implementing some monitoring for the Mithril infrastructure, and worked on a retry mechanism for the artifacts creation of the aggregator.\nmainnet\nFinally, the team fixed a bug related to the computation of the master certificate of an epoch that prevented the aggregator from resuming signing certificates when a re-genesis occurred during an already certified epoch.\nThis week in Voltaire, conversations continued on CIP-1694 to establish an initial Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) framework. This framework is crucial for the advancement of participatory governance within the Cardano ecosystem. By collecting feedback from community members, diverse viewpoints can be incorporated to ensure the governance system aligns with the community s needs and desires.\nThe following workshops, hosted this week, yielded some valuable feedback:\nWilliamsburg, New York, U.S. by quantumplation#3141\nLagos, Nigeria by Ubiodee#9502\nLondon, England by Chris [UPSTR]#5848 (7/1)\nSao Paulo, Brazil by Ot vio - CardanoFeed.com#5640 (7/1)\nVirtual by Seo4u#6254\nVirtual by jerrybnj#9863 (7/1)\nCheck out workshops happening near you and join the conversations.\nCIP-30 and CIP-95 are mechanisms proposed in Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) to empower ada holders with voting capabilities. These proposals, once implemented by wallet providers, will enable community members to express their democratic consent for governance actions.\nIt's essential for community members to actively participate in providing feedback for CIP-1694 and CIP-95. By voicing opinions and suggestions, you can help shape the future of governance within Cardano. This collaborative approach ensures that the governance mechanisms implemented best represent the community's needs.\nThis week in Project Catalyst, the team presented the voter registration and the community review registration processes at this week s town hall. Guides to both of these processes can be found in the Catalyst gitbook. Finally, some of the Catalyst projects presented some of the great work they have been doing to impact the community.

Note that peer sharing is an experimental feature that is currently disabled until the implementation of Genesis and Eclipse Evasion is complete.\nThe team also made progress in reviewing Eclipse Evasion, fixed some bugs in local root peers, and resumed working on dynamically enabling block forging, which will enable the release of P2P for block-producing nodes.\nFinally, the team prepared cardano-ping and cardano-cli ping releases.\nThe consensus team had a productive meeting with IOG researchers to discuss the transition between Byron and TPraos eras when Genesis is rolled out. They agreed that era checkpointing is not necessary for the MVP and are currently assessing the threat that historical short forks pose for Genesis. Additionally, they are collaborating further with researchers to ensure that when Genesis is implemented, there will be a bound on how long an adversary can delay the overall sync time.\nIn terms of development, the team has been working on the UTXO HD feature. They rebased the prototype branch onto the latest ouroboros-consensus main branch and integrated it with cardano-node 8.1.1-pre. As a result, the recently released mempool fairness fix is now incorporated into UTXO-HD. They successfully ran a UTXO-HD-enabled node and addressed a race condition in the prototype. Additionally, they started conducting UTXO-HD ad-hoc benchmarks for cardano-node, which revealed a performance regression in the network component when using GHC-9.2/9.4. They are currently working on resolving this issue.\nIn terms of support activities, the team released fs-sim-0.2.0.0 and is in the process of preparing the node v.8.2 release.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Lace team implemented Brave support in Lace v.1.1.1.

    "completion": "This week, the core technology teams released node v.8.0.0. This release brings a new governance action that facilitates conducting on-chain SPO polls, a fairness improvement in the mempool logic, and query commands that allow inspection of metrics and data in the mempool. Additionally, the CLI command query tip now provides more detailed output. Another enhancement is the introduction of versioned serialization formats for the ledger.\nThe ledger team primarily focused on improving the Conway ledger era and node integration. Regarding Conway, they accomplished a significant structural change that now permits the parameterization of delegation certificates by era. This change has introduced new certificates for the first time since Shelley. They also continued developing constraint-based generators that would be utilized for property tests in the Conway era. Specifically, these generators will be able to produce a complete ledger state and a transaction that is balanced according to the ledger state.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Daedalus team worked on the creation of a proxy server to improve reliability of the currency conversion feature.\nThe team released Lace 1.1.0, which brings several improvements and features for a better user experience. Users can now recover their wallets using a 12- or 15-word recovery phrase, and view the prices of their available native tokens. Pricing is now displayed in 11 fiat currencies with compact number notation for large numbers. Users can switch between networks with ease and regain access to their wallets using a recovery phrase if they forget their password. Finally, a bug fix ensures that NFTs display correctly in the Tokens list and NFT gallery.\nThe team also continued working on the Lace desktop development. They started defining ways for introducing Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet support in cardano-js-sdk to allow Daedalus users to import multi-address wallets into Lace. They also worked on the definition of UI/UX of the multi-delegation page on Lace, and on multi-browser support for Brave, Edge, and Safari.\nThe Adrestia team worked on separating the balance TX library, and also did some database enhancements. The team is now preparing to move into MBO repo and finishing the multi-signature wallet delegation functionality.\nFinally, they are updating cardano-wallet to support node 8.0.x.\nThis week, the Plutus tools team continued documenting the marconi-sidechain architecture, worked on profiling performance regression with the address-utxo indexer, and verified the correctness of indexed Epoch-StakePoolDelegationDistribution. Finally, they continued working on the redesign of resuming capabilities to resolve the encountered issues. The Plutus core team made some improvements to the Plutus Tx standard library, significantly boosting the efficiency of a number of functions that operate on lists.\nThe Marlowe team added library functions for contracts safety checks, ran QA testing of the Marlowe starter kit, and automated the testing of various REST scenarios. They also paginated queries for fetching transactions from Marlowe Runtime by Marlowe Explorer, fixed the tag type to match JSON format used by Runtime in the Explorer, and tested individual CLI features.\nThis week, the Mithril team released a new 2318.0 distribution that implements the last migration phase of the aggregator stores and embeds the bug fix for the signer registration. They also completed the implementation of the interfaces defined to provide certification for the immutable full snapshot of Cardano files and Mithril stake distribution. Additionally, they continued implementing the mechanism to sign generic types of data in the aggregator and the signer.\nFinally, the team worked on preparing the roadmap toward releasing a Mithril network on mainnet, and started designing an on-chain decentralized signer registration process.\nFollowing on from the launch of a global workshop grant fund, Input Output Global (IOG), EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation are thrilled to announce the successful applicants to run a workshop to discuss CIP-1694. Over 75 quality and diverse applications from around the world were received. Submissions from North America, LATAM, and Africa made up over 80 of all applications, evidencing the strength of Cardano s roots and interest in the future of on-chain governance.\nThe workshops, which will take place from May to July, will explore the latest developments in Cardano's on-chain governance proposed in CIP-1694. The in-person workshops will take place in over 20 locations worldwide, giving attendees the opportunity to network, confer, and collaborate with their local Cardano communities. On top of that, there will be over 25 virtual workshops, further opening opportunities to those who cannot attend in-person.\nAn interactive map and further details are available on Essential Cardano.\nThis week in Project Catalyst, the Catalyst team hosted its 125th town hall.

    "completion": "This week, the networking team worked on the ouroboros-network component. After moving ouroboros-consensus to its own repository, the team made ouroboros-network compatible with GHC v.9.4 and v.9.6 and made the cardano-client library independent of ouroboros-consensus-diffusion. They also prepared the release of network packages for the upcoming cardano-node-8.0. These updates are expected to improve the overall performance and stability of the network.\nOver the past two weeks, the consensus team has made significant progress in the Genesis design. The team discovered that the BlockFetch logic may not require modification for Genesis, though this still needs to be verified. In addition, they began creating a DoS mitigation handbook and updated the conceptual component diagram to guide the Genesis design. Collaborating with IOG researchers, they focused on the Limit on Patience attack vector, work on which is ongoing. They sketched a design to decouple the CPU load of the node from its responsiveness to the socket and worked with the networking team to reduce the performance impact of the BlockFetch decision logic.\nThe team also migrated the consensus code to a new repository, splitting it from the ouroboros-network repository, and released consensus v.0.6. Finally, they merged the mempool fairness improvement to the main branch, and worked on documentation improvements. For more details, see this update.\nouroboros-network\nThe DB Sync team worked on a schema change to enhance UTXO query speed and benchmarked it to ensure it is effective. They also optimized rewards performance and worked on improving epoch calculations by introducing a cache to reduce resource usage. Additionally, the team evaluated risks related to UTXO-HD integration and worked on two feature requests: splitting the tx_out to an address table and pruning consumed entries from the tx_out table.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Daedalus team updated some libraries and integrated the latest cardano-wallet v.2023-04-14 and cardano-node v.1.35.4.\nThe team continued working on the Lace desktop development. They focused on improving the user experience by enhancing the settings page, embedding DApp rendering, and updating the sidebar. Additionally, the team added new features to the DApp autoconnection functionality.\nThe Adrestia team worked on the community feedback following the Lace launch, and are now preparing the first big cardano-js-sdk and Lace update.\nWork is ongoing on extracting the transaction balancing library and wrapping up the multi-signature wallet delegation functionality.\nThis week, the Plutus tools team started documenting the Marconi sidechain architecture and worked on profiling performance regression with the UTXO address indexer. Additionally, they verified the correctness of the indexed Epoch-StakePoolDelegationDistribution and redesigned the resuming capabilities, taking into account the issues encountered with the current design. The Plutus core team continued to work on delivering sums-of-products, and merged the plutus-ir and plutus-tx parts of the implementation. They also added the case-of-known-constructor optimization to the Plutus Tx compiler.\nEpoch-StakePoolDelegationDistribution\nThe Marlowe team worked on the Merkleization formalization by adding the bases theory, reorganized Isabelle semantic theory into literate programming, and refactored the guarantees chapter to the specification. The team also updated the Isabelle version to the 2022 release and added more scenarios for the Swap example along with withdrawal support to runtime tests.\nThe Hydra team conducted an April review meeting and published the April report where the team summarizes their monthly progress and takes a look at further development goals. They also updated the specification on both the repository and the website, resolved some user issues, and fixed the TUI peer list. Additionally, the team updated several dependencies, hosted a Twitter space on auction use cases, and addressed the rollback bug by running tests and implementing a solution.\nThis week, the Mithril team completed the implementation of the new certifier service of the aggregator. They also finished implementing the interfaces defined to provide certification for the fully immutable Cardano files snapshot and the Mithril stake distribution. Additionally, they have completed the refactoring of the multi-signer in the aggregator.\nFinally, the team fixed the bug in the signer registration that was responsible for gaps during the signature phase for some signers, and they upgraded the Cardano node used in the Mithril testnets and devnet to v.1.35.7.\nThis week, the conversations on CIP-1694 are about to go global. Applications for funding to host a workshop on Cardano s on-chain governance proposal (as described in CIP-1694) closed on Monday. There have been over 75 applications across the planet, with both virtual and in-person meets on the table. Shortly, Essential Cardano will release an update detailing all the workshops and how people can attend.\nIn other news, the Member-Based Organization (MBO) has recently published an update to progress with more details on what the MBO will orchestrate across the Cardano ecosystem. The MBO will be a home for the blockchain s future development and an aggregation point for community governance.\nFocussing on five pillars, the MBO will:\nSupport the community to develop the ecosystem by hosting developer-focused conferences, hackathons, and events.\nAdministrate and champion Cardano s community-led governance implemented by CIP-1694.\nCoordinate delivery of the community approved Cardano technical roadmap.\nCoordinate the routine maintenance of Cardano for system stability.\nCoordinate open source development of core technologies for Cardano.\nRead more and express your early interest to join!\nThis week in Project Catalyst, a number of teams presented their projects to the community during the Catalyst town hall.

    "prompt": "From Classic to Chronos the implementations of Ouroboros explained?",
    "completion": "Author:\nOlga Hryniuk - Technical Writer\nPublished on IOHK.io: June 3rd, 2022\nThis post is an updated version of the original (created by Kieran Costello) that has been updated to cover new protocol versions.\nSummary:\nOuroboros is the consensus protocol of Cardano. Here, we explain what it does and how it s evolving\nArticle:\nYou have probably heard a lot about Ouroboros: the ground-breaking proof-of-stake consensus protocol used by Cardano. Developed as a more energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to proof of work, upon which earlier cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and, currently, Ethereum are built, Ouroboros was the first blockchain consensus protocol to be developed through peer-reviewed research.\nLed by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias of the University of Edinburgh, Ouroboros and its subsequent implementations provide a new baseline to solve some of the world s greatest challenges, securely and at scale.\nYet recognition begins with education. This article presents an overview of how Ouroboros works. It examines the tangibles and covers what each implementation introduces, to further the community s understanding of the protocol, and illustrates why it s such a game-changer. A detailed analysis of each implementation can be found in the corresponding papers below. For a broad-stroke explanation of Ouroboros and its implementations, however, read on.\nIt s reasonable to assume that anybody new to the space might be confused by the term 'consensus protocol'. Put simply, a consensus protocol is the system of laws and parameters that govern the behavior of distributed ledgers: a ruleset by which each network participant plays to reach an agreement with everyone else.\nPublic blockchains aren t controlled by any single, central authority. Instead, a consensus protocol is used to allow distributed network participants to agree on the history of the network captured on the blockchain to reach a consensus on what has happened, and continue from a single source of truth.\nThat single source of truth provides a single record. This is why blockchains are sometimes referred to as trustless: instead of requiring participants to trust one another, trust is built into the protocol. Unknown actors may interact and transact with each other without relying on an intermediary to mediate, or for there to be a prerequisite exchange of personal data.\nOuroboros is a proof-of-stake protocol, which is distinct from proof of work. Rather than relying on 'miners' to solve computationally complex equations to create new blocks and rewarding the first to do so proof of stake selects participants (in the case of Cardano, stake pools) to create new blocks based on the stake they control in the network.\nNetworks using Ouroboros are many times more energy-efficient than those using proof of work and, through Ouroboros, Cardano is able to achieve unparalleled energy efficiency. As of 2022, Bitcoin, for example, requires 204.50 TWh per year which is comparable to the power consumption of Thailand. Ouroboros, on the other hand, runs a Raspberry Pi, which has a power consumption of 15 to 18W (watts). The resulting difference in energy use can be analogized to that between a household and a country: one can be scaled to the mass market; the other cannot.\nNow, let s take a closer look at how the Ouroboros protocol works, and what each new implementation adds.\nLet s start with Ouroboros: the first implementation of the Ouroboros protocol, published in 2017. This first implementation (referred to as Ouroboros Classic) laid the foundations for the protocol as an energy-efficient rival to proof of work, introduced the mathematical framework to analyze proof of stake, and introduced a novel incentive mechanism to reward participants in a proof-of-stake setting.\nMore than this, however, what separated Ouroboros from other blockchains, and, specifically, proof-of-stake protocols was its ability to generate unbiased randomness in the protocol s leader selection algorithm, and the subsequent security assurances that provided. Randomness prevents the formation of patterns and is a critical part of maintaining the protocol s security. Whenever a behavior can be predicted, it can be exploited and though Ouroboros ensures transparency, it prevents coercion. Significantly, Ouroboros was the first blockchain protocol to be developed with this type of rigorous security analysis.\nA comprehensive explanation of how Ouroboros works can be found in its research paper. Ouroboros divides time on Cardano into epochs where each epoch is divided into slots. A slot is a short period of time in which a block can be created and grouping slots into epochs is central to adjusting the leader election process to the dynamically changing stake distribution.\nCentral to Ouroboros design is that it must retain its security in the presence of attacks. As such, the protocol has built-in tolerance to prevent attackers from propagating alternative versions of the blockchain and assumes that an adversary may send arbitrary messages to any participant at any time. In fact, the protocol is guaranteed to be secure in the so-called synchronous setting (that is, with strong guarantees on message delivery times) so long as more than 51 of the stake is controlled by honest participants (that is, those following the protocol).\nA slot leader is elected for each slot, who is responsible for adding a block to the chain and passing it to the next slot leader. To protect against adversarial attempts to subvert the protocol, each new slot leader is required to consider the last few blocks of the received chain as transient: only the chain that precedes the prespecified number of transient blocks is considered settled. This is also referred to as the settlement delay. Among other things, this means that a stakeholder can go offline and still be synced to the blockchain, so long as it s not for more than the settlement delay.\nWithin the Ouroboros protocol, each network node stores a copy of the transaction mempool where transactions are added if they are consistent with existing transactions and the blockchain. The locally stored blockchain is replaced when the node becomes aware of an alternative, longer valid chain.\nThe drawback of Ouroboros Classic was that it was susceptible to adaptive attackers a significant threat in a real-world setting that was resolved with Ouroboros Praos and had no secure way for a new participant to bootstrap from the blockchain, which was resolved with Ouroboros Genesis.\nOuroboros BFT\nOuroboros BFT came next, derived as a simple special case from the analysis of Classic. Ouroboros BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) is a simple protocol that was used by Cardano during the Byron reboot, which was the transition of the old Cardano codebase to the new. Ouroboros BFT helped prepare Cardano s network for Shelley s release and, with that, its decentralization.\nRather than requiring nodes to be online all of the time, Ouroboros BFT assumed a federated network of servers and synchronous communication between the servers for building the blockchain. In this federated setting, it is a consensus protocol that is attractive due to its simplicity and deterministic nature. It is worth noting that BFT required a larger fraction of honest parties than other Ouroboros versions.\nOuroboros Praos builds upon and provides substantial security and scalability improvements to Ouroboros Classic.\nAs with Ouroboros Classic, Ouroboros Praos processes transaction blocks by dividing chains into slots, which are aggregated into epochs. Unlike Ouroboros Classic, however, Praos is analyzed in a semi-synchronous setting and is secure against adaptive attackers.\nIt assumes two possibilities: that adversaries can delay honest participant messages for longer than one slot, and that an adversary may send arbitrary messages to any participant at any time.\nThrough private-leader selection and forward-secure, key-evolving signatures, Praos provides better epoch randomness and ensures that a strong adversary cannot predict the next slot leader and launch a focused attack (such as a DDoS attack) to subvert the protocol. Praos is also able to tolerate adversarially-controlled message delivery delays and gradual corruption of individual participants in an evolving stakeholder population, which is critical for maintaining network security in a global setting, provided that an honest majority of stake is maintained.\nThen, there is Ouroboros Genesis. Genesis further improves upon Ouroboros Praos by adding a novel chain selection rule, which enables parties to bootstrap from a genesis block without, significantly, the need for trusted checkpoints or assumptions about past availability. Genesis also provides proof of the protocol s Universal Composability, which demonstrates that the protocol can be composed with other protocols in arbitrary configurations in a real-world setting, without losing its security properties. This significantly contributes to its security and sustainability, and that of the networks using it.\nOuroboros Crypsinous\nOuroboros Crypsinous equips Genesis with privacy-preserving properties. It is the first formally analyzed privacy-preserving proof-of-stake blockchain protocol, which achieves security against adaptive attacks while maintaining strong privacy guarantees by introducing a new coin evolution technique relying on SNARKs and key-private forward-secure encryption. Crypsinous isn t currently planned to be implemented on Cardano, but it can be used by other chains for increased privacy-preserving settings.\nLast but not least is Ouroboros Chronos. Chronos achieves two goals: first, it shows how blockchain protocols can synchronize clocks securely via a novel time synchronization mechanism and thereby become independent of external time services. Second, it is a cryptographically secure blockchain protocol that additionally provides a cryptographically secure source of time to other protocols. In short, Chronos makes the ledger more resistant to attacks that target time information.\nFrom an application point of view, Chronos can dramatically boost the resilience of critical telecommunications, transport, and other IT infrastructures that require the synchronization of local time to a unified network clock that has no single point of failure.\nOuroboros, named after the symbol of infinity, is the backbone of the Cardano ecosystem. The protocol serves as a foundation and staging point for self-propagating systems that cyclically transform and grow, supplanting existing systems financial and otherwise and disintermediating the power structures upon which they rely. It is the beginning of a new standard, defined not from the center but, instead, from the margins.\nCurrently, Cardano operates based on Ouroboros Praos. Genesis is being implemented for 2022 after which the ledger will be upgraded to support Ouroboros Chronos.\nIts future is as its past: a tireless effort to explore, iterate, optimize, and drive positive change through rigorous research. Each step in Ouroboros journey is a new evolution, which takes us closer to the vision of a fairer, securer, and more sustainable world.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Implementing Hydra Heads the first step towards the full Hydra vision?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nMatthias Benkort\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: February 3, 2022\nSummary:\nThe Hydra Head, the first in a suite of protocols, is an important element of Cardano s scaling journey. Let s see how it fits into the bigger picture. And maybe bust some myths\nArticle:\nWe ve done the science and the theory. We have laid the foundations for a scalable, versatile, and high-throughput blockchain. Now it s time for steady growth and system enhancements. With the goal of creating an optimized ecosystem to support and foster decentralized applications (DApps) development, Cardano is in the foothills of the Basho phase. With smart contracts already in place, Basho is all about scaling and network optimization. The Hydra protocol family is a key component of this.\nWe have talked about Hydra before. Hydra is an ensemble of layer 2 solutions designed to address network security and scalability capabilities. Originally conceived within the work of the Ouroboros research team, it has in fact forged an independent path since the original paper's publication. Hydra offers increased throughput, minimized latency, and cost-efficient solutions without substantial storage requirements. The Hydra Head protocol was already shaping up back in 2020 and since then our thinking has developed particularly throughout this early implementation and proof of concept stage. Building on that initial idea, the Hydra Head protocol matured into a proof of concept and has continued to do so as we have headed toward a more defined implementation for the testnet MVP.\nWe have seen plenty of excitement (great!) along with misconceptions and misunderstandings (not so great). Most of these have arisen from the idea statement, rather than the actual protocol implementation and some of our earlier blogs have perhaps contributed to these misunderstandings. But the Hydra Head protocol isn t solely about SPO implementation as much as the theoretical 1 million TPS which needs to be caveated and better explained.\nIn this article, we the Hydra engineering team outline our current progress, our approach, and our near and long-term roadmap. We ll demystify some misconceptions, clarify the benefits and reflect on development challenges.\nLet s first re-introduce Hydra Heads, which involve not only a robust networking layer between peers and an integrated Cardano ledger but also, several on-chain scripts (smart contracts) that drive the lifecycle of a Hydra Head.\nA Hydra Head is a provably secure isomorphic state channel. Simply put, it is an off-chain mini-ledger between a restricted set of participants, which works similarly (albeit significantly quicker) to the on-chain main ledger.\nThe first thing to understand is that a channel is a communication path between two or more peers. To be part of a Head means being one of those peers. Channels form isolated networks that can evolve in parallel to the main network. On these alternative networks, participants follow a different, simpler, consensus algorithm: everyone needs to agree on all transactions flowing through. A consequence of this is that, as a participant, I cannot lose money I haven't explicitly agreed to lose. Why? Because any valid transaction requires my explicit approval.\nWhen forming a Head, participants may commit funds to it. This means moving funds on-chain to a script address that locks them under specific rules. The script guarantees safe execution of the protocol on-chain, and in particular, that participants cannot cheat one another. At any time, however, any participant may decide to quit the Head by closing it. In this case, all participants walk away with the latest state they had agreed to off-chain, on their parallel network.\nThink of Heads as private poker tables where participants bring their own chips to play the game. Participants can play for as long as they want. If someone doesn't play, then the game doesn't progress. Yet, participants are still free to walk away with their chips. If they do so, the game ends with the current wealth distribution.\nFigure 1*. Hydra Head (simplified) life cycle*\nThe dealer at the table (the on-chain script) ensures that people play by the rules and don't cheat. In the end, there are as many chips out as there were chips in, but they may have been redistributed during the course of the game. While the final result is known outside of the table, the history of all actions that happened during the game is only known to the participants.\nThis protocol is one of a whole suite of protocols that we usually refer to as Hydra . The current engineering effort is focused on implementing the Hydra Head protocol as published in Hydra: Fast Isomorphic State-Channels by Chakravarty et al.\nAround the end of 2021, Maxim Jourenko, Mario Larangeira, and Keisuke Tanaka published an iteration on top of Hydra Head called Interhead Hydra: Two Heads are Better than One. This iteration defines a method for interconnecting two Heads together enabling, in the long run, the creation of a network of interconnected Hydra Heads. Previously, there were mentions of other protocols like the Hydra Tail . However, those are still under research, along with new ideas coming from the recent work on the Hydra Head protocol.\nRecently we have seen a lot of commentary positioning Hydra as the ultimate solution for Cardano scalability. For sure, Hydra Heads make for a strong foundation to build a scalability layer for Cardano. They are an essential building block that leverages the power of the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model to enable more complex solutions on top. They are a critical element of the scalability journey, but they are not the final destination.\nBefore talking about scalability metrics, let s clarify a few things about transactions per second (TPS). Amongst all those available, TPS is probably the least meaningful metric to consider as a means of comparison. Transactions come in different shapes and sizes. While this is true for Cardano, it s even more essential when comparing two drastically different systems.\nThink about a highway and vehicles. One can look at how many Vehicles Per Second (VPS) the highway can handle between two points. Yet, if there s no common definition of what a vehicle is, then comparing 10 VPS to 100 VPS is seemingly meaningless. If the 10 vehicles in the example refer to massive cargo trucks, does it make sense to compare them to 100 scooters in terms of their delivery capabilities? The same applies to transactions. A transaction carrying hundreds of native assets and outputs is certainly not the same as a single ada payment between two actors.\nUsing TPS as a metric within the same context (for example, to compare two versions of the Cardano node) is meaningful. Using it as a means of comparison between blockchains isn t.\nWith that in mind, we suggest looking not only at throughput but also at finality and concurrency as important metrics to consider and discuss scalability:\nthroughput: the volume of data processed by a system in a given amount of time\nfinality: the time it takes for the result of some action to become immutable and true for everyone in the system\nconcurrency: the amount of work that can be done by different actors without blocking each other\nHydra Heads excel in achieving near-instant finality within a Head. The process of setting up and closing a Head can take a few blocks, but once established, transactions can flow rapidly across collaborative participants. Since Hydra Heads also use the EUTXO model, they can process non-conflicting transactions concurrently, which coupled with good networking allows for optimal use of the available resources. The first simulations of the Hydra Head protocol back in 2020 suggested a very promising 1000 TPS . We are now in the process of benchmarking the real implementation in terms of throughput and finality.\nOne caveat: a Hydra Head is a very local construct within a small group of participants. These groups will initially be independent and thus, looking at the sum of their individual metrics as a whole is misleading. Since groups are independent and can be independently created at will, it is easy to reach any figure by just adding them up: ten, a thousand, one million, one billion, and so on.\nConsequently, while the first version of the Hydra Head protocol will allow for small groups of participants to scale up their traffic at a low cost, it won t immediately offer a solution for global consumer-to-consumer (micro) payments or NFT sales. Why? Because the consensus inside a Head requires every participant to react to every transaction. And a single head doesn't scale infinitely with the number of participants, at least not without some additional engineering efforts. For example, the interconnection of Hydra Heads paves the way for larger networks of participants, effectively turning local Heads into a global network. We are exploring several other ideas to extend the Hydra Head protocol to broaden the set of use cases it can cover. We will talk more about that in the next sections and in future updates.\nSo when are Heads useful? Hydra Heads shine when a small group of participants needs to process many quick interactions. Imagine, for example, a pay-per-use API service, a bank-to-bank private network, or a fast-paced auction between a seller and a small group of bidders. The use cases are plenty and take various forms. Some of them may be long-running Heads going for months, whereas others may be much shorter and only last a few hours.\nOur initial Hydra research in 2020 suggested stake pool operators (SPOs) as likely candidates for running Hydra Heads. However, as the Hydra Head protocol has been researched and built as a proof of concept, we can firmly state that it is a misunderstanding to say that only SPOs should run a Hydra Head to ensure ledger scalability. In fact, SPOs have no intrinsic interest in opening Heads between each other without a reason to transact (tipping or trading NFTs, for example). In a way, SPOs are like any other actor when it comes to the Hydra Head protocol. They can be a participant and open up Heads with other peers, but so can anyone interested.\nAdmittedly, SPOs are good in operating infrastructure and can be some of the first users running instances of the Hydra Head protocol. Still, this only allows participating SPOs to transact with one another, which limits use cases for end-users. Only advanced layer 2 system designs like the Interhead Hydra protocol require intermediaries to run infrastructure to the benefit of end-users. In fact, we anticipate that one likely setup for Hydra Heads will be providing users with managed Hydra Heads as a service (HaaS). We can achieve this without giving up custody of funds by running the infrastructure on the behalf of end-users, who generally have neither the interest nor the technical skills to maintain such infrastructure.\nThis is very similar to the current operational model of light wallets and light wallet providers that are much more likely to be running Hydra Heads in the long run. Imagine a network composed of the top light wallet providers within the Cardano ecosystem. Such providers can then facilitate instant and cheap payments between their users while ensuring overall trust.\nWe also envision that services for developers and DApp providers will be likely candidates for running Hydra Heads. Indeed, DApp developers require access to on-chain information. For that, developers may rely on online services that provide adequate interfaces and typically charge monthly usage fees. Hydra Heads can improve this process by enabling a more decentralized business model with pay-per-use API calls between service providers and DApp developers.\nAs a group of protocols that will be delivered over time, and will involve more elaborated layer 2 system designs on top of the Hydra Head protocol, it is crucial that we engage frequently with developers of the Cardano ecosystem. This is not about a big bang release but rather an iterative release cycle. We need to understand developer challenges, make sure to meet their needs, and ultimately ensure we are building something useful. This is why we are developing Hydra Head as an open-source GitHub project, starting with an early proof of concept last year. Aiming for a regular and frequent release cadence, we released our initial developer preview in September (0.1.0) followed by a second iteration (0.2.0) before Christmas. The next increment (0.3.0) is coming up in February. We follow semantic versioning and each of those pre-releases (0.x.0) adds features that will be available to our partners and early adopters to test out on private and public Cardano testnet(s).\nWe re delighted to announce that our roadmap is now also available on Github! As a means to engage with our community of developers and to be transparent about the course of our development efforts, you will find feature issues, milestones, and project boards available on the Hydra Head repository.\nWhile our focus is on creating meaningful and feature-packed releases as we journey along testnet and later mainnet maturity with version 1.0.0, the roadmap also includes tentative dates. These forecasts stem from both the work accomplished so far and our estimates of the work remaining ahead. We ll reflect on the content and the dates regularly in an agile manner to keep the roadmap as accurate as possible.\nWe will measure our success by how much traffic will be running in Hydra Heads in comparison to the Cardano mainnet. This means that we can t reach our goal without the community, and Hydra can only be successful if it is useful to current and future Cardano users.\nDepending on your time, skills, and expertise, we welcome you to engage with us to share questions, feedback, or contribute to the development effort. This is a stellar opportunity to build a whole ecosystem of layer 2 solutions for Cardano together. The Hydra Head protocol will be the first building block of many advanced solutions to come. At IOG, we have already started working on some of them, but some will inevitably (and fortunately!) be built by the members of our community, which we look forward to supporting.\nWe ll talk about Hydra Heads in more detail during February s mid-month development update. Subscribe to our Youtube channel and come join us!\nI d like to thank Sebastian Nagel, Olga Hryniuk, Mark Irwin, and Tim Harrison for their input and support in preparing this blog post.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Mithril proof of concept is now opensource?",
    "completion": "As Cardano scales, Input Output Global (IOG) engineering teams are working on a range of solutions to boost network performance. Mithril is one such solution, aiming to streamline the speed and efficiency of data synchronization between applications.\nDuring July s 360 show, Arnaud Bailly IOG technical architect shared a Mithril development update.\nBy running a Cardano node, users can interact with the Cardano blockchain in a trustless way. The network combines thousands of nodes into one unified system, where they communicate with other nodes to share information about new blocks and transactions.\nBecause each node holds a full copy of the blockchain, node synchronization takes time each new node needs to download and verify each block. Daedalus, for example, is a full node wallet that downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history. This requires specific software and storage requirements, which also means that it requires more time to synchronize the chain state.\nThe goal of Mithril is to leverage the existing network to provide certified snapshots of all or part of the blockchain state. These snapshots can be useful in different ways. The IOG team has been working on a first use case to leverage Mithril to quickly and efficiently bootstrap a full Cardano node.\nMithril is based on the same concept of stake that powers the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus protocol. With Ouroboros, stakeholders are elected to produce blocks randomly with a chance proportional to the amount of stake they own or delegate. With Mithril, stakeholders can sign the current ledger state according to a lottery mechanism where a probability to contribute is also proportional to their stake. The signatures generated by the stakeholders are then combined, or aggregated, into a Mithril multi-signature, which can only be produced when a predefined threshold (quorum) of the total stake is contributed. Mithril relies on the uniqueness guarantees provided by underlying cryptographic primitives to secure the lottery process.\nMithril operates on top of the main ledger, which ensures no interference with mainnet operations, and as the signatures created are condensed, it requires minimal extra resources and bandwidth usage for the signing nodes.\nThe peculiarity of Mithril certificates is that they carry the same security properties as Cardano s underlying protocol Ouroboros. The security of Mithril relies primarily on the stake distribution of Cardano itself, without the need for a trusted setup. The Mithril network can achieve the highest level of security as long as all SPOs join the network.\nIOG introduced Mithril during the 2021 Cardano Summit. Since then, the team has made steady development progress.\nThe team worked on the development of the Mithril Core library that implements the full feature cryptographic primitives of the Mithril protocol. They also worked on creating the Mithril Network, which is implemented on top of the Mithril Core library. In the current proof of concept (PoC) paradigm, it is composed of the following components:\nThe Mithril Signer: the node that works transparently on top of the stake pool operator Cardano nodes and individually signs the ledger state.\nThe Mithril Aggregator: the trusted node run by IOG that orchestrates the work of the Mithril Signer nodes and gathers their individual signatures to produce Mithril multi-signatures and their associated certificates. It is also in charge of creating and storing the ledger state snapshot archive.\nThe Mithril Client: the node used to restore a full Cardano node by retrieving a remote snapshot and its certificate chain from a Mithril Aggregator, and by verifying snapshots validity thanks to the Mithril cryptographic primitives.\nCurrently, the team is at the final stages of Mithril Network optimization and testing in its first centralized version (ie running with an IOG-operated Mithril Aggregator). This phase will allow IOG engineers and researchers to work on the release of a more decentralized version of the Mithril Network on the Cardano mainnet (where stake pool operators will also be able to run Mithril Aggregators on their own). New use cases will be further added such as implementing Mithril in light clients and wallets.\nThe Mithril repository is now open-source. If you re interested to find out more, see Mithril proof-of-concept documentation and join this Discord channel for more discussions.\nThis blog post has been prepared in cooperation with Arnaud Bailly and Jean-Philippe Raynaud.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Enhanced Integration of Wrapped Smart Contracts?",
    "completion": "The recent amalgamation of Wrapped Smart Contracts (WSC) within the sophisticated Milkomeda platform marks a monumental development, widening the scope and capabilities for Cardano wallet holders extensively. This advancement enables users to smoothly interact with a plethora of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible decentralized applications (DApps), encompassing a diverse range of domains including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, NFTs, and beyond, all available within the innovative Milkomeda ecosystem. The seamless integration fosters an enriched user experience, allowing Cardano enthusiasts to interact natively with Milkomeda DApps via their Cardano wallets, thus bolstering the Cardano ecosystem in a ground breaking and unique manner.\nBefore the rollout of WSC, migrating assets between a foundational Layer 1 blockchain like Cardano and an advanced Layer 2 solution like Milkomeda was laden with complexity. This intricate process typically encompassed wrapping or bridging assets, meticulous wallet management, and involved numerous other intricate steps.\nMilkomeda s introduction of Wrapped Smart Contracts adeptly mitigates these challenges by offering a harmonious and streamlined user experience between Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains. This approach ensures fluidity and coherence in user journeys across different blockchain layers.\nWrapped Smart Contracts employ smart contracts that, while being deployed on Milkomeda s Layer 2 chain, remain uniquely connected to a user s Cardano Layer 1 address. These contracts serve as virtual accounts, endowed with balances, nonces, and the capability to process signed transactions representing the user.\nWhen interfacing with WSC-enabled DApps, a user s Cardano wallet autonomously generates an EVM-compatible address, thus obviating the necessity to manage additional private keys. This means users can initiate and authenticate Layer 2 transactions employing their native Cardano Layer 1 accounts, circumventing the need for manual bridging of assets or utilizing Ethereum-centric wallets to engage with Milkomeda s DApps. This denotes a substantial enhancement in the user experience for native Cardano users.\nA noteworthy adjunct to this is the incorporation of the Blueshift decentralized exchange (DEX), which features the prominent Cardano Index, a meticulously curated portfolio epitomizing the vitality of the Cardano community. The index aggregates growing projects like Cornucopias ($COPI), NMRK ($NMKR), VyFinance ($VYFI), and Blueshift ($BLUES), acting as a reliable indicator of Cardano s escalating influence in the blockchain sphere.\nThrough WSCs, users acquire the capability to seamlessly interact and endorse the projects within the officially acknowledged Cardano Index, all within a familiar wallet environment.\nThe deployment of Wrapped Smart Contracts on the Milkomeda platform signifies a remarkable stride in ameliorating cross-chain interactions and elevating the user experience for the multitude of Cardano wallet holders. As blockchain ecosystems undergo continuous evolution, such pioneering innovations serve as the foundational elements for an increasingly interconnected and user-centric decentralized landscape.\nWe extend a warm invitation to blockchain enthusiasts to experience the revolutionary Wrapped Smart Contracts first hand. Interested individuals can simply visit our DEX at https://app.blueshift.fi, change the network to Cardano, and connect their favourite Cardano wallet to begin exploring Blueshift and the Cardano Index.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Layer 2 scaling solutions on Cardano.?",
    "completion": "Cardano has officially entered the network expansion phase the Basho Era. Since the beginning of 2022, many improvements have been made, in several previous articles we showed how Cardano s network expansion is divided into 2 parts: on-chain and off-chain.\nOff-chain scaling solutions are often referred to as Layer 2 scaling solutions. Layer 2 is a common name for all technical solutions that are not directly deployed on the main chain (layer 1).\nMainchain Layer 1 (Cardano) is always designed to operate with the original scope of that blockchain, to make it easier to understand we need to return to a fundamental concept which is the blockchain trilemma.\nBlockchain trilemma includes 3 factors: Decentralization, Security, and Scalability. To serve the purpose of each stage of development, each blockchain can change its design and operation to match.\nHowever, it is difficult to increase all 3 factors to the same level at the same time or increase 1 factor excessively compared to the other 2 factors because this will break the stable operating structure that blockchain is being achieved.\nTherefore, to increase gradually, the solution is to improve in part or locally by moving to layer 2.\nThe scalability of a blockchain is evaluated in terms of improving and increasing the throughput of the network to achieve maximum performance based on the system settings at each point in time. Accompanying this is the process of building and upgrading the network at both layer 1 (on-chain) and layer 2 (off-chain).\nWe can take the following example: If we consider a blockchain as a tree, then:\nImproving and upgrading the network in layer 1 is to make the roots of the tree really good. It helps the entire trunk will be grow firmly. It means growing vertically.\nImproving and upgrading the network in layer 2 is the development of good branches and leaves. it means growing horizontally\nLooking at the picture above we can easily distinguish:\nThe blue part: These are the improvements that make Cardano s layer 1 (on-chain) be stronger.\nThe red part: These are the technologies and improvements that make Cardano s layer 2 (off-chain) be more perfect.\nDuring Cardano s platform upgrade roadmap in 2022, we all know what Cardano has been and is doing. Cardano s success is the development and upgrading of its platform in both layer 1 and layer 2 in parallel.\nThis helps Cardano develop a solid platform that is ready to explode for the next stage. However, within the scope of this article, the author only mentions the solution to expand layer 2, so if readers are interested in layer 1, we will discuss it in other articles.\nSo why do we need separate analysis at layer 2?\nThose who love or closely follow the development of Cardano are all too familiar with technologies or terms such as Hydra, Mithril, Mamba sidechain .But there are quite a few people who do not know the true meaning of that separate solution in the most obvious way.\nThis will lead to unnecessary misunderstandings about Cardano s scalability development roadmap.\nA. Scalability and Interoperability\nIf compared with the solution that extends to the entire platform of a blockchain, as above, we have vertical (Layer 1) and horizontal (Layer 2) development.\nThe scalable in Layer 2 is similar, meaning there is also vertical and horizontal growth. Specifically, it is the development of the following two properties:\nScalability: is the ability of the network to grow in terms of transaction speed and number of transactions. In other words, this is an internal expansion of a blockchain or vertical development.\nInteroperability: is the ability of the network of a blockchain to interact and communicate with other blockchains or networks. From there, the power of blockchain can be extended outwardly or horizontally development.\nThese two properties complement each other and have a linear relationship. If the inside is not good, it will limit the development of the outside and vice versa.\nTo increase interoperability:\nDeveloping technologies or frameworks so that projects can build specialized sidechains that connect to other blockchains (EVM sidechain)\nBuilding cross-chain asset transfer bridges from project teams in the ecosystem (ERC-20 converter of Singularity.Net)\nSo we can get a clear picture of Cardano s scaling plans. The mission of increasing scalability Cardano has done very well in accordance with the milestones researched and planned from the years 2018, 2019.\nThe challenge for Cardano right now is to increase interactivity. The main solution for the whole ecosystem at the moment is to build sidechains that are able to connect to other blockchains. Typically, developing EVM sidechain, and in the next article we will learn more about how EVM sidechain has been implemented in the Cardano ecosystem.\nFor Vietnamese, please our live-stream clip for more details\nSource: Cardanolibrary.net - Vcoincheck.io a project sponsored by Project Catalyst.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Native tokens and tools an update?",
    "completion": "The Cardano native tokens feature allows user-defined tokens to be handled by the underlying ledger in the same way as the native ada currency. These user-defined tokens can represent anything from cryptocurrencies to loyalty points or even real-world assets like property or stocks.\nCardano has supported native tokens and multi-asset capability since the Mary hard fork in March 2021. Because the support is built in, no custom code is required to create, transfer or delete tokens. Moreover, because a single Cardano transaction can handle multiple tokens and addresses for a single transaction fee, using and managing native tokens is easier and more cost-effective than dealing with custom tokens on other blockchains.\nNative tokens have played a significant role in the growth and development of the Cardano community. Here are some ways native tokens have helped the Cardano community:\nCreating new use cases: Native tokens allow for the creation of new use cases within the Cardano ecosystem. These tokens can be used for anything from creating loyalty programs to facilitating peer-to-peer transactions.\nIncreased adoption: Native tokens have helped to increase adoption of the Cardano blockchain. The availability of native tokens has attracted more users and developers to the Cardano ecosystem by enabling users to create their own tokens.\nTokenization of assets: Tokenization enables the representation and trading of any digital asset on the Cardano blockchain.\nDeFi: Native tokens have facilitated the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Cardano. By enabling the creation of new tokens, Cardano has created a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (DApps) that provide decentralized financial services.\nThe first native tokens required the use of the Cardano Command Line Interface (Cardano-CLI) to create, transfer and manage them on the Cardano blockchain. Since native tokens have gained in popularity, the Cardano community has risen to the challenge and created a rich variety of tools to extend and enhance the offerings of Input Output Global (IOG).\nThe following products may be offered by third parties, and IOG makes no representation as to their suitability.

    "prompt": "How to choose a Web3 wallet?",
    "completion": "A crypto wallet is designed to manage cryptocurrency. Unlike a traditional wallet that holds banknotes, a crypto wallet does not store digital assets. Rather, it stores the cryptographic keys that are the only way of accessing your assets. Wallet software uses the keys to scan the blockchain for matching wallet addresses and calculate the current balance of digital assets at each address.\nA Web3 wallet is a type of crypto wallet that not only manages cryptographic assets but also connects with decentralized applications (DApps), so that users can access a wide range of new applications, including decentralized exchanges.\nThe Cardano community has created a number of Web3 wallets, and more are being created all the time. For a list that is continually updated, see the wallets page on the Cardano developers website.\nThe keys used in crypto wallets are strings of numbers and letters. They come in pairs; a private key and a public key. A private key is a long, randomly generated number that is mathematically related to a public key, which is a shorter, public-facing alphanumeric string. A public key can be quickly generated from a private key, but it is impossible to reverse the process.\nA public key is used to deposit digital assets into a wallet. Assets can only be withdrawn from a wallet with the correct private key. Tell the world your public key, but the security of your private key is of utmost importance.\nAll wallets have password security at a minimum. The password you use must be unique, strong, memorable for you, and unguessable by anyone else. You should consider using password manager software. If properly set up, these are highly resistant to hacking.\nHardware wallets can offer additional features, including biometrics, a physical button that must be pushed, and a maximum distance between a phone and a wallet.\nWhen you create a wallet, you will often be given a recovery phrase of up to 24 seemingly random words. All your keys and wallet addresses can be rebuilt from that phrase. It needs to have the utmost security, just as if it were your private key.\nCustodial wallets offer convenience because they are typically easier to set up and use than non-custodial wallets. However, with custodial wallets, the private key is held by a third party (the custodian), which means you do not have full control over your funds. Custodial wallets are typically offered by crypto exchanges.\nIf you forget the credentials you use to access your funds, the custodian will usually be able to help. However, you must trust the custodian, and you will be just another unsecured creditor if it goes bankrupt.\nNon-custodial wallets provide greater security but require more effort to set up and manage correctly. If wallet software stops working on your computer or phone, you can use the recovery phrase to set up a new wallet on the same or a different device.\nBeing your own custodian means you are responsible for the security of your funds. Never share your private key or wallet recovery phrase with anyone, and make sure to always install software from a reputable, official site.\nBeing connected to the internet, a hot wallet offers quick access to crypto exchanges and continual updating of the blockchain status. Note that hot wallets require robust security features because they are more open to attacks.\nA cold wallet can be more secure because it is offline until needed. For example, it may look like a USB drive but be protected with security features. It is useful for the long-term storage of assets but is inconvenient if you use the wallet a lot.\nIf you make a paper copy of your private key, that is called a paper wallet and is definitely cold. It is inconvenient, and you have to be aware that the ink can fade or the paper can be destroyed.\nA full node wallet such as Daedalus from Input Output Global (IOG) stores the whole blockchain on a local machine. By running a full node, you contribute to the security of the blockchain, but it needs more resources in terms of memory and processing power, so is not suitable for a phone. Also, it takes a while to start up.\nA light wallet such as Yoroi from Emurgo or Lace from IOG does not keep a local copy of the blockchain. This option means a fast start and low resource usage.\nYou'll also want to ensure your chosen wallet is compatible with the cryptocurrencies you want to use. Some wallets only support specific cryptocurrencies, so make sure your wallet supports the ones you need.\nThe user interface of the wallet is also important. You'll want to choose a wallet that is easy to use and navigate and works in a way that you find appealing and intuitive.\nFor reference, check out the Lace user experience video that aims to make the user's journey as seamless as possible.\nConsider a wallet from a reputable and trustworthy provider. Look for reviews, ratings, and feedback from other users to get an idea of the wallet's reputation.\nUsing some wallets might incur fees, and the underlying blockchain protocol will also charge some fees for every transaction, so you'll want to consider the costs associated with using the wallet.\nConsider the features and functionality of the wallet. When a Web3 wallet is connected with DApps, many features become possible, such as:\nMinting/burning tokens\nSwapping tokens\nStaking tokens\nLending and borrowing tokens\nBuying and selling NFTs from marketplaces\nGaming.\nCheck to see if the features you will use are enabled in the wallet you are interested in.\nDevelopment and community are also important when choosing a wallet. Look for options with an active and supportive community. Regularly updated wallets with new features and improvements will always be relevant.\nAs part of prudent defense-in-depth, some wallet users adopt a hierarchy of wallets:\nA trading wallet used to communicate with exchanges\nA short-term hot wallet\nA cold-storage offline wallet.\nA trading wallet is used to exchange between fiat currency (dollars, pounds, etc) and digital assets. It normally holds a minimum amount of crypto for a term measured in minutes or hours. A short-term wallet holds crypto for days or weeks. Digital assets that matter the most are held in long-term cold storage, possibly in a hardware wallet.\nUltimately, it s important to understand the pros and cons of each type of wallet before making a decision about which one is best for you.\nAnnounced in June 2022, Lace 1.0 is now available. The release follows a development process that involved research, code reviews, and usability tests via beta programs. Lace is easy to use and secure, having passed external audits performed by FYEO, a cybersecurity firm specializing in comprehensive blockchain security audits.\nLace is a light wallet platform, meaning it doesn t need to keep a copy of the whole blockchain to synchronize with the ledger. It is a non-custodial hot wallet, currently implemented for Chromium-based browsers.\nMore than storing keys, Lace has features that let you manage your digital assets, access NFTs, and easily stake your ada, all from one easy-to-use interface. Lace also supports bundled transactions a bundle can have multiple assets and many addresses. It is processed as one transaction for one fee.\nAdd Lace to your browser and enjoy the world of Web3. Additionally, the Lace team would love to hear feedback from its community. You can do so on their Discord channel here.\nNothing in this article is intended to be professional advice, including, without limitation, financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.

    "prompt": "Layer 1 Layer 2 all you need to know?",
    "completion": "When discussing blockchain architecture, the terms 'layer 1' and 'layer 2' are frequently mentioned. These are important concepts that serve two purposes: explain how a blockchain network is built, and provide an easy-to-understand visual representation of what a blockchain network looks like.\nLet's break these ideas down.\nImagine a wedding cake, with different tiers -layers, if you will-, and the figurine of a couple on top. That beautiful cake rests on a solid stand, the base. For all intents and purposes, that robust and solid cake stand is the first layer (layer 1) that supports the cake infrastructure. You can probably see where this is going. In a blockchain, layer 1 is the base network upon which rest layer 2 solutions.\nWith this visual schematic in mind, Cardano is the layer 1 (the base network), which itself includes three independent layers:\nNetwork layer\nConsensus layer\nLedger layer\nNetwork layer\nThis layer maintains the connections between all the distributed nodes in the Cardano network, obtains new blocks from the network as they are produced by block producing nodes, builds newly minted transactions into blocks, and transmits blocks between nodes.\nConsensus layer\nThis layer performs two fundamental functions:\nRunning the Ouroboros consensus protocol. This layer takes decisions like adopting blocks, choosing between competing chains (if there are any), and deciding when to produce blocks of its own; and\nMaintaining all the state that is required to make the decisions taken in the consensus layer.\nLedger layer\nThis layer specifies:\nWhat the state of the ledger looks like; and\nHow the ledger must be updated for each new block.\nThe ledger layer consists exclusively of pure functions that specify the transitions between successive ledger states, as derived from the formal ledger rules, using the Extended UTxO (EUTxO) accounting model. The state transitions are driven by the set of transactions that are contained within the Cardano blocks, and by major events such as epoch boundary transitions.\nThe consensus layer does not need to know the exact nature of the ledger state, nor the contents of the blocks, apart from some header fields required to run the consensus protocol.\nAs a whole, these three layers form the layer 1 solution that is Cardano.\nLook at that wedding cake again. It's big, isn't it, with all those tiers stacked on top of one another. But look at the base, the cake stand. That first layer has certain dimensions and cannot be any bigger. Equally, it needs to be big enough to support the tiers that sit above it. The stuff that rests on it can only be of a certain size, and this is exactly the reason why wedding cakes have multiple tiers. Every tier (think layer) adds something to the base. A new filling, frosting, decoration, etc. In other words, every tier scales the base layer up.\nDecentralized public networks face a similar problem. Just as a cake stand can only fit a finite amount of slices, the base (the layer 1) can only process a certain amount of transactions. If you try adding more slices than the stand cake takes, they will start falling off the edges and the mess will ruin someone's big day. Equally, the nodes in a layer 1 network can only process so many transactions before congestion occurs. As the user base grows, so does the need for more nodes to process transactions. To resolve this problem, the network needs to scale, or else transactions will start falling off the edges, so to speak.\nThere are ways to scale up a layer 1 network. Increasing block size, for example, so that blocks carry more transaction data. Block size was recently increased by 8KB to 72KB (a 12.5 increase). This is one of the ways in which Cardano will scale in 2022.\nReturning to our wedding cake visual, adding tiers not only makes the cake bigger, it also introduces a very useful feature: the ability to make every tier different to the base. We can add different flavors, fillings, designs, and so on, independently of the first layer. To cater for different guests and different preferences. In blockchain, adding a new layer (layer 2) not only allows the layer 1 to scale, it also enables transactions and processes to happen independently of the main chain (layer 1).\nCardano is now into the Basho phase of development, which is all about scaling and optimization. While the network is currently managing demand very effectively, the decentralized application (DApp) ecosystem is growing fast and will continue to place increasing demand on the system. To address this, multiple scalability methods (including layer 1 and layer 2 solutions) are being deployed to Cardano to onboard first hundreds of thousands, then millions of new users.\nBlock size increase\nThe bigger the block, the more transactions it can carry. The very first block minted on Cardano had a size of 665 bytes (0.665KB). Today, blocks are 72KB in size. That s an increase of over 10,000 ! Further increases will be applied over time based on ongoing system monitoring and overall network health.\nPipelining\nImproves block propagation times by coalescing validation and propagation. The goal is for blocks to be propagated to at least 95 of peers within five seconds by reducing the dead time between blocks (the block propagation overhead). This provides the headroom to make more aggressive scaling changes, such as increasing block size/increasing Plutus parameter limits.\nInput Endorsers\nFurther down the line, input endorsers will improve block propagation times and throughput by allowing transactions to be separated into pre-constructed blocks. This improves the consistency of block propagation times and allows higher transaction rates.\nMemory/CPU parameters for Plutus\nMemory usage is more efficient across the chain. Specifically, there are memory improvements in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) handling, stake distribution, live stake distribution and pools, and hash representation.\nPlutus script enhancements\nEven more effective usage of the powerful EUTxO model through smart contract optimization, including:\nReference inputs (CIP-0031) Plutus scripts can inspect transaction inputs without needing to spend them. This means that it is not necessary to create UTXOs simply to inspect the information held by an input.\nPlutus Datums (CIP-0032) Datums can be attached directly to outputs instead of datum hashes. This simplifies how datums are used, as a user can see the actual datum rather than having to supply the datum that matches the given hash.\nScript sharing (CIP-0033) Plutus script references can be associated with transaction outputs, meaning that they can be recorded on-chain for subsequent reuse. It will not be necessary to supply a copy of the script with each transaction, hugely reducing friction for developers. Reusing scripts in multiple transactions significantly reduces transaction sizes, improving throughput and reducing script execution costs.\nNode enhancements\nImprovements to the node will help even distribution of stake and reward computations across the epochs, thus providing greater headroom for block size increases. Also, memory usage is now more efficient. Memory compaction reduces RSS footprint, and memory sharing means we need less data instantiated. Node version 1.34.1, from March 2022, reduces peak load at critical points, including the epoch boundary.\nOn-disk storage\nBy storing portions of the protocol state on disk, nodes will need to hold less in memory, meaning that RAM-constrained systems will be able to run nodes provided they have sufficient storage, and memory won t present a bottleneck to scalability. This will enable significant growth in the blockchain state.\nThe scalability of a distributed system -such as a blockchain- is a complex quandary.\nThere is a general consensus that a 'proper' blockchain system must have three properties: scalability, security, and decentralization. But an equally widespread belief is the so-called trilemma, which dictates that decentralized systems can only provide two of these properties, while sacrificing the third. First postulated by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, the trilemma suggests that developers must always accept a compromise, or a trade-off, when designing blockchain networks. This compromise means one property must 'suffer', for the other two to be possible.\nFor example, the more nodes a network has, the more decentralized it becomes, but it also means that more nodes need to be trustworthy to maintain security. To maintain security, fees must be introduced that would make the cost of a potential attack prohibitively high. Yet, a network must incentivize participation, so costs per node must be relatively low. Also, the very trait of immutability implies that blockchain data will be added for as long as the blockchain exists, but never deleted, which means the blockchain will just keep on growing. Larger network means more computational resources required to maintain performance. Better performance needs better hardware, which means that rewards must be enough to make the investment worthwhile. And so on.\nResolving this trilemma requires a careful and balanced approach, so that all three elements remain in equilibrium.\nIn theory, a blockchain system will keep on growing indefinitely. As more nodes become part of the system, more data and assets will flow, and more transactions will need processing. All this requires computational power and storage. Over time, demand will keep on growing, so the underlying system will need to scale accordingly to prevent a dramatic fall in performance.\nTwo scaling options exist: vertical and horizontal.\nThis technique involves expanding the computational capabilities of individual nodes by adding more memory and better components. In other words, upgrade the network's hardware to achieve better performance overall.\nHaving a network that includes high-performance nodes supports larger block sizes and faster block diffusion, for example. But the downsides are that decentralization will be limited, given the high operating costs, which will make new node operators think twice about joining and thus curtailing the network's expansion. Also, such a network will bring higher costs for validator nodes.\nIn contrast to vertical scaling, horizontal scaling can be achieved in two ways. One, simply by adding more computers (nodes) to the existing network. The rationale here is that, by adding additional nodes, the network becomes capable of processing more transactions.\nAnd two, by using sidechains, which will take some of the computational load off the mainchain, and, as an added advantage, enable customization in the form of different consensus protocols or governance models for example, to suit a particular project or industry. From a security standpoint, sidechains can create a more secure ecosystem by isolating potential threats to the mainchain. If a sidechain becomes compromised in any way, the risk is contained to that sidechain, thus safeguarding the rest of the network.\nBroadly speaking, layer 2 solutions extend the capabilities of an an existing layer 1 chain, often to address scalability issues. By being built on top of an existing blockchain (just as adding a new tier to a wedding cake), layer 2 protocols perform a great deal of processing work that would otherwise happen on the main chain while inheriting the security of the blockchain it is built on top of.\nAn additional, off-chain protocol that works on top of the layer 1 blockchain. Parties can securely transfer funds from the blockchain into an off-chain protocol, settle transactions in this protocol independently of the underlying chain, and safely transfer funds back to the underlying chain as needed. Layer 2 protocols improve overall throughput and scalability because they reduce network congestion.\nSidechains\nAlthough sidechains are not layer 2 solutions, they are defined as a way to enable multiple blockchains to communicate with each other and have one react to events in the other, is a separate blockchain connected to a main blockchain (the 'main' chain, also known as parent chain), through a two-way mechanism (the 'bridge') that enables tokens and other digital assets from one chain to be used in another and results returned to the original chain. Assets can be moved between chains as needed. One single parent chain can have multiple interoperable sidechains connected to it, which may operate in completely different ways. EVM sidechains on Cardano include dcSpark s Milkomeda and IOG s EVM sidechain project.\nHydra\nHydra is the layer 2 scalability solution for Cardano, which aims to increase transaction speed through low latency and high throughput and minimize transaction cost.\nHydra Head is the first protocol of the Hydra family and embodies the foundation for more advanced deployment scenarios relying on isomorphic, multi-party state-channels. By providing more efficient means of processing transactions off-chain for a set of users, while using the main-chain ledger as the secure settlement layer, Hydra Head keeps security guarantees while remaining loosely coupled to the main chain. Not requiring global consensus, it can adapt to a broad range of applications. Also, Hydra Head allows Tx fees, script execution budgets and other protocol parameters to be configured as low or high as needed by the use case. For example, this is crucial to enable microtransactions.\nFurthermore, Hydra Head introduces the concept of isomorphic state channels: that is, to reuse the same ledger representation to yield uniform, off-chain ledger siblings, which we call Heads (hence the Hydra name). Specifically for Cardano, this means that native assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Plutus scripting are available inside each Hydra Head. Isomorphism permits a natural extension of the system, rather than a bolted-on one.\nHydra Heads excel in achieving near-instant finality within a Head. The process of setting up and closing a Head can take a few blocks, but once established, transactions can flow rapidly across collaborative participants. Since Hydra Heads are isomorphic and also use the EUTXO model, they can process non-conflicting transactions concurrently, which coupled with good networking allows for optimal use of the available resources.\nRollups and validiums\nRollups work by converting the layer 1 execution cost (running a smart contract on layer 1) into a layer 1 data cost (storing the data on layer 1). Since data is much cheaper than execution, layer 2 systems typically achieve much lower transaction costs while still inheriting the decentralization and safety of the underlying layer 1 as all data required to reconstruct the layer 2 state is embedded into the underlying chain. Rollups are often paired with a system to cheaply prove the current layer 2 state to the underlying layer 1, typically with fraud proofs ('optimistic rollups') or validity proofs ('ZK rollups'). However, this is not a requirement, as 'sovereign rollups' often contain no such proof. An example of a framework for creating rollups in the Cardano ecosystem is Paima Engine, which settles to dcSpark s Milkomeda, as well as is capable of monitoring certain properties such as NFT ownership changes in the Cardano layer 1.\nSometimes, instead of storing the entire data on layer 1, only hashes of the layer 2 data are stored on layer 1. These are called 'validiums'. Validiums are much cheaper but often require being paired with another storage solution to retrieve the full data ('pre-image') of the hash (such a storage solution is often called a 'data availability layer').\nOff-chain computing\nOffloading some of the computation, for example with Asynchronous Contract Execution (ACE), can drive greater core network efficiency. Transactions occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap transactions via a trust model.\nMithril\nTo achieve greater scalability, it is necessary to address the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of participants. Mithril is an IOG-developed protocol that acts as a stake-based threshold signature scheme allowing for transparent, secure, and lightweight stake leveraging. Mithril will improve chain synchronization while maintaining trust. The result is fast and efficient multi-signature aggregation without compromising security features.\nA blockchain network works in mysterious ways, and some of the concepts surrounding a decentralized ledger ecosystem can be hard to understand.\nNot so layer 1 and layer 2, if you use the layer cake visualization expressed herein.\nLayer 1 (the cake stand) = the robust and secure base network upon which rest layer 2 solutions\nLayer 2 (the cake tiers) = solutions built on top of the base to address inherent limitations\nThis is the simplest way to visualize and understand what layer 1 and layer 2 are.\nCardano is the layer 1 (the base network)\nA layer 2 solution is a structure built on top of a layer 1 chain to address the latter's limitations such as transaction speed issues. Bitcoin's Lightning Network is an example of a layer 2 solution, as is Hydra for Cardano\nThere are two scaling options: vertical and horizontal\nVertical scaling involves expanding the computational capabilities of individual nodes by adding more memory and better components.\nHorizontal scaling can be achieved in two ways. One, simply by adding more computers (nodes) to the existing network, and two, by using sidechains, which will take some of the computational load off the mainchain.\nCardano will see a range of scalability methods implemented throughout 2022/2023\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "A Revolutionary Crosschain PortfolioBased Liquidity Aggregator Exchange for the Crypto World?",
    "completion": "Blueshift is a cross-chain portfolio-based liquidity aggregator and exchange that aims to bring cross-chain swaps and liquidity to the Cardano ecosystem. There are many issues and barriers to gaining mass adoption across the entire cryptocurrency industry and we have a solution to provide cross-chain movement of assets without using bridges and wrapped assets.\nThe widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies relies on the seamless ability to hold, stake, and trade tokens in a convenient, reliable, and efficient manner. While centralized exchanges (CEXs) offer such user experiences, they often compromise the ownership of tokens, leaving users dependent on third parties and vulnerable to various risks. On the other hand, decentralized finance (DeFi) provides true ownership and full utility of tokens through non-custodial wallets and smart contract-based applications (dApps). However, the need for interoperability among different blockchains hinders the broader adoption of DeFi. The crypto industry increasingly focuses on interoperability, enabling blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data, messages, and tokens seamlessly.\nThe DeFi landscape is currently fragmented and isolated, with separate ecosystems on different blockchains. Each ecosystem has its own technological stack, infrastructure, protocols, wallets, and communities, limiting the potential of DeFi. While committed communities thrive within specific ecosystems, the broader adoption of DeFi suffers due to the barriers between these isolated ecosystems. The existing connections between ecosystems are often fragile bridges that enable token transfers through lock/burn- and mint mechanisms, resulting in wrapped and synthetic tokens. However, these bridges have proven less secure and susceptible to attacks, resulting in significant losses. To fully unlock the potential of DeFi, more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly connections are necessary.\nIn addition to fragmentation, the need for interoperability presents liquidity-related challenges. Liquidity is dispersed, meaning only a fraction of assets is accessible to users. Availability depends on the affiliation with specific ecosystems and the preferences of the respective communities. This limitation restricts users' choices to tokens native to a particular blockchain and stablecoins. Moreover, liquidity needs to be more cohesive across different ecosystems, resulting in inefficiencies and obstacles in performing transactions. High fees and processing times further hinder the user experience in DeFi operations.\nFinancial risks arise from the dependency on DEXs, lending protocols, and other projects on the success of their ecosystems. The aggregated liquidity and overall ecosystem support determine the liquidity projects can secure. Technological risks emerge when adopting cross-chain approaches, as they must make decisions regarding the underlying system and the extent of their cross-chain development. Security risks are prevalent due to intermediaries, multiple interfaces, and potential breaches, jeopardizing the safety of funds and sensitive information.\nSolving the challenges of interoperability requires careful trade-offs in terms of generalisability, extensibility, and trustlessness. Generalisability refers to the depth of interoperability, allowing various data transfers between chains beyond just tokens. It enables projects to function and communicate seamlessly, synchronizing data, tokens, smart contracts, and governance models across chains. Extensibility, on the other hand, focuses on the breadth of interoperability, enabling the seamless addition of new chains to an interoperable network. Each chain has its unique architecture and set of players, including bridges, wallets, and protocols. Lastly, trustlessness minimizes intermediaries' involvement in blockchain communication, ensuring users' control over their assets and actions. Reducing intermediaries and interfaces mitigates the risk of breaches and intrusive interferences.\nBlueshift, a cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX), empowers users to trade cryptocurrencies seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks. Built on the well-established Milkomeda platform and connected with its newly developed layer-0 protocol BluesChain built on the Cosmos SDK, Blueshift boasts cross-chain capabilities that facilitate efficient liquidity movement, streamlined swaps, and single-token liquidity provisioning.\nBlueshift has always been at the forefront of technological developments in the DeFi space and Cardano/Milkomeda in particular. Blueshift's portfolio approach based on and combined with several innovative features, including single-sided token liquidity provision, internal pricing oracles, virtual pairs, and controllable minting schedules, has always been a key differentiator in the marketplace and driver of Blueshifts market dominance, especially on Milkomeda/Cardano. Blueshift users benefit from up to 10x lower impermanent loss, 2-10x lower price slippage, and a simplified user experience that will now be extended to cross-chain applications.\nBlueshift takes the world of decentralized exchanges to new heights with its remarkable cross-chain capabilities, made possible through the development of BluesChain using the Cosmos SDK. The Cosmos SDK, a highly regarded framework for building application-specific blockchains, empowers Blueshift to create a robust and versatile infrastructure that enables seamless interaction between multiple blockchain networks.\nBy harnessing the power of the Cosmos SDK and BluesChain, Blueshift can offer its users a streamlined and interconnected experience that transcends the limitations of traditional decentralized exchanges. Users can now effortlessly engage with various blockchain networks and take advantage of their unique features and opportunities, all within the Blueshift ecosystem. Users can perform cross-chain swaps in 10 seconds via possible routes on connected chains.\nAs the Blueshift ecosystem expands, our team will continue incorporating more chains. More chains will enhance the liquidity available from vetted projects being developed within these ecosystems, attracting a wider user base and further bolstering liquidity.\nBlueshift is integrated with the Milkomeda Cardano C1 sidechain, the Milkomeda Algorand A1 rollup, the Kava EVM, and Polygon.\nAs the progress of our partnership matures, our team will begin branching out to other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-based chains and ecosystems. This expansion will include chains like the BNB Chain, among others.\nIn addition to directly connecting with various chains, Blueshift fosters partnerships with pivotal ecosystem projects to curate ecosystem portfolios. These portfolios consist of top-tier project tokens from specific ecosystems.\nThese ecosystem portfolios offer users, even those with limited time or experience in various ecosystems, to gain exposure to vetted projects being developed on those respective chains.\nAn exemplification of this concept can be found in indices like the Cardano Index. This index comprises key projects built on the Cardano chain, specifically those aiming to extend their reach cross-chain and evolve into interoperable projects.\nThe Blueshift Cardano Index presents an exceptional opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the growth potential of the Cardano ecosystem. This innovative index is designed to expose participants to a diverse range of projects built on the Cardano blockchain, capturing the value of established and emerging tokens.\nBy constructing a carefully curated portfolio, the Blueshift Cardano Index allows participants to benefit from the combined performance of various Cardano-based projects without the need to research extensively or individually manage each asset. This approach simplifies the decision-making process and ensures participants maintain a balanced exposure to the dynamic and rapidly evolving Cardano ecosystem.\nMoreover, the Blueshift Cardano Index utilizes an adaptive rebalancing strategy to keep the portfolio optimized in response to market fluctuations and the evolving landscape of the Cardano network. Regularly adjusting the portfolio's composition, Blueshift ensures that participants remain well-positioned to capitalize on the most promising projects and trends within the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe Blueshift team has constructed an analytics dashboard that monitors the price of liquidity pool tokens as a collective group. The dashboard serves as a barometer to assess the ecosystem's overall performance.\nWith this tool, users can effortlessly acquire a comprehensive view of how an ecosystem is trending over time simply by tracking the traded price of the Cardano Index LP (Liquidity Pool) token. The Cardano Index provides users with a snapshot of the ecosystem's health and progression at any moment.\nCardano DeFi stands out with its unique features, ushering in fresh ideas and concepts. We are now witnessing the emergence of a secondary market for LP tokens, allowing them to be directly traded on various Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) within the Cardano ecosystem.\nThis development enables the Cardano Index LP token to be bridged to the Cardano ecosystem, where it can be traded, staked, or used in additional liquidity token pairs across various DEXes.\nUsers can easily gain exposure to the Cardano Index by simply swapping for the LP token directly on various DEXes.\nMoreover, with the launch of our cross-chain swaps, we now have the potential to connect other ecosystem indexes to Cardano. This connection allows users to trade and stake and provides opportunities for further liquidity provisioning against the LP token.\nBlueshift will develop and manage an Interoperability Index to facilitate interoperability among various chains.

    "prompt": "Cardano advances with Valentine upgrade and zippier P2P nodes?",
    "completion": "Cardano is gradually and securely becoming a blockchain capable of hosting a new decentralized financial system. The biggest upgrades of recent years implemented using hard forks have added stake delegation, native assets and NFTs, and the Plutus and Marlowe smart contract platforms.\nAt first sight, improvements so far this year are more subtle, but they affect all of the core areas interoperability, scalability, and sustainability that define Cardano as a third-generation blockchain. Furthermore, they help software developers who are using Plutus smart contracts.\nFirst off, February s upgrade, Valentine, helps developers to create software that uses smart contracts, and extends the compatibility of Cardano with other blockchains. The upgrade name came from the scheduled release date coinciding with Saint Valentine's day for the love of DApps!\nBefore the date was set and that name applied, the upgrade was called SECP. This stands for Standards for Efficient Cryptography protocol, named after the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group. This consortium began setting commercial standards for cryptography in 1998. The group bases its techniques on elliptic curves because breaking codes involving these curves is very difficult, yet the key codes are shorter than with other methods.\nThe Valentine upgrade adds support for a curve called SECP256k1. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin use this for their public key cryptography, so the change improves compatibility between Cardano and these other leading blockchains. In particular, people and firms creating decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano will be able to use two more types of signature, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr, to verify data. This is in addition to Cardano s native signature algorithm, the Edwards-curve Digital Signature algorithm (EdDSA).\nAdding these signatures to Cardano saves money and time for developers, and removes the potential for making errors that could reduce security when writing smart contracts in Plutus. Already, there are more than 7,800 Plutus scripts running on Cardano.\nThe aim of improving interoperability the ability of blockchains to work together is one of the three core concepts driving the creation of Cardano. Blockchain compatibility is vital to the acceptance of decentralized technology on a global scale, and Cardano is helping make this possible with cross-chain transfers, many types of tokens, and common smart contracts.\nThe Valentine signature changes mean that transactions generated on a sidechain such as the Ethereum-compatible EVM or another blockchain can be verified easily against Cardano.\nAnother core concept where there has been recent progress is scalability. Here, Hydra technology, which sits on top of Cardano as a layer 2 protocol, is important. Hydra gives developers the potential to create their own mini-blockchains heads for functions that can be handled off the main blockchain. Hydra heads speed up processing time for an application and also free up the main chain from doing that work. The technology also cuts transaction costs. Input Output Global (IOG) and MLabs are working on an auction using Hydra to demonstrate the power of the technology. Another project, this time with Obsidian Systems, is introducing payments using Hydra.\nThe third concept is sustainability. For a blockchain to carry on working in the long term, it has to be decentralized, so that no single party or small group is in control. Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication ensures that network connectivity remains decentralized by allowing relay nodes the thousands of computers kept running round-the-clock by Cardano s stake pool operators to interact directly with each other.\nPool operators are advised to run one node configured to produce blocks, and at least two relay nodes. Until recently, relay nodes had to be set up manually to link to other relay nodes.\nThe advance comes from the release of Cardano node software with more automated communication capabilities (versions 1.35.6 and 1.35.7). With Dynamic P2P, a pool operator does not have to manually configure links to other nodes; it is done automatically. This means that when parts of the network fail, slow down or are attacked by hackers, each node can find new peers itself across the internet. The operator does not have to intervene.\nThe update automates the way each node selects which other nodes to talk to when validating transactions or performing any of the many tasks needed to keep Cardano on the road. Dynamic P2P enhances security because it makes the network more resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. If a node goes down or the connection quality worsens, the network automatically adjusts to link to nodes that are running well.\nUltimately, the efficiency of the whole network improves because block diffusion time is minimized. Nodes running in the P2P mode make smarter choices about which other relay peers to maintain links to, based on quality measurements. These local choices by each node result in a network-wide continuous optimization that minimizes the time to send blocks and transactions across the network.\nWorking with other blockchains, writing smart contracts in Plutus, handling more tasks, and a more resilient Cardano network are all stages in developing a finance system that can be used by anyone, anywhere. Another piece of the decentralized financial (DeFi) jigsaw was added when Djed, a stablecoin on Cardano, went live at the end of January. Within a day, Djed attracted 27m ada in backing and was available on exchanges such as MinSwap, MuesliSwap, and Wingriders.\nSix ada back each Djed to help keep the coin s price stable. That backing will unlock DeFi opportunities for the Cardano ecosystem, as well as Djed being used for settling payments and covering fees.\nAlongside the technology advances, IOG has expanded its training courses. This should benefit both programmers and people working in finance who do not have programming experience. The IOG Academy provides courses, technical guides, and Q&A sessions covering Marlowe and Plutus, the smart contract platforms for Cardano. A starting point for this is a course on GitHub that gives the basics of the Haskell language for Marlowe and Plutus.\nOver the past five years, more than 500 people at IOG have been beavering away on Cardano. That figure is now being multiplied by the large number of developers outside the company. They have launched 119 projects so far, with a thousand more in the pipeline. With every upgrade to Cardano, IOG aims to make their life easier and the road to decentralized finance for the world easier.\nNothing in this article is intended to be professional advice, including without limitation, financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.

    "prompt": "IOG and MLabs cooperate to develop a reference implementation of an auction using Hydra protocols?",
    "completion": "Input Output Global and MLabs are collaborating on developing a reference implementation of an auction using Hydra protocols. The first outcome of this collaboration is a paper outlining possible approaches to the implementation of digital asset auctions using the Hydra Head protocol with respective advantages and current limitations. This post introduces a brief summary of the topics covered in more detail in the paper.\nThis collaboration aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the current implementation of the Hydra Head protocol to develop auction applications. The proposed reference implementation also constructively determines and aligns the Hydra Head protocol design with the concrete use cases in the Cardano ecosystem.\nDecentralized auctions use smart contracts to execute a deal between buyers and sellers.\nThe benefits of blockchain auctions include:\nThe Hydra Head protocol is a layer 2 scalability solution on Cardano. The protocol consists of smart contracts and software that allow any group of participants to establish isomorphic, multi-party state channels (Hydra heads) with each other.\nHydra head channels are beneficial for running auctions on Cardano because layer 2 solutions provide better capabilities in terms of:\nCardano can run different auction types using the Hydra Head protocol. Auction designs on a single head can cover basic single-head auctions, single-head secret auctions, delegated custodial auctions, voucher auctions, or delegated voucher auctions. Auction designs on networks of Hydra heads can cover such cases as star-shaped auctions or constellation schema auctions (read this paper for auction style explanations).\nFor the reference implementation of an auction using the Hydra Head protocol, the teams chose the delegated voucher auction design including core English-style auction features. For a detailed analysis of possible options with their benefits and limitations, see the paper.\nThe initial design of the auction aims to provide the following features:\nA group of delegates can open a Hydra head capable of hosting an auction for an NFT asset provided by a seller.\nThe seller can distribute the right to participate (eg, via participation tokens) in the auction to prospective bidders who have locked their deductible deposits in a smart contract for the auction.\nEach bidder can submit a bid to the auction by sending it to one of the delegates, who will then broadcast it to the rest of the delegates.\nDelegates can collectively acknowledge bids by multi-signing via the Hydra Head protocol, thus including the bids in the Hydra head ledger state.\nWhen the auction deadline elapses, the delegates can deterministically settle the bids within the Hydra head to determine the winning bid.\nDelegates can close the Hydra head:\nIf the auction is settled, a voucher can be issued to the winning bidder, which allows the winning bidder to redeem the seller s NFT asset in exchange for the bid amount.\nIf the auction is not settled, its bids can be settled on layer 1 to determine the winning bid, and then the voucher can be issued to the winning bidder.\nLosing bidders can redeem their deductible deposits when the auction s Hydra head closes and the auction is settled.\nThe winning bidder can use the funds in his deductible deposit in his payment to the seller for the NFT asset.\nWhen the voucher is issued to the winning bidder, a deadline is set to redeem the seller s NFT asset. If the winning bidder does not redeem the seller s NFT asset by the deadline, the seller can claim the winning bidder s deductible deposit.\nThe voucher UTXO can only be spent by the winning bidder to redeem the seller s NFT, or by the seller to claim the winning bidder s deductible deposit after the redemption deadline.\nIf you are interested to find out more, read this Implementing auction projects using Hydra paper.\nThe paper reflects on:\nThe current needs of projects running digital asset auctions (eg, NFT marketplaces) in the Cardano ecosystem and the challenges they face on the Cardano layer 1 chain.\nThe analysis of challenges and requirements suggests possible auction designs to use Hydra for running digital asset auctions and their respective implications for liveness, decentralization, security, and efficiency.\nThe proposed Hydra head auction design implementation based on current capabilities.\nSuggested improvements to the current Hydra Head protocol along with proposed extensions to the Hydra family of protocols to benefit running digital asset auctions.\nTo get involved join this Discord channel or take part in GitHub discussions.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Cardano Working Groups how to get involved?",
    "completion": "The Cardano ecosystem has seen tremendous growth in the past year. With this growth, there have been areas of development that have needed to expand in parallel. One way to tackle these usability and interoperability domains through community collaboration is the assembly of a number of informal developer Working Groups (WG). Read on to learn about what these are, and how you can get involved.\nA Working Group brings together experts and committed community members around one specific topic of discussion. Each group sets its own goals regarding solutions to drive ecosystem success and adoption going forward.\nInput Output Global (IOG) is currently facilitating the creation and bootstrapping of these groups. The ultimate goal is community empowerment to self-mobilize and collaborate on decision-making processes and solution implementation.\nWhile more WGs can be created based on need and the community s willingness to mobilize, IOG is currently encouraging community members to join the following groups:\nThis group seeks to identify DApp developers problems and pain points. Group participants will be able to help triage and prioritize the improvement areas and feature requests that will serve the ecosystem effectively. By collaborating with other players in the ecosystem, they will be able to participate in building solutions for Cardano s DApp development. Participation in this group also includes identifying key stakeholders, creating and contributing to Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), and (if required) assisting in the provision of funds and resources (ie. via Project Catalyst).\nThis group aims to promote the benefits of certification across Cardano and the wider industry. The group also seeks to encourage more DApps to go through the certification process and create best practices and standards in certification and auditing processes.\nThis WG was created to support the development of cross-chain decentralized bridges between Cardano and other chains. The more cross-chain solutions there are, the more diverse the user experience becomes as the community won t be siloed within a single ecosystem.\nStablecoins are essential in addressing cryptocurrency volatility one of the obstacles to blockchain s wider adoption. With several solutions already in the works, this group seeks to combine best practices and expertise to support the implementation of stablecoins on Cardano.\nInvitations to WGs are now open! Any community member can apply to become a member of their preferred group. Admission into the WG will depend on approval from its members, and the applicant s qualifications.\nIf you are interested in joining any of the above WGs and have the relevant expertise to do so, don t hesitate to apply today via this registration form.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Everything you always wanted to know about Impermanent Loss and were afraid to ask?",
    "completion": "Disclaimer: Nothing in this article is intended to be professional advice, including without limitation, financial, investment, legal or tax advice. Input Output Global is not responsible for your use of or reliance on any information in this article.\nOriginal author:\nFernando Sanchez - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: May 27th, 2022\nArticle:\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term that refers to decentralized applications (DApps), services, protocols, and financial instruments built on blockchain. It is a relatively new industry segment enabled by decentralized ledger technology, which means there is no single authority with centralized control over the system. And anyone familiar with the DeFi environment probably knows about impermanent loss. It's a simple concept with a misleading name.\nCardano is a third-generation blockchain whose expansive DeFi universe features, among many other DApps, decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These are crypto exchange protocols that enable peers to trade cryptocurrencies with each other. DEXs use two main design architectures: automated market maker (AMM) and order book. The implementation of AMMs is relatively simple, and this design has since become the de facto choice for Account-based chains, including Ethereum. However, this design has some inherent deficiencies. Their tendency to incur impermanent loss, for example.\nCardano uses an extended unspent transaction output (EUTxO) accounting model to track the movement of assets across the chain. EUTxO is deterministic, which offers better predictability of impermanent loss.\nThese seemingly unrelated concepts coalesce into a very interesting interplay on the blockchain. This article considers DEX designs and explains why EUTxO offers better predictability of impermanent loss than Account-based accounting models.\nWhen the total value of assets provided as liquidity is lower than the value that would have accrued had you simply held onto them.\nThis is the simplest definition of impermanent loss, a concept that inspires dread on liquidity providers.\nImpermanent loss occurs when the price of the assets deposited into a liquidity pool changes (upwards or downwards) in relation to when they were deposited. In other words, the worth of your assets when you withdraw them is different to when you deposited them into the liquidity pool.\nThe name impermanent is slightly misleading, as a decrease in token price might only be temporary, and the price might rise again following market or trading conditions, etc. In this case, the loss would be temporary (i.e., impermanent), because the price rectified upwards. The change becomes permanent only if the dollar price of the token at withdrawal is less than it was when the token was deposited.\nYou could argue that impermanent loss is the risk that liquidity providers take in exchange for fees earned by trading crypto pairs on liquidity pools. If the loss is greater than the fees earned, the liquidity provider realizes a loss, which might not have happened had they held onto their tokens instead. It is interesting to note that you might not actually lose money, but your gains might be less than if you had just held the tokens.\nUnderstanding impermanent loss requires a basic understanding of how DEXs work. Currently, DEXs use two design models: AMM and order book. Each comes with a set of advantages and disadvantages when it comes to impermanent loss, which are explored. below.\nAMM\nThe Automated Market Maker (AMM) DEX mode enables automated trading of cryptocurrency pairs using smart contracts. These pairs are usually (but not always) an Ethereum-based token and a stablecoin.\nAMMs rely on liquidity pools, which are mechanisms that facilitate users to pool their assets into smart contracts. The more liquidity there is in the pool, the easier it becomes to trade on the DEX the pool is associated with, and the higher the fees and rewards earned by liquidity providers. Liquidity pools aggregate the liquidity provided by investors into both sides of the trading pair. The pool uses an algorithm that looks at the current liquidity to calculate the pair's market price at that time. To put it another way, the algorithm considers the availability of a particular asset in the pool to determine its price.\nAMMs rely almost entirely on liquidity providers to provide liquidity to expand the pool's size and ensure the assets are traded at a fair price. This design trait effectively means that the liquidity providers are the market makers.\nLiquidity providers need an incentive to invest, of course. This comes in the form of yield farming, essentially token rewards earned through lending or staking of digital assets.\nOrder book\nThe mechanics behind the order book design have been around the economics field for a long time. It is a very straightforward model. The order book simply lists all the buy/sell (asks/bids, in this context) orders, so when the traders put in their orders, the order book sorts them according to the asset's price. If there is supply and demand, the asset can be traded.\nOrder books also require deep liquidity to function efficiently. Traditionally, this liquidity comes from market makers. These market makers provide limit orders on both the buy side and the sell side of the book, profiting from the spread (bid-ask or bid-offer spread) between buy and sell orders. Order book liquidity essentially comes from these buy and sell limit orders. This liquidity does not need to be from large institutional market makers. It could also come from individuals, who may even pool liquidity together, blurring the lines of a central order limit book and liquidity providers in an AMM.\nUTXO-based ledgers, like Cardano, are far more suitable for order book architecture, as this design, together with Cardano's EUTxO features, mitigates the effects of impermanent loss.\nLiquidity providers provide liquidity to pools for financial returns. But this brings with it risk. The amount of tokens in the pool and number of liquidity providers contributing to it are major factors on the possibility of impermanent loss occurring, and such consideration is important for potential liquidity providers. Frequent impermanent loss leads to pools drying up and liquidity providers looking elsewhere.\nHere's the insidious thing about impermanent loss: it is very difficult to predict whether or not it will occur, and to what degree.\nQuick intro:\nUTXO-based chains: there are no accounts holding a balance. Instead, users' wallets keep track of a list of unspent outputs associated with all addresses owned by the user, and calculate the users balance. UTXO is, in many ways, similar to cash transactions. Cardano s EUTxO model adds a datum, which is contract-specific data. This is important as it confers Cardano with the ability to support multi-assets and smart contracts.\nAccount-based model - This accounting model uses an account (which can be controlled by a private key or a smart contract) to hold a coin balance. In this model, assets are represented as balances within users accounts, and the balances are stored as a global state of accounts. The state is kept by each node and updated with every transaction.\nThere are several fundamental differences between these two models, but when it comes to AMMs and impermanent loss, there is one key distinction. AMMs operating on Account-based chains (like Ethereum) tend to use a Constant Formula Market Maker (CFMM) pricing formula, which is one of the more commonly used algorithms for AMMs. This formula contains inherent inefficiencies. For example, the Total Value Locked (TVL) -defined as the sum of all staked crypto assets earning rewards, interest, etc.- is distributed across the entire price range, which implies that the price of an asset is equally likely to be $1 or $10,000. Under this assumption, CFMM prices are unrealistic and tend not to reflect actual market conditions. Also, trades on low token volume tend to lead to high slippage (the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order actually executes.) While CFMM is a popular choice for AMMs, these inefficiencies might result in the dilution of revenues for liquidity providers. More importantly, this liquidity is subject to impermanent loss.\nEUTxO architecture's inherent advantages of security, determinism, parallelism, and scalability offer an ideal environment for DEXs using order book design, as it presents stronger resilience to impermanent loss. One key advantage of this design is concentrated liquidity (liquidity that is allocated within a custom price range.) This feature maximizes the liquidity's efficiency and minimizes impermanent loss.\nUnlike Account-based blockchains where every single transaction outcome alters the global state, in UTXO-based blockchains, the validity of a transaction is assessed at the transaction level, and the balance is the sum of remaining UTXOs. At the local state, in other words.\nThis immediately poses a problem for Account-based chains. A multitude of smart contracts and other actors continuously interact and influence the global state, which means that assets and resources are consumed, and gas prices rise and fall all the time. A side effect of this is that transaction fees can (and do) fluctuate. Effectively, this means that a transaction's gas fees might spike significantly in the interval between the transaction being submitted and validated. Consequently, such a transaction might not be accepted by the chain, but the gas fees are taken anyway, potentially leading to financial loss for the user. This is one of the Ethereum chain's main design flaws.\nFee wastage cannot occur in Cardano's EUTxO model, since transactions are processed and validated at the local state. This is achieved by adding a datum (additional data) to the transaction. The datum contains contract-specific information, which is passed to the transaction's validation logic, thus maintaining EUTxO's deterministic context. This effectively means that transaction fees are known in advance, and will not change. A welcome side effect of EUTxO and determinism is that transactions cannot be rearranged by bad actors, another risk of Account-based models.\nThe local nature of transaction validation offers yet another significant advantage: a high degree of parallelism. A node could validate transactions in parallel, as long as those transactions do not attempt to consume the same input. This cannot be done in Account-based chains, as transactions must be processed sequentially by design.\nFurther enhancements\nThe Plutus platform provides a native smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain.\nUpcoming Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) to Plutus include:\nCIP-31: Reference Inputs\nCIP-32: Inline Datums\nCIP-33: Reference Scripts\nCIP-40: Collateral Outputs\nImpermanent loss is the net difference between the value of two cryptocurrency assets in a liquidity pool-based AMM.\nThe impermanent loss is calculated by comparing the value of the tokens at withdrawal against the value of just holding them.\nStablecoins have price stability, so liquidity pools that utilize stablecoins can be less exposed to impermanent loss.\nUTXO-based chains using order book DEX design are more resilient to impermanent loss than AMM DEXs on Account-based chains\nFee wastage cannot occur in the EUTxO model, since transactions are processed and validated at the local state\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "The Role of Stablecoins in Cardanos DeFi Ecosystem?",
    "completion": "Stablecoins have become an essential element of cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value against another specific asset or basket of assets, such as the US dollar or a commodity like gold. This stability makes them an ideal tool for use in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As DeFi on Cardano continues to expand its capabilities, the importance of Cardano-native stablecoins is only likely to increase.\nDeFi refers to a new financial system built on top of open and decentralized blockchain networks that operate without centralized intermediaries such as banks, governments, or other financial institutions.\nIn DeFi, anyone can access financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and investing without having to go through traditional financial intermediaries.\nSince DeFi applications are built on decentralized blockchains, they operate on a trustless, open, and transparent system. User transactions are executed through blockchain-based smart contracts and recorded on the public blockchain, providing users with greater control and autonomy over their financial activities.\nThis emerging financial system has gained popularity due to its potential to disrupt traditional finance, increase financial inclusion, and create new opportunities for innovation and growth, especially in markets where users have greater difficulty accessing traditional financial services.\nIn this blog, we explain a bit more about Cardano s DeFi ecosystem, DEXs on Cardano, and their features to create passive income streams, as well as take a closer look at the role of stablecoins like USDA in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem.\nCardano is one of the largest decentralized blockchain networks with a huge global user community. From the beginning, it has been designed and built to be an open-source blockchain that delivers accessible economic services to all by providing a platform to host decentralized applications (dApps) for finance, identity, property, and more. Cardano is the first blockchain to be built according to scientific peer-review methods and is provably secure.\nCardano s DeFi ecosystem has significantly developed and now comprises a wide range of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEX), crypto wallets, and more.\nOne of the most popular DeFi protocols on Cardano is the Cardano Native Token (CNT) standard, which allows users to create and manage custom tokens on the Cardano blockchain. Other notable protocols include the Marlowe smart contract language, which enables users to create complex financial contracts, and the Plutus programming language, which allows developers to build decentralized applications on the Cardano blockchain.\nRecent data indicates that the Cardano DeFi ecosystem has increased by an estimated 170 since March 2021. As of early 2023, there were approximately 4 million active wallets as opposed to 500,00 active wallets in March 2021. Data has shown that the value being stored by users on Cardano DeFi applications, commonly referred to as Total Value Locked (TVL), has been at all-time highs in 2023.\nOverall, the Cardano DeFi ecosystem is quickly becoming a major player in the DeFi space, and its growth shows no signs of slowing down.\nDEXs on Cardano are also an important part of Cardano DeFi because they provide ADA users with a secure and trustless trading environment that is uniquely peer-to-peer.\nUnlike centralized exchanges, where users need to trust the exchange with their funds, DEXs allow users to retain full control of their assets at all times. This is achieved through the use of blockchain smart contracts, which automate the process of trading and ensure that transactions are executed securely and transparently.\nA DEX, short for decentralized exchange, aims to provide an on-chain infrastructure that is accessible without permission and third-party intermediaries. They also strive for decentralized ownership of application protocols, distributed across a community of stakeholders. To achieve this, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) usually governs the administrative rights of the protocol. The DAO is made up of a community of stakeholders who vote on critical protocol decisions.\nAs explained above, a DEX offers a permissionless option for traders who would like to trade in cryptocurrencies. A well-structured DEX often has the following features:\nAMM: Automated Market Makers (AMM) are protocols used in liquidity pools that help in automatically pricing assets. This enables crypto trading without the need for traditional market makers or order books. Instead, it relies on a mathematical formula to determine the price of an asset based on the supply and demand of that asset within the DEX.\nYield Farming: Yield farming is conducted using AMMs. Yield farming is a DeFi practice where investors earn a return on their cryptocurrency by lending or staking it in a liquidity pool. It involves providing crypto liquidity to DEXs or DeFi protocols in exchange for rewards. Yield farming can generate high yields but also involves higher risks due to cryptocurrency volatility and smart contract vulnerabilities.\nLiquidity Pools: Liquidity pools are an essential part of every DeFi ecosystem. In simple terms, to form a market, users known as liquidity providers (LPs) combine two tokens of equal value into a pool. They receive trading fees from the trades that take place in their pool in proportion to their share of the total liquidity in return for contributing their cash.\nLiquidity Mining: Liquidity mining also known as Yield mining is when you earn rewards for allowing a decentralized trading service to use your tokens for a locked period. Yield farming, on the other hand, is the process of earning rewards by lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity to a DeFi platform.\nThanks to its large community and technical scalability and interoperability features, Cardano has quickly become a popular option for building DeFi applications.\nHere are some of the top DEXs built on the Cardano platform. These DEXs offer features such as AMMs, Liquidity Pools, Yield Farming, and Liquidity Mining options to users helping them create a steady passive income stream.\nMinswap: At the time of writing, Minswap had a TVL of $55 million. Minswap currently ranks as the #1 DEX on Cardano. It offers AMM and liquidity pools through which users can provide liquidity to Minswap s liquidity pools by depositing two different cryptocurrencies, and in exchange, they receive a liquidity token representing their share of the pool.\nSundaeSwap: TVL of $7.5 million. SundaeSwap is an AMM that incentivizes users to provide liquidity to its liquidity pools through yield farming and liquidity mining programs. Users can stake their liquidity tokens to earn rewards in the form of the platform s native token.\nMuesliSwap: TVL of $9 million. MuesliSwap was the very first decentralized exchange to be built on the Cardano protocol and has reached one of the top positions as one of the most used Cardano DeFi dApps. It offers features such as order-book trading, liquidity pools, DEX aggregator, and staking. MuseliSwap offers liquidity pools as part of its Hybrid DEX. According to a recent report, the Cardano algorithmic stablecoin Djed, will list on MuesliSwap and Minswap offering better liquidity mining options.\nIndigo: TVL of $29 million. Indigo is a decentralized non-custodial synthetic assets protocol built for Cardano. It s worthwhile to note that it is possible to use Indigo s Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) Liquid Staking which enables a wallet to collect ADA staking benefits while the delegated ADA is also being used elsewhere only on Cardano.\nWingRiders: TVL of $16 million. WingRiders is a native and fast AMM decentralized exchange platform on Cardano that offers token swaps between Cardano and ERC20 tokens, staking of ADA within liquidity pools, yield farming, community governance, and more.\nQuick note: Other DeFi dApps such as Genius Yield, Axo Trade, TeddySwap, and Astarter will also be launching soon and will be available on Yoroi Swap with a Yoroi DEX aggregator coming in the future.\nStablecoins play a key role in expanding the reach of DeFi and improving interoperability between DeFi and traditional markets. Stablecoins allow businesses and consumers to explore and participate in DeFi while keeping their funds dollar-denominated and not investing in a particular cryptocurrency. They also allow merchants to accept decentralized currency without tying their fate to a particular token or dealing with overly complex treasury management. Stablecoins provide important on-ramps for new DeFi users both businesses and individuals by allowing them to join decentralized protocols without making an investment or fretting over whether it is an opportune time to enter the market. And finally, stablecoins can also be used as a trading pair for other cryptocurrencies, enabling traders to move in and out of positions quickly without having to convert to fiat currency.\nEMURGO announced the launch of USDA, a fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin in the Cardano ecosystem. USDA is the first product from EMURGO Fintech s Anzens product suite and will allow users to tokenize their USD into USDA through credit & debit cards, wire transfers, and also conversions into ADA.\nUSDA aims at offering Cardano users better security, stable gas fees, and faster global transactions.

    "prompt": "CIP1694 Community Workshops?",
    "completion": "- Tokyo, Japan June, 2023\n- Edinburgh, Scotland July, 2023\nCIP-1694 marks the first iteration of Cardano s on-chain governance. Given its importance, achieving broad consensus is vital as Cardano looks to the future. To make that happen, it s equally important the community conducts its own governance discussions and events.\nThe recent Cardano governance workshop in Colorado in early March, and a recap online event on 30th of March, are good examples of this collaboration. Led by key contributors and thought leaders in the community, both workshops sparked deep engagement and insight gathering, capturing inputs from a broad spectrum of community interests and experiences. Participants engaged in a range of collaborative activities and discussions to refine and debate the on-chain governance system proposed in CIP-1694. The workshops were productive, established a model for future community events, and highlighted the importance of collaboration and inclusivity in governance frameworks.\nThe conversations on CIP-1694 thus far are only the start. Today, a grant program is opening up to support community workshops across May, June, and July 2023. The global community events will be punctuated by two workshops held in Tokyo, Japan, and Edinburgh, Scotland during June and July co-hosted by EMURGO and IOG. Edinburgh's event in July will wrap up the year's workshops and bookend the feedback loop on CIP-1694 design. Dates for each co-hosted event will be announced in early May.\nThere's an open invitation for global community leaders and groups to run their own workshops, with financial support made available. This is your chance to bring Cardano and discussions on governance to your local community. The community-led events should welcome everyone wanting to participate and contribute to Cardano s governance. If you are interested in running a workshop on CIP-1694, we re seeking applications that cover some or all of the following:\nEvents can be held both virtually and in-person, with varying degrees of support available depending on location and expected participation\nEvents must be accessible and inclusive. In-person events are expected to cater to the local geography/community\nApplicants should be able to demonstrate capability, capacity, and previous experience to:\nBuild a local event team\nSourcing a suitable venue\nOrganize local vendors for food & drinks\nCommunicating and socializing the event (there will be additional support)\nIdeally, applicants should already have a good technical grasp of CIP-1694 to facilitate their event effectively\nIt s advantageous if applicants have relevant experience running a Cardano community group and/or have hosted previous events\nAll community-led hosts will be supported with:\n$500 per virtual event and up to $5,000 per in-person event\nFinancial support is intended to cover a mix of:\nEvent setup/venues and any infrastructure required\nRefreshments and food depending on event\nAdministration to facilitate such as rewards or bounties to moderators and hosts\nMerchandise and swag for attendees/hosts\nAwareness and socializing campaign\nWorkshop materials, including Miro templates, briefing documents, suggested agenda, and more\nEach workshop will produce a summary of outputs in the agreed format that will be collated into larger themes and topics that may warrant further discussion or consideration. Each host will be expected to run a post-workshop survey.\nAdditionally, each host will have the opportunity to nominate a representative to deliver their workshops output at the final event in Edinburgh (a fixed travel stipend will support travel costs).\nApplication form: community leaders and groups to apply for their event/s by May 1st 2023 to be considered\nEvent review and location: we will review all applications and select the locations and virtual events that cover the broadest spectrum of the Cardano ecosystem.\nFinal confirmation: all applicants and the wider community will receive communication by May 5 about which events are confirmed and how they can participate.\nDebriefing call: during the week commencing May 8, we will host two debriefing calls (across two time zones) for confirmed hosts and their respective team/s. There will also be further support available during office hours.\nThose wanting to host a community-led event can apply here. Applications are open from Tuesday April 18 and close on Monday May 1, 2023 at 23:00 UTC.\nCan I run more than one event?\nYes, this is possible, and you can indicate your plans on the application form. That being said, to maintain a broad representation of community groups, or if there are duplications (for example the same location for two or more events), we may request revisions to your application. We will not reject applications for being ambitious or wanting to reach wider audiences, but please bear in mind we may ask you to reconsider parts of your plan if there are multiple applications for the same location, etc.\nHow long should the event be?\nIf your proposed workshop is in-person, we expect it to be a full day. If virtual, 2-3 hours is recommended but this remains flexible. The key thing here is to capture valuable community input as effectively (and enjoyably!) as possible.\nHow will financial support be provided?\nFinancial support is available and will cover both virtual and in-person workshops. For every virtual workshop that is successful in its application, a payment of $500 will be awarded. For in-person workshops, this increases to $5,000 and will require evidence of venue hire and other associated costs. $5,000 is a cap, not a target, and a cost breakdown will be required as part of your application.\nPayments will be made post-event (for both virtual and in-person meets), however in some circumstances we may provide financial support earlier (for example to secure venues etc). Your workshop outputs will be required as part of the criteria for your grant.\nWill IOG, the Cardano Foundation, and/or EMURGO representatives join workshops?\nYes! But given the anticipated breadth of events, it will depend on location, date, and time. As a result, attendance by IOG, the Cardano Foundation, or EMURGO cannot be guaranteed. If your application is successful, and there is an opportunity for representatives to participate, they will confirm with hosts directly.\nWhen will the last event be held?\nThe wrap-up event will be in Edinburgh in mid-July. Any community workshops must have been completed and shared their outputs at least 5 days prior.\n2023 6\n- 2023 7\nCIP-1694 Cardano Cardano\n3 Cardano 3 30 CIP-1694\nCIP-1694 2023 5 6 7 6 7 EMURGO IOG 2 7 CIP-1694 5\nCardano Cardano CIP-1694\n/\nCIP-1694\nCardano\n1 500 1 5,000\n/\n/\nMiro\n1. _ _ 2023 5 1\n2. _ _ Cardano\n3. _ _ 5 5\n4. _ 5 8 _ 2 2\n4 18 2023 5 2 ( ) 8:00\n1 2 3\n500 5,000 5,000\nIOG Cardano EMURGO\nIOG Cardano EMURGO\n7 5\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Cardano native tokens a simple explanation?",
    "completion": "Cardano native tokens allow anyone to create and transact digital assets with ease, directly on the blockchain, leading to a growing ecosystem of unique projects. But how do Cardano's native assets differ from ones on other blockchains, and how can you mint your own?\nRead on to learn about:\nwhat Cardano native tokens are,\ntheir benefits and use cases,\nhow they differ from other tokens,\nand how they're made.\nLet s dive in!\nIntroduced through the Mary protocol upgrade on February 24, 2021, Cardano native tokens were a significant innovation within the blockchain industry. While other blockchains require the use of smart contracts to mint tokens, Cardano supports creating and transacting tokens natively on the ledger.\nWhereas Bitcoin was only designed to be a digital currency, and Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts allowing developers to build their own decentralized applications (DApps), Cardano took it one step further by removing the need for custom code in creating DApps. This eliminates an entire layer of complexity present in other chains, as well as costs and the risk of human error.\nA public distributed ledger like Cardano is intended to track only one type of digital asset (ada). However, as the ledger evolves and becomes more decentralized, there comes a need and possibility to track multiple types of assets using the same infrastructure. This is the reason why some blockchains now support various digital assets, including:\nstablecoins\nutility tokens\ncredential tokens\nsecurity tokens, etc\nTo allow for transaction processing with different types of assets concurrently, the native token functionality extends the accounting infrastructure that is initially defined in the ledger model.\nIt is important to note that native tokens and Cardano s currency, ada, differ in two ways:\nNative tokens can be created and destroyed, while ada can t.\nOnly ada can be used to pay transaction fees and distribute staking rewards.\nCardano native tokens differ from other tokens in several ways, as illustrated in the table below.\nCreating a native token on Cardano is a straightforward process if you follow these steps:\nFigure 1. The prototype token builder dashboard\nOnce a native token is created, it can be sent and received like ada.\nThe Cardano Transaction Metadata (CMT) feature enables issuers to add information to their native tokens by including metadata within a transaction that specifies the:\nName\nSymbol\nIcon\nAmount of tokens\nCardano wallet address\nAnd monetary policy\nNative tokens have a range of use cases, including:\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): Used to create decentralized financial instruments such as stablecoins, which can be used as a store of value or a means of payment.\nGaming: Used to create in-game items tradable on decentralized marketplaces.\nCollectibles: Used to create, store, and transact unique digital art efficiently.\nIdentity token: Used to create decentralized identities, which enable secure authentication and verification of their issuers, and handle user permissions for different actions.\nSmart contract assurance: Used as an important tool in the building of reliable smart contracts.\nNative tokens are important for several reasons:\nThey represent a significant advancement in the Cardano ecosystem, as they provide a fast, efficient, and customizable way to create and transact both fungible and non-fungible assets.\nNative tokens can be used for a wide range of innovative purposes.\nThey provide a powerful, flexible, and decentralized approach to democratizing access to digital assets and promoting financial inclusion.\nLearn more about native tokens and their significance by reading this Cardano Docs section.\nDISCLAIMER: Nothing in this article is intended to be professional advice, including without limitation, financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.

    "prompt": "Why does Cardano stake not lock ADA?",
    "completion": "One of the basic questions about Cardano that every new user asks is Does Cardano stake pool lock ADA?\nThe answer is, No! Absolutely not\nThe ADA staking mechanism on Cardano's network does not lock assets at all. Users have full rights to use the assets in their wallets whenever and wherever they want.\nThis is very contrary to real-life common sense when we go to deposit in Bank or staking or farming services in Defi where users have to deposit their assets in\nIn this article, we will explore this special mechanism of Cardano.\nNote: To better understand new users need to have basic knowledge of Cardano address . Readers can refer to the documents of Cardano or the author will briefly summarize below.\nBlockchain technology is built on decentralization and the communication intermediary between the blockchain and the user is the address. The design of the address of a foundation blockchain is very important and it also greatly determines the development ability of that blockchain in the future.\nSince Cardano entered the Shelley era with the introduction of the Staking pool system, Cardano's address structure also changed from Byron address to Shelley address.\nThe Shelley address is the type of address that current users use to stake ADA into the Cardano network. Shelley addresses are divided into 2 types: payment addresses and stake addresses\nThe structure of a payment address consists of 2 parts combined together:\n- Payment part: containing information about the payment (payment credential)\n- Delegation part: containing information about the delegation (Stake Address Reference).\nIn the design of the Shelley address, the payment address will be used to receive and send assets. The stake address is only used to record relevant information about the ADA delegated to the Cardano network of the asset owner.\nBoth delegation and payment parts are cryptographically hashed from the private key which means they both contain the same original owner information.\nIf we analyze a common payment address via Explorer Cardanoscan.io we will see the following.\nAs above we have grasped the basic knowledge about Shelley address such as payment address, stake address, payment credential, stake credential, stake address reference\nThe following will explore the correlation between those components to see why ADA stakes don't lock up assets.\nAccording to the figure above, we can see the correlation inside a Shelley address structure.\n- Stake address reference will contain information about the number of assets in the payment address and record this information in the \"By value\" section\n- Value will be the reference to a record in stake credential\n- When a wallet delegates to a stake pool, the pool will record information about the asset from the stake address.\n- The Cardano network-wide staking system will only reference the information in the stake address of each generated address.\n- The information will be updated through each snapshot.\nSo we can see that ADA is always contained in the payment address, the system will only reference the information from that address. Therefore, the user is free to use ADA in his wallet anytime, anywhere.\nTo do this, the main point is that the payment address and stake address are encrypted from the public and private keys.\nThe diagram below will better explain the technical aspects of the design of the ADA staking mechanism.\nFig3. Correlation between address and stake pool\n- To stake ADA, every user must register to stake into a specific stake pool.\n- When a wallet registers into a pool, all components in this pool will only be able to register for the staking verifying key.\n- In simple terms, we can consider the Staking key as a stake address, and as we all know the stake address does not have the function of receiving and sending Cardano's assets. It only contains information about the property owner, not the right to change the property.\n- Finally, we all see that the stake pool or the Cardano system has absolutely no right to affect the ADA located in the user's wallet directly.\nThus, we can see the uniformity and science in the design of Shelley's address, and the staking system and the important thing is that ADA stakes do not lock assets.\nIn fact, the Cardano address is much more complex than what is shown above, it represents a visionary design for a huge ecosystem in the future.\nHopefully, every Cardano user can understand the value and safety of staking ADA on the Cardano blockchain network.\nThis article was written and checked by Vcoincheck.io team.

    "prompt": "SingularityDAO Standard for a Dapp project decentralized governance ?",
    "completion": "We all know that the DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization and a collection of decentralized agreements recorded on the blockchain through smart contracts. DAOs have been around since 2016 and currently, most of the protocol projects running on the blockchain are DAOs.\na Defi Dapp is a simple DAO, people participate in decentralized financial transactions through automated smart contracts with programmed rules. However, the biggest part of DAO is in the protocol administration part, it includes community governance, protocol management... And this is a very difficult part to build because the decentralized environment is complicated, along with the user's incomplete understanding. But it is undeniable that decentralized governance will be the trend of the future.\nTo improve the community's understanding, the best method is learning and studying DAO governance models of ongoing projects in the blockchain world. This series of articles will introduce readers to the best model management construction and implementation projects, the most standard implementation.\nSingularityDAO (SDAO) is a project built and developed by the SingularityNet foundation, this is a project of the type \"Defi asset management\" that launched on the Ethereum network in mid-2021 and is gradually moving to Cardano with projects under the Singularity ecosystem.\nSDAO's strength is in inheriting core AI technologies that are their strengths and the project leaders are key figures of SingularityNet such as Ben Goetzen, Marcello Mari, Mario Alberto Casiraghi... SDAO promises to be an attractive Defi asset management project to the community.\nHowever, the part that the author appreciates about SDAO is the governance of the protocol part stated by the SDAO team in their whitepaper. And let's take a look at SDAO's decentralized governance model as below.\nParticipants involved in the governance of the SDAO protocol include:\n1 . SDAO token holders\n2 . Participants are delegated by SDAO token holders\n3. SDAO team (beginning phases of the project)\nweight of vote = (owned tokens - tokens delegated to others) + delegated tokens\nSDAO token is the token that has the function of granting the right to participate in DAO governance voting events on the SingularityDAO protocol. The specific functions of the SDAO token are:\n1 . Vote on a SingularityDAO Governance Proposal through its Voting Function.\na. FOR : Agree\nb. AGAINST: Totally Disagree\nc. BLANCO: Disagree, but have comments to change the management strategy.\n2 . To create a SingularityDAO Governance Proposal.\n3 . To delegate voting function to another wallet on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe SDAO team holds very special positions and powers in SDAO governance, but they also state very clearly about the holding period as well as the conditions for them to give up their rights. This is a point that is very different from most other protocols as the original implementation team of the protocol usually does not state this.\nProposal creation right: is permission to create proposals for SDAO administrative activities. The SDAO team will only perform this task during phases 1 and 2 of the project and will hand it over to the community starting from phase 2.\nVeto right: is the right to veto any governance proposal made by the community. This is a very special right and it is only available to the SDAO team during the protocol-building phases. This right will not take effect after phase 5 of the project or any time before phase 5 when SDAO deems the SDAO decentralized governance platform to be completely sustainable. But it will not be de-active in phase 1.\nGuardian of Singularity: Is a very important position in the governance of SDAO. \"The Guardians\" have the right to suspend the operation of the SDAO protocol if they feel that the protocol is facing risks such as external attacks, and internal errors of the protocol. This position will belong to the SDAO team in the first 5 phases of the project and will be transferred to the community after phase 5. The most voted wallet will be the holder of the position of \"guardian of Singularity\".\nThis event is intended to find people (personal wallets) to participate in the implementation of the task of creating proposals for protocol governance. The community will calculate and set thresholds of \"n\" votes that must be met as a milestone for the event to be passed or not.\nThe \"n\" or minimum threshold will also represent the decentralization grade of SDAO over time. According to the published roadmap from the SDAO team, this event will take place regularly every quarter.\nThe special feature of this event is that it is immuned with the \"veto right\" of the SDAO team, which means that the event will have to have a result and SDAO has no power to interfere or have any special effects like abandoned events like other voting events.\nThe constitutional voting event is a public event that is activated from phase 2 of the project. Constitutional voting events pertain to critical SingularityDAO operational components, such as:\n1. The SDAO ERC-20 token.\n2. Voting Function.\n3. Voting Right.\n4. The Right to Create Proposals.\n5. The Right of Representation.\n6. Blockchain infrastructure.\nConstitutional voting events will require a higher voter turnout criteria than other events and a majority vote of at least 51 and an SDAO veto if it exists in at that time.\nAre events created to change, or adjust the operation of the SDAO protocol.\nThe functional voting event includes two types of events:\na. Major: pertain to adding functionality to the SingularityDAO Protocol. Functional Voting Events will require a medium turnout criteria and a 51 majority vote\nb. Minor: pertain to updating variables within existing features of the SingularityDAO Protocol These events will require a lower turnout criteria than Major Functional Voting Events, and need a 51 majority vote.\nThis is a very important event for SDAO, it marks that the SDAO team no longer has any special powers or rights with the SDAO protocol including the position of \"Guardian of Singularity\". That means that the governance of SDAO has been considered decentralized and democratic.\nThe Veto deactivation voting event will be passed through the supreme veto constitutional voting event and the SDAO team veto right is not applied in this event. The conditions for this event to take place are described as follows:\na. During a Supreme Veto Constitutional Voting Event it has been decided to dismantle the SingularityDAO Veto Right, which can occur 12 months after the start of Phase 5.\nb. Anytime before phase 5 if the SDAO team deems the decentralized governance network mature enough to prematurely dismantle its function. Will be activated by the SDAO team themself.\nc. This event will need high voter turnout compared to other voting events, 75 majority vote.\nThe process of decentralizing the governance of SDAO is shown in the following figure:\n1 . Phase 1 (first 12 months from launch)\n- The right to create proposals will belong to SDAO team.\n- SDAO team encourages the community to participate in the discussion and submit suggestions.\n- Create the first voting events to select authorized individuals (wallets) and introduce \"proposal creation\" to them.\n2 . Phase 2 (12 months after the end of phase 1)\n- Preparing and announce the \"n\" voting threshold for delagated people (wallets). - Introduce how to implement \"proposal creation right\" for delegated people (wallets) who reach threshold \"n\". At the end of the first month of Phase Two of the Creation of Proposals, a voting event will occur to lower the threshold by a certain amount, or to keep it as is. If the vote is to keep it as is, the same voting event will happen in the month thereafter, attempting once more to lower the threshold.\n- If this vote is accepted, the threshold to be able to create a proposal will be lowered from then on. The following month, another voting event will be held to lower the threshold by a certain amount, to keep it as is, or to increase the threshold by the same amount.\n- The threshold can be lowered up to a specified minimum threshold.\n- Once the minimum threshold is reached, phase 3 will be activated.\n3 . Phase 3 (12 months after the end of phase 2)\n- The right to create proposals is encouraged and exercised by an individual or authorized person (wallet).\n- During this time, this threshold cannot be lowered further but can be adjusted up if the community deems this necessary. In the case that the \"threshold\" is higher than this minimum at the end of phase 3, phase 2 will restart to lower the threshold again from the level that ended in phase 3 to the level needed in the phase 3, then phase 3 will restart.\n- If the threshold is reached at the end of Phase 3, then Phase 4 will begin.\n4. Phase 4 (12 months after the end of phase 3)\n- The minimum threshold will be lowered again for Create Proposal right\n5. Phase 5 (12 months after the end of phase 4)\n- The minimum threshold will be lowered again for Create Proposal right. This can only be changed with the SingularityDAO constitutional voting event.\nSummary clip\nSo we have learned the basics of how to build and develop the decentralized governance platform of SDAO. The last thing that we need to keep in mind is that all SDAO governance activities will be excuted through smart contracts, voting results will be sent to the blockchain, the actors involved in the management value will be represented by blockchain wallet addresses.\nPlease continue to learn about the next project MakerDAO here.\nSources: SingularityDAO website\nThis articles was written and checked by Vcoicheck.io team.

    "prompt": "Insecurity of secret key reusage?",
    "completion": "In the pre-blockchain era, the typical advice from cryptographers was Don't roll your own crypto! . This advice aimed to avoid security pitfalls, which are less likely to exist in rigorously researched inventions. However, the advice was muffled by the accelerated advancement of the blockchain space, where new cryptography was invented and rolled out every now and then. This article re-emphasizes the need for rigorous security analysis of every new cryptographic primitive, by demonstrating how a natural shortcut can lead to catastrophic consequences.\nCryptographers are frequently asked whether a single secret key can be used for different algorithms. This may seem like a convenient shortcut, but it is actually bad practice. It is important to use the secret key only for its intended purpose, even if these are repeatedly modeled as random 32 bytes. When asked this question, the typical answer is no . However, the reasons given for this answer are often too abstract for engineers. The typical explanation is that security analysis is only done in a standalone setting, which means there are no guarantees of security if the key is used in a way that deviates from its intended purpose.\nCardano uses ed25519 signatures and verifiable random functions (VRFs) to ensure security in cryptographic algorithms. Given their similarly structured public keys, one may be tempted to use the same secret key for both cryptographic primitives. However, doing so can allow an adversary to easily extract the secret key. Note that cryptographic systems used on Cardano are proven secure see ed25519 and ECVRF however, only in standalone settings (ie, ed25519 is proven secure in the setting where an adversary has access to signatures only).\nNOTE: Using the same secret keys for two distinct cryptosystems doesn't necessarily disclose the secret. However, it's a good example of why it's important to be cautious when using the same key for multiple algorithms. If you're unsure that using the same key for two algorithms is secure, it's better to assume that it isn't.\nSchnorr signatures are the basis of Ed25519 and ECVRF designs. Schnorr signatures have been around for some years, and are deployed widely in many applications. Following Cardano s Valentine upgrade, IOG introduced native support for Schnorr signatures over SECP256k1 curve in Plutus. Schnorr signatures are simply sigma protocols that are tied to a message. In particular, let (sk, vk) be a key pair such that vk = sk G with G being the elliptic curve base point (see annotation 1) that is the generator of a prime order group with prime order p. Then, the signature algorithm is defined interactively (between the prover [P] and the verifier [V]) as follows:\nNote that we have just described an interactive protocol where no messages are involved. We now briefly describe how to transform it into a non-interactive version that signs messages. A typical cryptographic method used for this purpose is the Fiat-Shamir transformation, which replaces the random challenges with outputs of a random oracle. The input to the random oracle is the transcript generated so far. Moreover, to link a signature (as described above) to a message, the message should be included while computing the hash that defines the challenge.\nThis post describes all algorithms in their interactive version; note that the Fiat-Shamir heuristic can be used to make any algorithm non-interactive. For simplicity, this post omits the specification of messages from the descriptions of Schnorr-like signature schemes.\nSubtle deviations from the protocol can be catastrophic. One such example is producing two signatures that share the same value R but a different value s. This completely breaks the system (for example, by using an incorrect source of randomness that returns the same value of k). With some basic algebraic knowledge at the high school level, it becomes apparent why. Assume there are two valid signatures (R, s) and (R, s') with s s'. Recall that the values c and c' are known to the verifier, and the latter knows that s = k + c * sk. Given that the value of R (and therefore k) is equal in both proofs, the verifier can compute the secret key as:\nFortunately, if the value k is chosen uniformly at random, the above happens with probability 1 / 2 256 which is negligible over the security parameter.\nThe ed25519 signature scheme, proposed by Bernstein, Duif, Lange, Schwabe, and Yang, is a variant of the Schnorr signature scheme designed specifically for curve Edwards25519. The main reason for this is to improve efficiency and security. Although we won't go into the specifics of the curve or its benefits, it is important to note that ed25519 introduces a key difference from Schnorr: its signatures are deterministic. This means that the randomness used in the first step of the prover is generated using a hash function, rather than sampling the value k uniformly at random. The rationale behind this decision is to address the past security flaw of the secret keys for ECDSA, which resulted from a lack of secure sources of randomness. By computing this value pseudorandomly, developers can rely on the security of the pseudorandom function instead of a potentially unreliable secure source of randomness.\nBelow we present a simplified version of ed25519, which differs from the standard version but not in any meaningful way for the attack described. Let KDF be a key derivation function (see annotation 2) that takes as input a key and an index, and returns an integer modulo p. Let (sk, vk) be a key pair such that vk = KDF (sk, 0) G. The protocol proceeds as follows:\nAs one can observe, both Schnorr and ed25519 algorithms are closely related. It's worth noting that in the secret key generation, the elliptic curve base point is not multiplied by the secret key. Instead, the secret key is utilized to derive two scalars. As mentioned earlier, the Fiat-Shamir heuristic can be utilized to make this algorithm non-interactive.\nThe ECVRF protocol is another protocol inspired by Schnorr in general and ed25519 in particular, specifically the ECVRF-EDWARDS25519-SHA512-ELL2 scheme in the VRF IRTF draft. With a VRF, a prover can create a pseudorandom value associated with their private key and prove that they did so correctly. While the specifics of why this is useful or how it is used are not relevant here, it is worth examining how the protocol functions.\nIn this algorithm, we use a different hash function, Hs2c , which takes an array of bytes as input and returns a point in the elliptic curve. Again, we simplify the protocol for this blogpost's core goal (extracting the keys of both VRF and Ed25519). Let (sk, vk) be a key pair such that vk = KDF (sk, 0) G. The protocol proceeds as follows:\nIt's clear that when using the same secret key, both ed25519 and ECVRF algorithms produce the same public key. This might appear to be a convenient way to reduce the burden on users who need to remember multiple keys or to set up complex key derivation mechanisms. However, unfortunately, using the same secret key can have catastrophic consequences.\nUsing the same secret key for both ed25519 and ECVRF can enable an adversary to effectively reveal the signer's secret key. As previously mentioned, the adversary's strategy involves tricking the ed25519 signer into producing the same value of k (and therefore R) as the VRF counterpart while having different values of the challenge c. If successful, the secret key can be extracted, and this attack is not difficult to carry out.\nTo execute this attack, an adversary only needs a VRF proof for public key pk and must request an ed25519 signature from pk's owner to sign L, which is a public value. The nonces k will be identical in both instances, but the challenges will be different, enabling the adversary to recover the key.\nThe script below demonstrates the simplicity of the attack. The script takes a VRF proof for any message as input and then requests the owner of the key to sign a specific message using ed25519. This results in the extraction of the secret key. One can also see that the forged signature is accepted by the ed25519 verifier in libsodium.\nWe start by defining the message we will use for the VRF proof and initializing some variables:\n#define MESSAGE (const unsigned char *) \"yup\" #define MESSAGE_LEN 3 // The message that we need to craft in order to extract the key is a value // publicly available. However, libsodium does not export the functions to // compute it. Nonetheless, it is computed internally. To simplify our lives, // we slightly modify libsodium VRF verifier to return the crafted message. unsigned char crafted_msg[32], proof[80], sig[crypto_sign_BYTES], pk[crypto_sign_PUBLICKEYBYTES];\n#define MESSAGE (const unsigned char *) \"yup\" #define MESSAGE_LEN 3 // The message that we need to craft in order to extract the key is a value // publicly available. However, libsodium does not export the functions to // compute it. Nonetheless, it is computed internally. To simplify our lives, // we slightly modify libsodium VRF verifier to return the crafted message. unsigned char crafted_msg[32], proof[80], sig[crypto_sign_BYTES], pk[crypto_sign_PUBLICKEYBYTES];\nNext, we create a scope for the signer, which we cannot access when faking the signature:\n{ unsigned char sk[crypto_sign_SECRETKEYBYTES]; crypto_sign_keypair(pk, sk); // Now let's use these keys for vrf generation. crypto_vrf_ietfdraft03_prove(proof, sk, MESSAGE, MESSAGE_LEN); // Now, we have a proof that consists of 80 bytes that correspond to: // * 32 bytes of an EC point that we can ignore // * 16 bytes of a challenge C = H(pk, H, Gamma, U, V), where the values // of H, Gamma, U and V are irrelevant. // * 32 bytes of a scalar s' = k + C' * az // where k = H(z || m), with z = H(sk)[32..], and az = H(sk)[..32]. unsigned char random_output[64]; if (crypto_vrf_ietfdraft03_verify(random_output, crafted_msg, pk, proof, MESSAGE, MESSAGE_LEN)) printf(\"failed VRF\\n \\n\"); // Now we use the same key to create an ed25519 signature for the crafted message. Note // that the only 'trick' we are doing is asking the signer to sign a particular message, after // she has used the key to create a VRF proof. We do not access the secret key in any other way. crypto_sign_detached(sig, NULL, crafted_msg, 32, sk); if (crypto_sign_verify_detached(sig, crafted_msg, 32, pk)) printf(\"failed on ed25519 generation\"); // Now we should have a 64 bytes signature that corresponds to: // * first 32 bytes represent the point R = k * G, where k = H(z || m) // where z = H(sk)[32..] // * second 32 bytes represent a scalar s = k + az * HRAM // where HRAM = H(R || pk || m), and az = H(sk)[..32] }\n{ unsigned char sk[crypto_sign_SECRETKEYBYTES]; crypto_sign_keypair(pk, sk); // Now let's use these keys for vrf generation. crypto_vrf_ietfdraft03_prove(proof, sk, MESSAGE, MESSAGE_LEN); // Now, we have a proof that consists of 80 bytes that correspond to: // * 32 bytes of an EC point that we can ignore // * 16 bytes of a challenge C = H(pk, H, Gamma, U, V), where the values // of H, Gamma, U and V are irrelevant. // * 32 bytes of a scalar s' = k + C' * az // where k = H(z || m), with z = H(sk)[32..], and az = H(sk)[..32]. unsigned char random_output[64]; if (crypto_vrf_ietfdraft03_verify(random_output, crafted_msg, pk, proof, MESSAGE, MESSAGE_LEN)) printf(\"failed VRF\\n \\n\"); // Now we use the same key to create an ed25519 signature for the crafted message. Note // that the only 'trick' we are doing is asking the signer to sign a particular message, after // she has used the key to create a VRF proof. We do not access the secret key in any other way. crypto_sign_detached(sig, NULL, crafted_msg, 32, sk); if (crypto_sign_verify_detached(sig, crafted_msg, 32, pk)) printf(\"failed on ed25519 generation\"); // Now we should have a 64 bytes signature that corresponds to: // * first 32 bytes represent the point R = k * G, where k = H(z || m) // where z = H(sk)[32..] // * second 32 bytes represent a scalar s = k + az * HRAM // where HRAM = H(R || pk || m), and az = H(sk)[..32] }\nAs explained earlier, the issue arises due to the difference in challenges between the two algorithms. So, what does this mean? It means that an adversary can extract the secret key. To be more precise, we have the following: s - s' = (c - c') * az = az = (s - s') / (c - c')\ns - s' = (c - c') * az <=> az = (s - s') / (c - c')\nLet's try to extract the key:\nunsigned char c[64], cprime[32]; // First we need to compute c, as it is not given in the ed25519 signature. This is done // using public values. crypto_hash_sha512_state hs; crypto_hash_sha512_init(&hs); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs, sig, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs, pk, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs, crafted_msg, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_final(&hs, c); crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_reduce(c, c); // Now we simply copy the challenge into a 16 byte string memcpy(cprime, proof + 32, 16); memset(cprime + 16, 0, 16); // Just for sanity. // Now we have all we need, let's extract the secret. unsigned char cminuscprimeinv[32], extracted_skey[32], extracted_pkey[32]; crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_sub(extracted_skey, sig + 32, proof + 48); crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_sub(cminuscprimeinv, c, cprime); crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_invert(cminuscprimeinv, cminuscprimeinv); crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_mul(extracted_skey, extracted_skey, cminuscprimeinv); crypto_scalarmult_ed25519_base_noclamp(extracted_pkey, extracted_skey);\nunsigned char c[64], cprime[32]; // First we need to compute c, as it is not given in the ed25519 signature.

With the algorithm described above, we cannot access this preimage that the API expects. However, it's not necessary to have this missing data to forge a signature as we see below. It's worth noting that as a result, the adversary can also create invalid VRF proofs.\nunsigned char nonce_fake[32], challenge[64], sig_fake[64], reduced_c[32]; crypto_hash_sha512_state hs_f; unsigned char msg[32] = {0}; // commitment crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_random(nonce_fake); crypto_scalarmult_ed25519_base_noclamp(sig_fake, nonce_fake); // challenge crypto_hash_sha512_init(&hs_f); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs_f, sig_fake, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs_f, extracted_pkey, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs_f, msg, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_final(&hs_f, challenge); crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_reduce(reduced_c, challenge); // response crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_mul(sig_fake + 32, reduced_c, extracted_skey); crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_add(sig_fake + 32, sig_fake + 32, nonce_fake);\nunsigned char nonce_fake[32], challenge[64], sig_fake[64], reduced_c[32]; crypto_hash_sha512_state hs_f; unsigned char msg[32] = {0}; // commitment crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_random(nonce_fake); crypto_scalarmult_ed25519_base_noclamp(sig_fake, nonce_fake); // challenge crypto_hash_sha512_init(&hs_f); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs_f, sig_fake, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs_f, extracted_pkey, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_update(&hs_f, msg, 32); crypto_hash_sha512_final(&hs_f, challenge); crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_reduce(reduced_c, challenge); // response crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_mul(sig_fake + 32, reduced_c, extracted_skey); crypto_core_ed25519_scalar_add(sig_fake + 32, sig_fake + 32, nonce_fake);\nThe fake proof we generated could not be generated using the exposed API, but we can still use the usual API to verify it. This means there is no need to modify the verification algorithm to accept the crafted signatures:\nif (crypto_sign_verify_detached(sig_fake, msg, 32, pk)) printf(\"Failed to fake ed25519\\n\"); else printf(\"Successfully faked an ed25519 sig\\n\");\nif (crypto_sign_verify_detached(sig_fake, msg, 32, pk)) printf(\"Failed to fake ed25519\\n\"); else printf(\"Successfully faked an ed25519 sig\\n\");\nAfter running the script (details provided in the README.md file), it becomes apparent that we successfully faked the ed25519 signature!\nAlthough cryptographic algorithms should not be designed to share secret keys, it is unfortunately something that often attracts engineers. One proposal to address the issue of deterministic nonce generation (which also caused issues in some libraries with incorrect APIs) was to combine determinism with a secure source of randomness. This approach ensures that the algorithm would be flawed only if both sources failed.\nAnother simple solution is to use domain separation when computing the value of k. This involves using padding in the hash function, similar to the way suite_string is used in the output computation of the VRF (see standard draft), to ensure that there is no match between the randomness used in the VRF and that used in ed25519.\nk\nsuite_string\nHowever, as suggested in this blog post, the best solution is to avoid sharing secret keys among different cryptosystems altogether.\nThanks to my wonderful colleagues, Gamze Kilic, David Nevado, and Vanishree Rao for their comments and review!\nFor a non-expert reader, it is not necessary to understand the technical details behind the extraction of sk from pk. Rather, one should trust that this process is computationally difficult and that operations over elliptic curve points are associative and cyclic.\nA key derivation function can simply be seen as a function that, given a secret seed, derives some secret value in a deterministic way.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Voltaire A Ledger of Tourists, Residents, and Citizens?",
    "completion": "Voltaire is the name given to the next era of the Cardano core development roadmap (Bootstrap Period) that focuses on delivering Decentralised Governance functionality to the Cardano protocol and introducing a new framework of participants, roles, and actions, to the Cardano Ledger.\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or decisions of any other agency, organisation, or company. They are mostly based on CIP-1694 and other systems of governance used in previous eras of the Cardano blockchain.\nA government in any organized system assigns roles and responsibilities to participants, and provides checks and balances to ensure efficiency in how the system is progressed and maintained.\nWe see this in the US Government, for example, through law enforcement agents, judges, senators, and citizens. Another example is the bee colony system, which has a queen, drones, and workers.\nThis article aims to answer the following questions about Cardano's governance systems:\nHow are participants in Cardano classified according to their roles in the governance systems that have been in place in recent eras of the Cardano development roadmap?\nHow do these classifications impact the ranks, privileges, and abilities of participants of the Cardano protocol?\nHow will the Voltaire era define the system of governance and classifications of participants on Cardano?\nWhat real-world parallels/analogies can be drawn to describe the ranks and roles of participants, across the various development eras?\nLet's find out\nMost organized systems have core constructs i.e. rules(eg. Constitutions), processes(eg. Elections), and structures(eg. Parliaments), that participants follow to coordinate and make decisions. This helps them control, execute, and be accountable for common goals and resources in the system. This combination of core constructs enables participants to achieve consensus appropriately. When all participants in a system agree on the core constructs for achieving consensus, it results in a political engine called a government.\nA government is the accepted political engine for governance in an organized system. It determines how the fundamental principles to achieve consensus are created, modified, interpreted, and administered. Over time, governments have formed in many organized systems of participants to coordinate the masses for the purpose of pursuing progress and sustainability. We can see this in historical human systems, such as the Athenian Democracy and also in non-human systems, such as beehives, which are known as colonies.\nIn the real world, governments rule territories or nation states. These are organized systems inhabited by participants i.e. citizens, residents, and tourists. Each class of participant has its own specific rights and responsibilities. For example, citizens have the right to vote, residents have the right to access employment, and tourists have the right to access hospitality.\nThe Cardano blockchain protocol is another organised system that operates via a set of core constructs to achieve consensus in a variety of domains. It is also home to numerous participants.\nMuch like the organised systems discussed above, Cardano also has a government to steward the protocol towards progress and sustainability. These governments are instantiated specifically on the Cardano Ledger via a bespoke set of protocol rules and keys(and logic in Voltaire) which imbue special rights and privileges over the system.\nHereinafter, we will refer to the system of governance(and its participants) as the \"government\".\nSince its inception and as part of the Bootstrap Period, Cardano has had a unitary government instated to direct all governance actions and proposals such as protocol upgrades, and oversee the access and allocation of common resources such as the on-chain Treasury.\nThe government is made up of Cardano's founding entities, namely: Input Output, EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation. These entities operate as Primary Users on the Ledger.\nThe Cardano government has gradually distributed its authority and responsibilities to other participants over time, effectively promoting them to new ranks on the Cardano Ledger and giving them new roles in various domains, such as Consensus. Most of the advancements to the Cardano government system were initiated in the Shelley era and further improved in the eras that followed.\nLet's discuss how these Cardano governments and participants on the Ledger have evolved.\nThe Byron era of the Cardano development roadmap saw the initialisation of the Cardano blockchain protocol with early developments and events, including the dedicated research and development of Ouroboros POS, the creation of the Genesis block, initial distribution of the Ada cryptocurrency, and assignment of primary (governance) rights and controls to the founding entities of the Cardano project.\nFrom the perspective of the Ledger, this government recognised only two classes of participants: Genesis Key Holders (the founding entities), and Ada (Token) Stakeholders. Governance actions were reserved solely for the Genesis Key Holders.\nAt the Consensus level, the role of block production and validation was solely reserved for a federated set of nodes controlled by Cardano's founding entities.\nThis meant that Ada Stakeholders could not partake in governance actions or consensus work, and could only perform simple transactions, such as payments and remittances.\nGiven the rights and responsibilities reserved for the founding entities in the Byron Government System, we regard the following participants of the Cardano Ledger:\nGenesis Key Holders, as Primary Users or Governors.\nAda Stakeholders as Secondary Users or Tourists.\nThe Shelley era of the Cardano development roadmap introduced new features, major upgrades and changes that improved the Networking, Consensus, Ledger, and Execution layers of the Cardano protocol. The benefits of these improvements persisted and were further enhanced throughout the Goguen and Basho eras, which were accompanied by continuous feature additions.\nFrom the perspective of the Ledger, the current government (from Byron) retains their rights and duties as primary users. However, certain responsibilities and decision-making privileges were delegated to proxies, such as the Project Catalyst grants service.\nProject Catalyst functions as an innovation (grants) fund designed to help democratize the allocation of Cardano Treasury funds towards ecosystem development objectives and initiatives. It accomplishes this by receiving funding proposals from the general public and determining their acceptance or rejection through votes cast by all registered Ada Stakeholders. The grant fund determines which proposals get funded based on their alignment with community values and goals.\nAt the Consensus level, block production and validation transitioned from being strictly reserved for federated nodes controlled by the founding entities(Genesis Key Holders), to a hybrid model that added support for participation from Ada Stakeholders through directly staking their Ada (as validators), or delegating their stake to other validators(a.k.a. SPOs).\nThe Shelley era redefined the rankings of all participants in the new government system of the Cardano Ledger by creating new roles and responsibilities for entities other than the founding ones. Given the changes in this system, we regard the following participants of the Cardano Ledger:\nGenesis Key Holders, as Primary Users or Governors.\nAda Stakeholders that contribute to Consensus i.e. Validators and Stake Delegators, as Secondary Users or Residents.\nAda Stakeholders that do not contribute to Consensus, as Tertiary Users or Tourists.\nThe Voltaire era will completely revamp the governance system of the Cardano Ledger, introducing new functionality and provisions intended to democratize and distribute decision-making powers over the Cardano protocol and shared resources, such as the Cardano Treasury, to a wider range of participants.\nThe primary objective of the Voltaire era in protocol development is to eliminate special rights and privileges reserved for the set of Genesis Key Holders, who are Cardano's founding entities. This will be achieved by discarding the Genesis Keys, effectively dissolving them. As a result, the Shelley government system and the role of Governors will be completely replaced by the Voltaire government system.\nThe Voltaire government system will adopt the structure of a Constitutional Democratic Republic with a political system similar to that of a Federal government design.\nThe reason for this is that the Voltaire governance system will be limited by a Constitution that establishes a rule of law on the Cardano Ledger and its dependencies, including the Consensus Mechanism (Ouroboros), Execution Environment (Plutus), and Networking Infrastructure (P2P). This Constitution will serve as the primary reference for the kind of proposals and actions that can be legitimately executed.\nFrom the perspective of the Ledger, the Voltaire governance system will introduce three new classes of roles/entities:\nDelegated Representatives(DReps) - A set of governance agents that serve as Representatives for participants of the Cardano protocol who may not have the time or resources to be directly involved in governance processes, via the delegation of governance rights.\nConstitutional Committee - A set of elected personnel that function as overseers of all governance events and proposals to ensure that said events and proposals are rightfully within the limits of the Constitution, and are interpreted as best as possible to all.\nStake Pool Operators(SPOs) - During the Shelley era, Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) were responsible for producing and validating blocks while also serving as proxy staking providers (delegates) for their delegators, thereby securing and advancing the Cardano protocol at the consensus level. With the introduction of the Voltaire government, SPOs will be natively appointed as governance agents with roles and responsibilities similar to those of Decentralized Representative (DReps). However, unlike DReps, SPOs will not be able to receive delegations of governance rights from other participants.\nAt the Consensus level, everything will remain quite the same and function like that of the Shelley era.\nThe Voltaire governance system will redefine the rankings of all participants of the Cardano Ledger by introducing new roles and responsibilities. As a result, all participants will have the opportunity to ascend and become Primary Users of Cardano, much like the founding entities in the Byron and Shelley eras. In light of the improvements that the Voltaire system will bring, the following participants of the Cardano Ledger will be regarded as:\n(Registered) Governance Participants, as Primary Users or Citizens\nAda Stakeholders that contribute only to Consensus via Stake Delegation, as Secondary Users or Residents.\nAda Stakeholders that DO NOT contribute to Consensus or Governance on the Ledger, as Tertiary Users or Tourists.\nBy now, with the help of real-world analogies and examples, we should have a good mental model of how the participants of the Cardano protocol are classified and how their classifications affect their ranks, privileges, and abilities in the system. We also learn how these participants and their classifications have evolved as the various eras of Cardano have progressed.\nThe Voltaire era marks a transformative phase in the history of Cardano, where the future of governance and stakeholder participation will be reshaped. With a renewed focus on credible decentralisation, it presents an opportunity for many users to finally become true citizens of Cardano and contribute to the protocol in more impactful ways than ever.\nCardano Governance, IO https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/reference/cardano-governance.md\nCardano Roadmap, Cardano.org https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/\nCardano Treasury with Kevin Hammond, QA DAO https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/community-governance-oversight/parameters/governance-parameters/cardano-treasury-with-kevin-hammond\nCIP-1694, IO https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/blob/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694/README.md\nAge of Voltaire: The end of the Bootstrapping Period, Emmanuel Batse https://twitter.com/thepizzaknight_/status/1598069184826863618?s=20\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Chain comparisons?",
    "completion": "Cardano and Bitcoin bear some fundamental differences in terms of design, purpose, and usability.\nCardano uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while Bitcoin relies on proof of work to mine new coins and add blocks to the chain. Functionally, Bitcoin is designed to transfer digital currency in a decentralized, peer-to-peer fashion. Cardano, on the other hand, supports a much broader range of functions. Cardano can handle smart contracts, custom tokens, and decentralized applications (DApps).\nAnother key difference between Cardano and Bitcoin is the energy utilization. Bitcoin's proof-of-work design consumes huge amounts of energy, to the tune of 204.50 Terawatts/hour. Cardano is far more environmentally sustainable. Charles Hoskinson estimates that Cardano s electricity consumption is about 0.01 of Bitcoin s.\nCardano differs from Ethereum in fundamental ways.\nCardano is designed as a proof-of-stake blockchain. The transformation of the Ethereum chain from proof of work to proof of stake was the main motivation for ETH2.0 and the Merge.\nCardano and Ethereum feature different staking systems. Cardano users delegate their ada to stake pools run by SPOs, while Ethereum does not natively support delegation.\nEthereum users can either run their own validating node, stake through a third-party operator as a service, or stake through pooled staking. Solo home staking on Ethereum requires a minimum of 32 ETH and a dedicated computer connected to the internet 24/7, while staking as a service and pooled staking also have their own constraints. Ethereum penalizes a validator that acts against the network through slashing.\nOn Cardano, Ouroboros provides incentives for good behavior instead. Each SPO pledges funds to their pool to make it more attractive and earn a higher percentage of rewards. Dishonest behavior will result in loss of rewards. Leading-edge game theory techniques have contributed to this strategy too.\nFinally, staking on Cardano is more convenient than on Ethereum as there is no locking (users can withdraw ada at any time), there is no minimum stake requirement, rewards get automatically assigned, and the custody always remains with an ada holder.\nFor more details on staking see this comparison and an infographic.\nAlso, Cardano supports custom tokens natively, without the need for smart contracts. Ethereum does support custom tokens also, but requires smart contracts, which adds a layer of complexity and the possibility of errors. In Cardano, the ledger handles all token functionality.\nAnother fundamental difference is the accounting model. Cardano features an extended unspent transaction output (EUTXO) model. Ethereum uses an account-based ledger model. This is significant for many reasons. For example, Cardano's model enables simpler transaction verification as each individual UTXO can only be consumed once, and as whole. Ethereum's transaction logic is more complex, as each individual transaction updates the global state of the chain. Because Ethereum s transactions are processed sequentially, parallelization is hard to implement, to the detriment of throughput.\nCardano's EUTXO accounting model is deterministic, meaning transactions can be validated beforehand. Fees and transaction outcomes are predictable. Also, if a transaction fails the phase 1 validation, no fees are taken. This is not the case in an account-based model, like Ethereum, where users will lose all paid fees in this same scenario.\nCardano and Polkadot share a common starting point: the resolution of some of the shortcomings inherent to Ethereum's design, including chronic network congestion, high gas fees, unpredictable transaction outcomes, etc.\nThe chains' evolutionary paths diverged, however, as both chains differ in substantive ways, starting with their consensus mechanisms. Cardano uses proof of stake, whereas Polkadot relies on a variation of this system, called Nominated Proof of Stake, which is designed with the roles of validators and nominators to maximize chain security. Validators produce new blocks, validate parachain blocks, and guarantee finality. Nominators can choose to back select validators with their stake. Nominators can approve candidates that they trust and back them with their tokens. Polkadot s design was in fact heavily influenced by Cardano.\nAnother fundamental difference is in the chains' architecture. Cardano's design includes three layers (consensus, ledger, and network), whereas Polkadot's architecture is anchored on a single layer, the Relay Chain.\nThere are some similarities between Cardano and Solana, and the media often refers to both chains as direct rivals . Both chains use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, for example, but Solana adds a technology known as proof of history, where consensus is achieved by the validation of the time difference between two events on the blockchain. Proof of history enables timestamps to be built on the blockchain itself (rather than relying on off-chain programs to calculate time, like Ethereum does). Proof-of-history technology is achieved through a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF).\nBut in stark contrast to Cardano, the Solana blockchain is not as decentralized. It has been reported that almost 50 of all Solana's tokens are owned by venture capital entities, the blockchain's developers, and the Solana Labs company. Also, the Solana Foundation is currently the only entity able to add new blocks to the chain.\nAnother well-known trait of the Solana blockchain is the costly hardware requirements needed for running a validator node. Cardano's nodes can be run efficiently with far lower hardware specs.\nCardano offers liquid staking without slashing, so there is no risk for delegators to lose funds. In contrast, the Solana delegation system does involve slashing, so delegators can lose funds.\nCardano's strength and resilience lie in peer-reviewed research and design principles.\nCardano and Algorand have some similarities.\nBoth are backed by strong academic research (Algorand was founded by an MIT professor and Turing award winner), and both emphasize decentralization as a core tenet.\nCardano and Algorand operate proof-of-stake consensus protocols, which means significantly better energy efficiency and faster transaction times than proof-of-work chains like Ethereum or Bitcoin. But each chain uses a different implementation of the consensus mechanism. Algorand implements what it calls Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS), which randomly selects a token holder as the next block producer. The block then needs to be approved by 1,000 validators before being added to the chain. Cardano uses Ouroboros, the first provably secure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\nCardano is written in Haskell (with Plutus as its scripting language), while Algorand uses JavaScript, Python, Java, and Go.\nBoth chains also differ in their core architecture: Algorand features two layers, whereas Cardano uses three.\nIn terms of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Algorand users can create NFTs using a system built into the protocol, without the need for smart contracts. Cardano users can create NFTs in a variety of ways.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Why Secure Crypto Key Management is Crucial for Cardano Project Integrations?",
    "completion": "In the world of blockchain, private keys are used to authorize various types of transactions, like withdrawing assets or accessing wallets and accounts. What are they? Private keys are essentially secret code that is linked to a specific digital asset address or set of addresses and used to sign transactions on the blockchain network. The owner of the private key has complete control over the associated digital assets, and it is crucial to keep keys secure to prevent unauthorized access or theft of the assets.\nFor Cardano projects and businesses, those that ignore safeguarding their private keys do so at their own peril. Having a robust crypto key management system in place prioritizes the safety of user funds, mitigates against integration risks with other Cardano projects, and safeguards capital investments by providing:\nIncreased security for your users\nReduced risk of failure or human error\nAbility to scale\nCompliance with regulatory requirements (generally for offerings extending beyond a crypto-native world, like our Anzens platform)\nFor this article, we examine the importance of crypto key management and the various ways that projects and businesses can secure private keys some of which are not readily available for projects building on Cardano at this time. We identify why the challenges faced by Cardano projects exist, discuss how we built customized architecture for the Anzens USDA platform to work around the challenges, and finally encourage the Cardano community to join us as we promote new solutions for the ecosystem.\nBy sharing the insights that we ve learned throughout the Anzens USDA stablecoin development, we hope to contribute to the overall success and adoption of the Cardano ecosystem.\nSelf-custodying digital assets means one has complete control of their wallet s private keys. There are pros and cons to self-custodying your crypto. For example, when a person decides to take complete control over their assets, they have the ability to freely move their assets without third-party involvement, which is inevitably quicker. On the other hand, self-custody requires technical knowledge of this process and the risk of exposing your sensitive information as it relates to your digital assets. Normally, self-custody is a single signature arrangement but it could also involve multiple signatures by various parties normally within the same organization.\nSingle signature\nMulti-signature\nSigning arrangements that involve external co-signers require that owners keep two private keys and give up control to at least one other private key, normally outside of the organization.\nExternal co-signers\nThird-party custody means an owner has relinquished all access and custody of private keys to a third party. The third-party will custody and store your crypto assets without the individual or organization managing their own assets. Those who feel comfortable with allowing outside entities to manage their assets have the freedom of not worrying about their own assets. Yet, projects who utilize third-party custody face risks of potential collusion, illegitimate ownership claims by third parties working against their interests, and insolvency, or bankruptcy risks of their custodian. If an outside factor limits or disrupts the third party s operations, your assets could even become lost.\nThird-party custody\nIn an MPC-based key management arrangement, the private key is divided into several parts and distributed among multiple parties, also known as shares . These shares are then used collectively to generate the private key, which is used for signing transactions. A few benefits to MPC custody include no point of failure and full user control.\nHowever, like any security solution, MPC custody is not foolproof and has some potential vulnerabilities. For example, if the MPC implementation is flawed or the parties involved in the custody agreement collude, the security of the assets or data could be compromised. In addition, the parties must be able to communicate securely and reliably to ensure that the custody arrangement functions as intended.\nOverall, MPC custody is considered to be a highly secure method of protecting digital assets and sensitive data, but it is important to implement it correctly and be aware of potential vulnerabilities. It is also recommended to use additional security measures, such as regular audits, to further enhance the security of MPC custody solutions.\nMulti-layer security solutions are sophisticated key management infrastructures that utilize a combination of MPC plus other hardware and software technologies to create layers of security to mitigate crypto key risks.\nThese Key Management Systems (KMS) are typically proprietary architectures offered to businesses by KMS providers, such as Ledger and Fireblocks.\nAs we discuss more below, KMS providers have yet to expand their offerings to include support beyond Cardano s ADA, resulting in a lack of support for Cardano Native Assets.\n_For additional terms, check out our helpful Key Management glossary_\nHardware Security Module (HSM) - a specialized hardware device designed to manage digital keys, perform cryptographic operations, and protect sensitive data in a secure and tamper-evident manner.\nKey Management System (KMS) - a software-based solution designed to manage cryptographic keys and provide a secure way to store and use them for various cryptographic operations. KMS is often used for managing encryption keys, signing keys, and other types of keys used in cryptographic protocols.\nSoftware Guard Extensions (SGX) - a hardware-based security technology developed by Intel. It provides a secure enclave for applications to run in, isolating them from the rest of the system and protecting their data and code from unauthorized access or modification.\nNow that we ve discussed the various arrangements to secure private keys, we ll turn next to Cardano s innovative architecture and discuss the surrounding infrastructure supporting key management on Cardano.\nWhat we ve learned from developing the USDA stablecoin for the Anzens platform is that building a robust key management system on Cardano is currently a challenge. One of the main issues we encountered is that most of the available KMS/HSM/SGX solutions do not support the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) used by Cardano, which provides strong security with shorter keys and signatures. Moreover, these solutions do not support all of the capabilities native to Cardano, such as native assets, staking, and pool management, making holistic integration difficult.\nAlthough KMS providers have sophisticated solutions for generating, distributing, and managing crypto keys at scale, integrating them with Cardano projects would require customized architecture, which is a significant effort and financial commitment. Therefore, until KMS providers innovate and begin supporting Cardano s architecture, these options are not currently available to projects building on Cardano.\nRead more: How Cardano s Fiat-Backed USDA Stablecoin Handles Depegging\nAs the developers of Cardano fiat-backed stablecoin USDA, we must be vigilant to threats and opportunities for unauthorized access to our private keys. Take as an example, the importance of keeping safe the private keys that authorize the minting of USDA stablecoin, which is meant to occur based on user demand with a corresponding cash deposit in the user s Anzens account. Illegitimate minting of USDA stablecoin could occur if an unauthorized person gains access to these keys. As you can imagine, one essential area (among others) that we have spent a great amount of time on is the key management system that will keep our private keys safe and secure. (Additional safeguards that are in place to protect against illegitimate USDA minting are not the subject of this blog and we are looking forward to it being revealed in our technical whitepaper to be released later on.)\nTo ensure that Cardano s USDA stablecoin on the Anzens platform is one of the most secure and robust projects on the market, despite the lack of KMS provider options available, we have taken two key steps.\nFirstly, we have invested in developing a customized technology infrastructure (tech stack) to integrate with one of the top Key Management Solutions (KMS) providers on the market. This means that our private keys used for signing transactions related to USDA stablecoin will be secured using some of the best technology and systems available within the Cardano ecosystem and in the industry as a whole with a combination of MPC and layered security measures.\nSecondly, as a division of EMURGO, a founding entity of Cardano, we are engaging with KMS providers to encourage them to naturally support Cardano s native assets, so that new architecture could be built for integration. By showcasing the growing user base on Cardano, we hope to broaden the perspectives of KMS providers to support Cardano, and in turn, save other projects building on Cardano from the need to develop custom tech stacks. You can find more information on the data we have gathered in-house on Cardano in the PDF here. Screenshots have been provided below for ease of reference.\nWe encourage Cardano projects and businesses to join us in starting conversations with KMS providers to support Cardano Native Assets, just like we re doing.\nThe security of private keys is critical to our users, project integrations, and capital investments so much so that as the developers of Anzens USDA stablecoin we invested capital to build custom tech architecture to integrate with a top KMS provider.\nLet s work together to create a brighter future for Cardano and emphasize why good crypto key management is crucial for all projects building on Cardano!\nJoin the USDA stablecoin waitlist\nUSDA Cardano s first USD-backed stablecoin for the ecosystem is scheduled to launch in early 2023 and bring value to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of decentralized applications.

    "prompt": "UPDATE Cardano CrossChain Bridges and Other Interoperability Solutions?",
    "completion": "TL;DR Decentralised, non-custodial, bi-directional cross-chain bridges are officially up and running on Cardano Pre-Production! This means that ADA, other native Cardano tokens, and all erc20 tokens can seamlessly move between Cardano and any EVM-based network! Next step? Mainnet!\nLast July, the team at Wanchain shared details about their ongoing work with IOG and MLabs to make Cardano interoperable. The goal was to build the infrastructure required to enable applications spanning multiple blockchains, thereby driving the adoption of Cardano s ecosystem, promoting Wanchain s network-agnostic cross-chain infrastructure, and advancing the future of Web3.\nThis monumental endeavour consisted of two foundational blocks. The first: infrastructure to enable decentralised cross-chain bridges connecting Cardano to heterogeneous blockchain networks both EVM and non-EVM. The second: a novel sidechain solution to further secure Cardano s cross-chain bridges and transactions.\nNow, after hitting several significant development milestones, it s finally time to share this highly anticipated update!\nAs previously explained, making Cardano interoperable is a complex undertaking. The primary reason is that Cardano is fundamentally different to most other blockchain networks. Specifically, Cardano uses:\nDifferent smart contract environments and programming languages: Cardano uses Plutus and Haskell, not EVM and Solidity;\nDifferent transaction models: Cardano uses a UTXO model (like Bitcoin), not an account-based model (like Ethereum);\nDifferent signature schemes and elliptic curves: Cardano supports EdDSA and Curve25519, not Shnorr and Secp256k1.\nSince the last update, the Wanchain team has fully developed the Haskell smart contracts needed to support cross-chain transactions. Wanchain s bridge nodes have also been updated and can now construct UTXO transactions to call Cardano smart contracts. Finally, following a request from Wanchain and MLabs, Input Output coordinated internal efforts to add native support for a Schnorr signature and Secp256k1 curve. Both have been publicly available on the Cardano mainnet since the Valentine update on February 14th, 2023.\nNow that these three areas have been fully resolved, it is with great pleasure to announce that Cardano cross-chain bridges are fully functional on Pre-Production.\nPre-Production is Cardano s most mature late-stage testnet. It follows Devnet and Preview and is designed to closely resemble the Cardano mainnet as it serves as the final step before deploying applications on the Cardano Mainnet. The following decentralised, non-custodial, bi-directional cross-chain bridge types are currently deployed to Pre-Production:\nMove ADA to any EVM-compatible chain and back\nMove Cardano native tokens to any EVM-compatible chain and back\nMove any coin or ERC20 token from any EVM-compatible chain to Cardano and back\nThe advantages of these bridges are plentiful. They enable users to use their ADA and other Cardano native tokens like DJED with any Web3 application on any EVM-compatible network. Similarly, these bridges benefit the entire Cardano ecosystem by paving the way for a huge influx of new assets and liquidity.\nFrom here, it is relatively straightforward to connect Cardano to the non-EVM networks already supported by Wanchain s cross-chain infrastructure, such as Bitcoin, Polkadot and the XRP Ledger, amongst others. Once deployed on the Cardano mainnet, the first foundational block needed to make Cardano interoperable will be realised!\nSince the last update outlining how Wanchain will serve as an EVM-compatible sidechain to Cardano, IOG published extensive sidechain specifications aimed at improving Cardano s scalability. The design of these specifications positions the Cardano mainnet as the root of trust for multiple other networks and sidechains, enabling developers to securely build on Cardano sidechains rather than directly on the Cardano mainnet. As such, small adjustments are in order to ensure alignment with IOG s sidechain specifications. Additionally, there are numerous elements of Wanchain s interoperability solutions that will add value.\nWanchain s existing interoperability solutions include components that can serve as building blocks for Cardano sidechains. These include blockchain followers, relayers, secure multiparty computation, secure validator registration, staking functions and more. These can expand the scope of Cardano s sidechains as Wanchain s solutions are already compatible with non-OBFT- and UTXO-compatible blockchains.\nIOG s sidechain specifications allow sidechains to stake and register Stake Pool Operators (SPO). Wanchain s enterprise-stack and related technologies can also be adapted to provide a Cardano sidechain solution to enterprises.\nIOG s sidechain specification describes a mechanism for validating sidechain transactions on the mainchain through certificates. Wanchain s ongoing research into Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology can complement this approach. ZKPs are designed to prove a fact without revealing private information and therefore provide strong security without any external assumptions while simultaneously reducing on-chain verification costs.\nMore detailed information about Wanchain s Cardano sidechain solution will be shared at a later date.\nWanchain has long been at the forefront of blockchain interoperability. From launching the industry s first decentralised cross-chain bridge, to deploying the first direct bridge connecting Bitcoin and Ethereum, to more recent innovations like NFT bridges and XFlows, Wanchain continues to earn its reputation for enabling interoperability between EVM and non-EVM networks.\nWith Cardano set to join more than 20 other public networks connected by Wanchain s cross-chain infrastructure, Wanchain s original vision of blockchain interoperability is closer than ever. Get involved with the Wanchain community of developers, users and ambassadors by joining us on Telegram and by following Wanchain on Twitter. We are all connected.\nWe are all connected Wanchain, the Wide Area Network chain, is the world s premier decentralised blockchain interoperability solution.

    "prompt": "Maintaining Stability How Cardanos FiatBacked USDA Stablecoin Handles Depegging?",
    "completion": "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain price stability and are pegged to an external asset. These assets are viewed as one of the backbones of cryptocurrency and DeFi but can face the risk of depegging if not properly managed. Depegging refers to the phenomenon of a stablecoin deviating from its intended peg. We saw a hallmark example of a catastrophic depegging with Terra and its algorithmic stablecoin LUNA s UST. This was a result of a concentrated selling of UST combined with a lack of reserves and liquidity that disabled the issuer from being able to maintain its peg.\nUSDA, Cardano s native stablecoin, is fully backed 1:1 to USD. The difference between algorithmic stablecoin UST and fiat-backed USDA is that a fiat-backed stablecoin losing its peg has a much higher probability of returning 1:1 to its paired asset because it s entirely backed by cash or cash-like reserves. An algorithmic design, which relies on math and code to balance stablecoin issuance against tokenized collateral, may not be as reliable as USDA to regain its peg. Because USDA is fully backed 1:1 to deposits, the USDA stablecoin has been designed to maintain stability, even in the face of market fluctuations. That design is on purpose and is the key to the stablecoin s stability the antidote to the kryptonite in this analogy.\nA major depegging event could result from a large-scale cash-out where a plurality of USDA holders rush to cash out their assets to a different currency (fiat or another asset). The supply and demand dynamics are the same as any other cryptocurrency, thus creating prices higher or less than $1 at any given time. But any depegging on USDA should be temporary, in the event it takes place. The USDA stablecoin is designed to operate by minting or burning USDA coins at a fixed exchange rate of 1 USDA to 1 USD based on user demand, ensuring that each USDA coin is backed by a corresponding US dollar held by our regulated US banking partner.\nFundamentally, all stabilization techniques are based on the elementary economic model of supply and demand. The key to avoiding depegging is understanding how reserves are managed to ensure 1:1 backing. Asset liquidity becomes key here. The pegged USD is custodied by a regulated US banking partner who keeps proper accounting of the cash reserves, making funds available at a moment s notice. In the event of market volatility causing our stablecoin to depeg below a dollar, EMURGO or any other party would be in a position to purchase USDA on the market and sell it on Anzens, presenting a low-risk arbitrage opportunity. We will provide further information on our reserves in the coming months, including monthly attestation reports which are reports that are used to provide a snapshot of the reserves and assets that back USDA and a technical whitepaper.\nMitigating risk as it relates to USDA is critical to not only the health of the Cardano ecosystem, but also to its utility in achieving the vision of EMURGO Fintech s Anzens platform, which includes a suite of Web3 enterprise and individual financial services applications.\nRead more: How fiat-backed stablecoins like USDA benefit the Cardano blockchain ecosystem\nIt is unlikely that a single design is optimal for all use cases. Which stablecoin is best depends upon a wide variety of competing factors, including intended use, degree of desired trust minimization and decentralization, regulatory jurisdictional compliance, and scalability. The Cardano ecosystem supports a number of stablecoin designs for this very reason.\nEMURGO Fintech s USDA provides Web3 organizations and individuals with a viable option to shelter from market volatility and will usher in more opportunities for real-world use cases. And with the Anzens platform and product suite, USDA will be the stable asset that provides interoperability between traditional finance and decentralized finance.\n![$USDA-Cardano-Blockchain-Stablecoin](https://emurgo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/USDA-1024x218.png \"Maintaining Stability: How Cardano's Fiat-Backed USDA Stablecoin Handles Depegging 1\")\n![$USDA-Cardano-Blockchain-Stablecoin](https://emurgo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/USDA-1024x218.png \"Maintaining Stability: How Cardano's Fiat-Backed USDA Stablecoin Handles Depegging 1\")\nUSDA Cardano s regulatory-compliant USD-backed stablecoin for the ecosystem is scheduled to launch in early 2023 and bring value to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of decentralized applications. USDA will be a native token to the Cardano blockchain that is backed 1:1 by real-world reserves.

Se considera que estos activos son una de las columnas vertebrales de las criptomonedas y la financiaci n descentraliza (DeFi), pero pueden enfrentarse al riesgo de desvinculaci n si no se gestionan adecuadamente.\nDepegging [ despegarse o desvincularse en espa ol] se refiere al fen meno de que una moneda estable se desv e de su vinculaci n.\nHemos presenciado un ejemplo emblem tico de desvinculaci n catastr fica con Terra y UST de su moneda estable algor tmica LUNA, a consecuencia de una venta concentrada de UST combinada con una falta de reservas y liquidez que impidi al emisor poder mantener su paridad.\nUSDA, la moneda estable nativa de Cardano, cuenta con un respaldo total 1:1 a USD. A diferencia de la moneda estable UST algor tmica y la USDA respaldada por fiat, una moneda estable respaldada por fiat que pierde su paridad tiene una probabilidad mucho mayor de volver 1:1 a su activo emparejado porque est totalmente respaldada por efectivo o reservas similares al efectivo. Es posible que un dise o algor tmico, que se basa en las matem ticas y el c digo para equilibrar la emisi n de moneda estable frente a la garant a tokenizada, no sea tan fiable como la USDA para recuperar su paridad. Dado que la USDA est totalmente respaldada 1:1 por los dep sitos, la moneda estable USDA ha sido dise ada para mantener la estabilidad, incluso frente a las fluctuaciones del mercado.

    "prompt": "Oracles on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Blockchain Oracles is a very important piece of blockchain and we have learned through a series of articles about oracles by the authors team. And Cardano isnt an exception, Oracles will be the gateway connecting Cardano to the world outside it. However, to build an oracles project on a special ecosystem like Cardano is not easy. Here we will learn about how Oracles are and will be developed on Cardano.\nThe first and also very familiar to many people is thinking of projects and teams specializing in building and developing Oracles networks. Since last year there have been a lot of statements or announcement made by some teams.\nA. Chainlink.\nDuring the Cardano summit in October 2021, Cardano announced a partnership with Chainlink to develop Oracles. Chainlink will become a partner providing their network resources to Cardano.\nThis is a necessary combination because Chainlink is the largest network of Oracles in the current blockchain with thousands of combined projects. Along with a huge data source, network across blockchains and a professional development team.\nChainlink promises to be an important link for the development of Oracles on Cardano. But up to now, it has been 1 year, we still have not seen many appearances of the name Chainlink on Cardano's ecosystem.\nThis can be explained by the following reasons:\n1 . The crypto market is in downtrend, transactions or projects are not as active as in 2021.\n2 . The Dapps on Cardano have not actually exploded or are still in the building phase.\n3 . The difference in Cardano's smart contract language (Plutus) and the core smart contract language Chainlink built from the begining (Solidity).\nThus, it will also take time for Cardano and Chainlink to find a common voice with each other. But it's still a promising combination.\nB. Charli3\nThe first Oracles project to announce that it will build Oracles on top of Cardano. When it first appeared in the middle of 2021, Charli3 received a lot of attentions and expectations. But it also comes with disappointment when up to the present time Charli3 has not met the community's expectations.\nLooking at it objectively, Charli3 still needs a lot of time to build a good oracles protocol on Cardano. Difficult jobs that they need to do such as:\n1. Build a network of nodes.\n2. Build a smart contract framework.\n3. Connect to quality data sources.\nIn the elements mentioned above, it seems that the second element is being well implemented by Charli3. They showed how oracles (plutus) smart contracts should work on Cardano.\nThis smart contract is also audited by Certik. This is something that even Chainlink has not been able to do. The author will present Charli3's oracles operating model in another article because this may be a worthwhile operating model for projects that want to build Oracles that can run on the eUTXO ledger system.\nC. Other projects.\nAt the time of writing, there are also a number of other projects that claim to build the Oracles network on Cardano such as API3, Piggy or Orcfax. But in general, they are just statements and do not actually do anything.\nAPI3 : An Oracles project which is also quite famous in 2021 and considers itself a \"Chainlink killer\". However, API3 just stopped and announced that they would build Oracles on Cardano, but did not do anything.\nPiggy: This could be an interesting project. The Piggy project came out around Q4 of 2021 and is supposed to build Oracles on top of Cardano. But only until 2022, this project did nothing but call to attract token stakes, sell tokens for profit.\nOrcfax: This project gives very little information on how they will implement the construction of the Oracles network. And they also have a period of about half a year of downtime without knowing the reason.\nIn a short video broadcast on youtube at the end of 2020, Charles Hokinson - CEO of Cardano shared about the idea of building a decentralized Oracles network for the Cardano ecosystem. From the author's personal perspective, this is a very interesting idea and fits well with Cardano's philosophy of building an ecosystem.\nWhat elements does a network of Oracles need? a. Diverse and reliable data sources. b. A system or platform that computes, analyzes, and validates the accuracy of data. c. A network of participating actors providing and transferring that data in the blockchain\nIn the above shared clip, there are 3 important components mentioned: Singularity.Net, Wolfram Alpha and node operators (SPO).\n1 . Wolfram Alpha\nAs a platform that provides a variety of solutions to analyze and calculate data in accordance with web3 standards. Wolfram also owns a huge real-life data source that allows users to look up and collect a lot of necessary information.\nMany large companies around the world use Wolfram's services or are partners, it can be said that this is the first important piece of the puzzle that Cardano has achieved. Thus, Wolfram Alpha will correspond to the factor \"a\" mentioned above.\n2 . Singularity.Net\nThe information and data put into the blockchain is extremely diverse and decentralized. So to be able to authenticate and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data included in the Oracles contracts, it is necessary to have a platform that can compute and analyze them. Singularity with the power of AI will be a great tool to help the data about Oracles be processed correctly.\nBeside the core part of AI technology, Singularity also has projects in their ecosystem set up to collect data from sources around the world. Eg - Collaborate with Ocean protocol to collect data about all Defi related events in blockchain. - Developing the Nunet project specializing in decentralized computing and decentralized shared data storage. So Singularity will correspond to the factor \"b\"\n3 . SPO\nThe last component is the pool operators (SPO), it can be said that SPO are the people who will maintain, operate and develop the Cardano ecosystem in the future. All benefits and risks are closely associated with SPO. So the SPO will play the main role as the processor of Oracles contracts, operating the decentralized Oracles system for Cardano.\nAs the author mentioned in the first article in this series, the essence of blockchain oracles is simply putting real-life data into a blockchain to satisfy a certain request arising from that blockchain. So it is not necessary to rely on specify platforms to be able to deploy blockchain oracles.\nLooking at the image above, it looks like a lot of Cardano's current development direction for SPO. Then the Oracles system in the future will be a position of great benefit to SPOs if they know how to operate it properly.\nSPO in Cardano can take advantage of pre-built platforms by Cardano like Singularity, Wolfram Alpha, professional oracles networks like Chainlink. In the future when SPOs can operate Hydra, Sidechain, the amount of on-chain data that SPO owns will be of great value.\nThrough this article, we can see how Oracles will develop on Cardano in the future. There will be professional platforms like Chainlink, Charli3...will have a system of SPOs supported by Cardano to participate in providing Oracles services.\nAll will be oriented in a decentralized way and follow the most basic concepts of blockchain Oracles. In the following articles we will go into depth about how a blockchain oracles model can work on Cardano.\nSources: https://vcoincheck.io/cardano-knowledge/LB120221117085228\nClip community sharing knowledge about Oracles of Vcoincheck team (Vietnamese language)\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "IOG Academy The pathway to becoming a Cardano smart contract developer?",
    "completion": "As the Cardano blockchain evolves by integrating more features and development tools, the interest in developing smart contracts on Cardano is increasing. So, as we start a new year, the Input Output Global (IOG) Education team, want to share in this post the pathway you can follow to get started with Cardano s smart contract development and the resources we provide to support your learning journey.\nThe IOG Academy is an initiative of the IOG Education team to enable software developers and financial professionals to develop smart contracts on Cardano.\nThrough this educational initiative, we provide open courses, technical guides, playbooks, and Q&A sessions to connect with the Cardano development community and support our learners.\nIf you are new to developing smart contracts on Cardano, you should know that there are two native programming languages you can use: Marlowe and Plutus.\nMarlowe is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for the financial industry. This language was designed to be used by someone who is an expert in the field of financial contracts or business, but does not have programming skills and experience. It allows you to build contracts visually and in more traditional code.\nPlutus is the native smart contract programming language for Cardano. It is a Turing-complete language written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs. If you want to start with Plutus, having previous programming experience will help. The first stage of creating smart contracts using Plutus is learning the Haskell programming language and the functional programming paradigm.\nGetting into these languages may sound challenging, but we are here to guide you through your learning process with the resources we have outlined in this post.\nIn the next section, we provide you with the learning paths you can follow to develop your smart contacts for Cardano.\nWhether you are a software developer or a financial professional, you can get started with smart contract development by following the paths displayed in the image below:\nFigure 1: Learning paths\nAs you see in the previous image, there are two ways to develop smart contracts for Cardano. If you are a software developer or have previous programming experience, you can follow the path of learning the Haskell fundamentals. Next, you can move forward with the advanced Haskell skills to progress into Plutus and become a Cardano smart contract developer.\nIn the second path, you may be a finance or business expert. You have little or no coding experience and are interested in using blockchain technology to create financial smart contracts. To follow this path, you need to learn Marlowe; optionally, you can also learn the Haskell fundamentals; after that, you will be able to create your financial smart contracts from scratch or from pre-built templates provided to become a Cardano financial smart contract developer.\nRegardless of your chosen path, in the following sections, you will find the educational resources we provide to assist you in your learning journey.\nAs we said before, you can follow this path if you are developing software or you have previous programming experience. Let s explore the resources we provide to assist you in developing smart contracts on Cardano.\nTo get started with Haskell, we provide a self-paced Haskell Bootcamp course that introduces you to Haskell fundamentals in the first fifteen lessons. For every lesson, we provide you with a video lecture, an interactive coding environment based on Jupyter notebooks, and homework assignments to put your new Haskell skills into action.\nFigure 2: Haskell Fundamentals learning path\nYou can take this course completely free and review the detailed syllabus using the following links:\nThe Haskell Bootcamp Course on GitHub\nThe Haskell Bootcamp Course in our e-learning platform\nBoth resources offer the same learning content; the main difference is that if you get enrolled in our e-learning platform, you can share your questions and interact with other learners by using the discussion forums provided for each lesson. For both options, you can also hang out and discuss with other students through the IOG's technical community on Discord by checking out the #ask-haskell channel.\nThis course is offered in English; if you are a Spanish speaker and want to contribute to translating the course, we encourage you to fork the GitHub repository and share your contributions through a pull request.\nAfter completing the first fifteen lessons of our Haskell course, congratulate yourself on becoming a beginner Haskell programmer!\nFigure 3: Advanced Haskell learning path\nNow, you are ready to embrace more advanced concepts. To do so, we provide nine lessons (from lesson 16 to 24) that you can find either in the GitHub repository or on our e-learning platform.\nNote that these lessons are under development as of the date of this publication.\nOnce you have learned Haskell by either following our course, reading a book, or if you are already familiar with Haskell, you are ready to get started with Plutus.\nFigure 4: Plutus learning path\nWe provide the Plutus Pioneer Program to support you on this learning journey. This is an educational program to train software developers in Plutus for the Cardano ecosystem.\nWe are pleased to announce that our next course is starting on February 20th, so if you are interested in joining this new cohort, please complete the registration form, and we ll be in touch with you very soon.\nThis is a highly interactive program, with weekly videos, exercises, and Q&A sessions, along with exclusive access to the creators and key experts in the language. It runs for ten weeks, requiring a minimum commitment of ten hours per week of your time and effort.\nTo prepare for this course, you can go through the content of the Haskell Bootcamp to learn more about Haskell. If you want to get started with Plutus, or if you want to learn more about this program, we encourage you to review the Plutus Pioneer Program information page and the previous Plutus Pioneer Program lectures on GitHub.\nThis learning path is designed to encourage financial and business professionals, even with no coding experience, to jump into Cardano and create financial smart contracts using Marlowe and, optionally, Haskell.\nFigure 5: Marlowe learning path\nTo support you in learning Marlowe, we provide the Marlowe Pioneers Program. This educational program is designed to train developers and anyone interested in decentralized finance products to write financial smart contracts (such as loans, swaps, CFDs, and so on) using the Marlowe product suite.\nThis is a seven week course. Every week includes a live lesson followed by a Q&A session. Additional coursework of between 1 to 5 hours will be required during the week, depending on your skill level and availability.\nAs with all pioneer programs, this program is offered depending on demand. If you are interested in joining a future cohort, please keep an eye on our Marlowe Pioneer Program page, where we will announce new course dates.\nTo get started with Marlowe, we invite you to follow the recorded lectures from the latest cohort of this program by following this link.\nIf you want to power up your financial smart contracts with Haskell, you are encouraged to take the first fifteen lectures of our Haskell course in GitHub or in our e-learning platform.\nAt the IOG Education team we are willing to collaborate with companies, governments, universities, and any group of people interested in developing smart contracts for Cardano.\nOne way of collaborating with us is by organizing a hackathon around the Cardano ecosystem. To do so, you are invited to review our hackathon starter kit.\nIf you are interested in hosting any of our courses or any kind of joint educational effort that involves the technology or products that we develop at IOG, please reach out to the IOG Education team via this email education@iohk.io.\nStay tuned in our social media channels for future cohorts of our Pioneer Programs and new in person Haskell courses during 2023.\nWe invite you to subscribe to our IOG Academy YouTube channel and also to follow IOG on our social media channels.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "completion": "During the Astarter Ambassador Community Call series (AACC) in March 2022, we embarked on an exploration of ISPOs on Cardano and have since followed through, developing a plan to deliver a two-stage ISPO and Merge Staking Protocol.\nWe launched the first stage ISPO component (Launchpool) at the end of September 2022 (Epoch 366), enabling staking $ADA to Astarter AA1 stake pool to earn an assignment of $AA tokens.\nAA1 stake pool quickly grew and produced the first three blocks in early October 2022 (Epoch 368). Soon after we announced the block genesis $ADA reward share because success is better when shared.\nLaunchpool has become an integral part of Astarter core product suite for enabling projects launching through Astarter to benefit from our research and development in this area.\nWe identified the potential for Merge Staking multi-token rewards when we first introduced Astarter ISPO and Merge Staking Protocol in May 2022 and introduced a Framework for Merge Staking Rewards Nov 2022. We look forward to delivering the first multi-token baskets as we transition to Merge Staking.\nDuring the Transition to Merge Staking AA1 stake pool is increasing rewards with an incentive consisting of three incremental tiers to take us into the launch of the Merge Staking Protocol.\nTRI 25, AA1 stake pool ISPO base reward increases by 25 and pool $ADA rewards of 25\nTRI 50, AA1 stake pool ISPO base reward increases by 50 and pool $ADA rewards of 50\nTRI 75, AA1 stake pool ISPO base rewards increases by 75 and pool $ADA rewards of 75\nYou are probably wondering about the duration and when each tier begins and ends, however unlike stage 1 there is no set duration as the transition coincides closely with Astarter product launches. Methods of staking AA are required for Merge Staking as well as the Token Generation Event. Margin changes are on-chain and we will announce when a change is made and becomes active.\nThere is a final snapshot for stage 1 scheduled. Snapshots are used for tallying stage 1 bonus rewards and there will be another duration bonus, during the Transition Phase into MSP which will be announced soon for loyal Astartees to enjoy.\nTo earn AA and ADA during the transition phase simply stake Cardano ADA to AA1 stake pool and watch the rewards pile up!\nIn summary, the Transition to Merge Staking is an opportunity for ADA holders to earn AA and ADA from staking to AA1 stake pool. TRI is incremental to margin pool decreases giving delegators higher rewards at each tier and duration bonuses will also be applied in the future.\nAs a final note, there are 3 easy steps to transition into Merge Staking\nStake Cardano ADA to AA1 stake pool\nGet AA + ADA rewards\nStake AA to Astarter DeFi and leverage on Merge Staking Rewards.\nThank you for reading and happy staking.\nAstarter Social Links\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Medium | Youtube\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Cardano 101 Selfcustodial Staking and Why it is Important?",
    "completion": "Cryptocurrency custody is a common discussion topic among those in crypto and blockchain communities.\nFor instance, there is a self-custodial crypto wallet in which the user retains full control over their cryptocurrencies and their private key at all times.\nThere is also a non-custodial or third-party custodial wallet in which a third party retains control and manages the cryptocurrencies on the user s behalf. This requires that the user places their trust in the third party to manage the cryptocurrencies in good faith. A cryptocurrency exchange wallet is a good example of this type of non-custodial wallet.\nThis interest in self-custody has extended to not only crypto wallets but all aspects of decentralized blockchain technology.\nCompared to other proof-of-stake blockchains, Cardano possesses unique technical design features that enable simple self-custody of Cardano ada and Cardano native tokens even while staking to earn rewards.\nCardano ada holders can always retain full control over their stake and withdraw their stake at any time if they use a self-custodial wallet.\nThe Cardano blockchain uses a unique staking mechanism based on Game Theory rather than slashing.\nThe complete outline of how it works can be found in the Ouroboros whitepaper, but it s been proven to work and tested on various conditions. Ouroboros is the name of the proof-of-stake protocol that secures Cardano s decentralized blockchain.\nThe implications of Cardano s design choice are:\nFirst, staking in Cardano is liquid and does not lock a user s ada (native cryptocurrency of Cardano) for any vesting period.\nSecond, delegating one s ada does not transfer ownership of them to the stake pool operator.\nThe custody of the ada cryptocurrency delegated to a Cardano stake pool is always under the control of the private key of the owner. For this reason, delegation for Cardano ada staking purposes poses no loss of ownership risk to the owner of the ada.\nCardano ada holders can easily download and use self-custodial wallets such as Yoroi to stake ada directly from their wallet on both mobile and desktop browser versions while retaining full control over their ada.\nMore: How to stake Cardano ada using Yoroi Wallet\nThis low-risk approach has created a funding mechanism unique to the Cardano blockchain, the Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO).\nIn an ISPO, ada holders delegate to a Cardano staking pool from a specific project building on Cardano, the project keeps a varying percentage of the staking rewards to fund its project development, and the delegators receive the project s token.\nThe delegators know that their ada can never be taken, and they accept the risk of losing their ada rewards in exchange for the project s tokens.\nThis can help fund in part new Cardano projects, plus it attracts a lot of new users to projects that engage in an ISPO.\nAnother feature of self-custodial staking is hardware wallet delegation.\nAll major wallet manufacturers in the blockchain industry support hardware wallet delegation for Cardano ada.\nThis means users can hold ada in their hardware device, and still get the benefits and rewards from delegation and staking.\nThis increases security as the private key of a hardware wallet is offline and the user further protects the cryptocurrencies in their wallet. The Cardano blockchain network still calculates the rewards based on the amount of ada delegated from the wallet.\nMore: How to connect Yoroi to Ledger Wallet\nOnce the rewards have accumulated, the owner can withdraw them and send them directly to the hardware wallet. The added layer of security ensures the ada is protected from potential attackers, and the user doesn t need to sacrifice the staking rewards of the Cardano blockchain network.\nThis careful approach to Proof-of-Stake has resulted in a much more robust and secure consensus mechanism for the Cardano blockchain. At the same time, the design choices have also made it a better user experience for ada users looking to accumulate rewards while securing the Cardano blockchain network.\nYoroi is an open-source and the first crypto light wallet for Cardano ada holders. It allows Cardano ada holders to store, send, receive, and stake Cardano ada for rewards and to secure Cardano s decentralized blockchain.\nAvailable for mobile and desktop browsers, Yoroi is designed to be your gateway to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of DApps including Cardano DeFi, Cardano NFTs, and the USDA stablecoin.\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nYoroi Twitter: @YoroiWallet\nOfficial Website: yoroi-wallet.com\nAbout EMURGO\nOfficial Homepage: emurgo.io\nTwitter (Global): @EMURGO_io\nYouTube: EMURGO channel\nDiscord: EMURGO Community\nFacebook: @EMURGO.io\nInstagram: @EMURGO_io\nLinkedIn: @EMURGO_io\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Bridges and Sidechains Wanchain Making Cardano Interoperable?",
    "completion": "Several months ago, a team from Wanchain reached out to Input Output Global, Inc. ( IOG ) to discuss how to enable interoperability between the Cardano mainnet, Cardano sidechains, and other heterogeneous blockchain networks.\nThe goal? To build the infrastructure required to enable true RealFi applications spanning multiple blockchains to drive the adoption of Cardano s ecosystem, Wanchain s network-agnostic blockchain interoperability solutions, and support the future of Web3.\nIt soon became apparent that this was a monumental task requiring the input (and output!) of multiple teams. Indeed, connecting Cardano to heterogenous blockchains would be a complex undertaking, since Cardano is fundamentally different to most other blockchain networks. Of note, Cardano uses:\nDifferent smart contract environments and programming languages: Cardano uses Plutus and Haskell, not EVM and Solidity;\nDifferent transaction models: Cardano uses a UTXO model (like Bitcoin), not an account-based model (like Ethereum);\nDifferent signature schemes and elliptic curves: Cardano supports EdDSA and Curve25519, not Shnorr and Secp256k1.\nEach of these differences are worthy of their own dedicated post, but suffice to say that, combined, they presented a unique obstacle limiting Cardano s potential for interoperability.\nLuckily, engineers love a good challenge!\nTeams from IOG, Wanchain and MLabs (an industry-best Haskell, Rust, blockchain, and AI consultancy) collaborated to design an actionable plan to make Cardano interoperable and now, with the foundation of an interoperability solution for Cardano in place, the time is right to share some details about what has thus far been an exciting endeavor.\nIn this article, we explain the basic infrastructure for connecting Cardano to heterogeneous blockchain networks, reveal a novel sidechain solution, and share this project s near and long-term roadmap.\nFirst, a bit about Wanchain. Wanchain is both a sustainable layer 1 PoS blockchain and a decentralized blockchain interoperability solution. The Wanchain layer 1 PoS blockchain is a full Ethereum-like environment that works with industry standard Ethereum tools, DApps and protocols. Importantly, it has some ties to Cardano. Wanchain uses Galaxy Consensus, a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that leverages a variety of cryptographic schemes, including distributed secret sharing and threshold signatures, to improve random number generation and block production mechanisms. Galaxy Consensus, developed by world-class researchers and academics, is a continuation of Cardano s own Ouroboros.\nMeanwhile, Wanchain bridges are decentralized, direct, non-custodial bridges that connect both EVM and non-EVM networks without requiring any relay chains or intermediary networks. These bridges use a combination of Secure Multiparty Computation (sMPC) and Shamir's Secret Sharing to secure crosschain assets. Currently, more than 15 layer 1 and layer 2 networks (and counting!) are connected by Wanchain s wide area network of blockchains.\nThe first element needed to build Cardano s crosschain interoperability solution is decentralized, non-custodial, bi-directional crosschain bridges connecting Cardano to other layer 1 blockchains.\nA crosschain bridge transfers assets and/or data from a source chain to a target chain. In its most basic form, this is usually done by locking an asset on the source chain and minting a wrapped asset of the same value on the target chain. We call this the Lock-Mint-Burn-Unlock method. For the Lock-Mint-Burn-Unlock method to work, three main smart contracts are deployed: one on source chain to handle source assets, one on target chain to handle target assets, and one on a managing chain to handle registration and staking of bridge nodes.\nFor those unfamiliar, Figure 1, below, illustrates a source chain to target chain transaction. A brief description: when the crosschain transaction is initiated by a user, the target chain and target address are specified. The source chain smart contract locks the source token and emits a Lock event. The bridge nodes detect the Lock event and instruct the target chain smart contract to mint a token of the same value on the target chain.\nFigure 1. A basic crosschain transaction\nTo bring the token back to the source chain, the owner of the token simply sends a redeem transaction to the target chain smart contract. The target chain smart contract burns the wrapped token and sends out a Burn event. The bridge nodes detect the Burn event and instruct the source chain smart contract to unlock the token on the source chain. Wanchain bridge nodes are permissionless and use multiparty computation and staking to prevent collusion.\nAs mentioned above, Cardano has several fundamental differences that complicate the task of deploying crosschain bridges. Here is how IOG, Wanchain, and MLabs have tackled these issues:\nDifferent virtual machines and programming languages: Cardano uses Plutus and Haskell, not EVM and Solidity\nWanchain s expertise is in connecting fully heterogeneous blockchains. The current crosschain infrastructure already includes blockchains that use EVM (like Ethereum and Wanchain), WebAssembly (like Polkadot), and even blockchains that have no virtual machines at all (like Bitcoin, XRP Ledger, and Litecoin). When possible, we solve this issue by developing native smart contracts on both the source and target chains. Otherwise, if a network does not support smart contracts, Wanchain bridge nodes jointly manage a dedicated lock account using sMPC. Wanchain s ever-changing selection of permissionless bridge nodes then communicate with smart contracts (or lock accounts) on each chain, as needed.\nDifferent transaction models: Cardano uses a UTXO model (ike Bitcoin), not an account-based model (like Ethereum)\nWanchain bridge nodes have adaptors to connect to different blockchains. The adaptors can construct transactions based on the transactional model of the intended blockchain. An API specification provided by IOG enables Wanchain to define the format of transactions to call smart contracts on Cardano.\nDifferent signature schemes and elliptic curves: Cardano supports EdDSA and Curve25519, not Shnorr and Secp256k1\nThis proved to be the biggest dependency for Cardano s interoperability solution. Cardano originally supported EdDSA and Curve25519, not Schnorr and Secp256k1. Following a request from Wanchain and MLabs, Input Output coordinated internal efforts to add native support to Cardano for a Schnorr signature and Secp256k1 curve. Both will be publicly available following Cardano s Vasil hard fork.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently commented that he was pessimistic about crosschain applications due to the fundamental security limitations of bridges. Though we at Wanchain disagree with his conclusions, his concerns are valid. As such, special consideration is being taken to secure the crosschain bridges and maximize the security of Cardano s interoperability solution.\nThis leads to the second element needed to build Cardano s crosschain interoperability solution: Wanchain bridge nodes will be upgraded to peg the Wanchain and Cardano networks to further secure Cardano s crosschain bridges and transactions. In simpler terms, Wanchain will serve as an EVM-compatible sidechain to Cardano.\nThe Cardano-Wanchain peg is based on a two-phase Merkle transaction verification. This proof mechanism includes the following components:\nA state management contract deployed on Cardano;\nBridges nodes are responsible for authenticating the validity of Wanchain blockchain data, calculate Merkle roots, and save the Merkle root value to Cardano at regular intervals;\nA two-stage Merkle tree proof.\nA two-stage Merkle tree proof is used to prove the correctness of a Wanchain transaction using the compressed data stored in Cardano. This two-stage proof has two components, namely, the First Stage Proof (FSP) and the Second Stage Proof (SSP). FSP is used to prove the fact that tx is stored in some Wanchain block with bh as its transaction Merkle root. SSP is used to prove the fact that bh is a valid transaction Merkle root of some block in Wanchain. With a combination of FSP and SSP, we can know for a fact that tx is a valid transaction in Wanchain. This procedure is shown, below, in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Verification path of 2-Stage Proof\nTo prove the correctness of Tx1, the two-stage proof is constructed as follows:\nFSP={Tx1, Tx2,Tx34,LRoot3}\nSSP={LRoot3,LRoot4,LRoot12}\n2StageProof={FSP,SSP}\nThe 2-Stage Proof is valid if the following equations hold:\nLRoot3=SHA256(SHA256Tx1,Tx2,Tx34);\nRoot=SHA256(LRoot12,SHA256LRoot3,LRoot4);\nNot only does this novel approach maximize the security of Cardano s interoperability solution, it also doubles as a scalability solution. Transactions can now safely be moved off Cardano, recording only the vital information on the layer 1 blockchain to ensure security and immutability.\nEnabling full interoperability between the Cardano mainnet, Cardano sidechains, and other heterogeneous blockchain networks is a long term project. As such, this project will be defined by incremental improvements, rather than radical leaps.\nThe first basic Cardano-Wanchain bridge has been live in a test environment for several months, allowing wrapped ada to be minted on Wanchain. Following Cardano s Vasil hard fork, these bridges will be deployed to the mainnet.\nFigure 3. Wrapped ADA in a test environment\nMeanwhile, work will continue to make Wanchain a formal EVM-compatible sidechain to Cardano. Once the two-phase Merkle transaction verification is in place, Wanchain will be positioned as a scalability solution for applications currently running on Cardano.\nOver time, the full Cardano-Wanchain interoperability topology will take shape, as seen in figure 4 below.\nFigure 4. The Cardano-Wanchain interoperability topology\nThe topology s bottom layer is formed by layer 1 blockchains such as Cardano, Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, or Bitcoin. These are all connected by existing Wanchain crosschain bridges. The vertical connections bridge layer 1 to layer 2 networks and sidechains such as Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimistic. The layer 2/sidechain layer is ideal to host tokens and RealFi projects. Assets crossing bridges in this layer do not need to pass through the layer 1 network to reach their target destination. Wanchain has already deployed several of these layer 1, layer 2 and sidechain-to-sidechain bridges.\nAs Cardano s own sidechain strategy continues to mature, the interoperability solution that we are building today will be able to service Cardano s crosschain and sidechain needs.\nWanchain, the Wide Area Network chain, is a decentralized blockchain interoperability solution with a mission to drive blockchain adoption through interoperability by building fully decentralized, non-custodial bridges that connect the world s many siloed blockchain networks. Wanchain empowers developers to build truly decentralized crosschain applications to power the future of Web3.\nWebsite | Bridge | Documentation | Telegram| Twitter | Newsletter | Blockchain Explorer | Developer Portal\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article is for general guidance on matters of interest only.

Some of the first leaders of newly independent African nations studied at LSE and its progressive and anti-imperialist stance saw the school play a part in the anti-apartheid movement.\nThere was a powerful case for blockchain in Africa, he argued. Blockchain technology has great potential to unlock the wealth of countries through the tokenisation of natural resources, labour or property. Tokens aren t just good for CryptoKitties, it turns out you can do real things with these platforms, so let s go try that.\nIf you count the locked up liquidity in these countries it s in the trillions of dollars. It s a great paradox that there s tremendous potential value in places and if only it could be accessed and given to the people in some fair way then poverty would melt away and these would become some of the wealthiest countries.\nSo that s what Cardano is doing for the developing world, said Charles. We have a moral obligation to try and explore this tech and get it to as many people as possible.\nThe talk was followed by a wide-ranging question and answer session, with questions on everything from the future of blockchain in China, to transaction fees on Cardano, to establishing regulated cryptocurrency businesses.\nThe audience had a mix of backgrounds, from serious Cardano fans who had watched hours of videos online, to the cryptocurrency curious.\nTimo, 27, is a student from Salzburg at Regent s Business School in London. Having been interested in cryptocurrency for more than a year, he says he d watched Charles s Ted talk, seen his interviews and then bought Ada.

    "prompt": "How Cardanos transaction fees work?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nLars Br njes - Education Director\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: October 19, 2017\nSummary:\nThe mathematician working on the protocol's incentives explains the research and IOHK's design\nArticle:\nThere are two main reasons why transaction fees are needed for a cryptocurrency like Cardano:\nPeople who run full Cardano nodes spend time, money, and effort to run the protocol, for which they should be compensated and rewarded. In contrast to Bitcoin, where new currency is created with each mined block, in Cardano, transaction fees are the only source of income for participants in the protocol.\nThe second reason for transaction fees is the prevention of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. In a DDoS attack, an attacker tries to flood the network with dummy transactions, and if he has to pay a sufficiently high fee for each of those dummy transactions, this form of attack will become prohibitively expensive for him.\nWhenever somebody wants to transfer an amount of Ada, some minimal fees are computed for that transaction. For the transaction to be valid, these minimal fees have to be included (although the sender is free to pay higher fees if he so wishes). All transaction fees are collected in a virtual pool and then later distributed amongst participants in the Cardano protocol.\nThe minimal fees for a transaction are calculated according to the formula\na + b × size,\na + b × size,\nwhere 'a' and 'b' are constants and 'size' is the size of the transaction in Bytes. At the moment, the constants 'a' and 'b' have the values\na = 0.155381 ADA, b = 0.000043946 ADA/Byte.\na = 0.155381 ADA, b = 0.000043946 ADA/Byte.\nThis means that each transaction costs at least 0.155381 ADA, with an additional cost of 0.000043946 ADA per Byte of transaction size. For example, a transaction of size 200 Byte (a fairly typical size) costs\n0.155381 ADA + 0.000043946 ADA/Byte × 200 Byte = 0.1641702 ADA.\n0.155381 ADA + 0.000043946 ADA/Byte × 200 Byte = 0.1641702 ADA.\nWhy did we pick this particular formula? The reason for having parameter 'a' is the prevention of DDoS attacks mentioned above: even a very small dummy transaction should cost enough to hurt an attacker who tries to generate many thousands of them. Parameter 'b' has been introduced to reflect actual costs: storing larger transactions needs more computer memory than storing smaller transactions, so larger transactions should be more expensive than smaller ones.\nTo arrive at the particular values for parameters 'a' and 'b', we had to answer questions like:\nHow expensive is one byte of computer memory?\nHow many transactions will there be on average per second?\nHow large will a transaction be on average?\nHow much does it cost to run a full node?\nWe had to estimate the answers to those questions, but now that Cardano is up and running, we will be able to gather statistics to find more accurate answers. This means that 'a' and 'b' will probably be adjusted in the future to better reflect actual costs.\nWe even plan to eventually come up with a scheme that will adjust those constants dynamically in a market-driven way, so that no human intervention will be needed to react to changes in traffic and operational costs. How to achieve this is one focus of our active research.\nAll transaction fees of a given \"epoch\" are collected in a virtual pool, and the idea is to then redistribute the money from that pool amongst people who were elected \"slot leaders\" by the proof of stake algorithm during that epoch and who created blocks.\nAt this stage of Cardano, where all blocks are created by nodes operated by IOHK and our partners, fees are already collected (to prevent DDoS attacks), but they will not be distributed and instead will be burnt.\nAs soon as Cardano enters its next, fully decentralized stage, fees will be distributed as described above.\nComing up with a solid scheme for fee distribution is a challenging mathematical problem: How do we incentivize \"good\" behavior and promote efficiency while punishing \"bad\" behavior and attacks? How do we make sure that people who participate in the protocol receive their fair reward, while also ensuring that the best way to earn money with Cardano is to make the system as reliable and efficient as possible? The trick is to align incentives for node operators with the \"common good\" so that rewards are highest when the system is running at optimal performance.\nThese are questions studied by the mathematical discipline called Game Theory, and we are proud to have prominent game theorists and G del Award laureate Prof. Elias Koutsoupias of the University of Oxford working with us on finding solutions to this problem.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Mithril a stronger and lighter blockchain for better efficiency?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nOlga Hryniuk - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: October 29, 2021\nSummary:\nA new IOHK-developed protocol acts as a stake-based threshold signature scheme allowing for transparent, secure, and lightweight stake leveraging\nArticle:\nAt the Cardano Summit 2021, IOHK researchers Pyrros Chaidos and Roman Oliynykov presented the design and goals of Mithril new research and engineering effort carried out by IOHK. Mithril will provide a stake-based threshold signature scheme that can be implemented as the protocol to solve chain synchronization, state bootstrapping, and trust issues in blockchain applications.\nMithril is the name used for a fictional metal in Middle-Earth a malleable material, very light in weight but strong as 'triple steel', which does not tarnish or dim. Thus, the name symbolizes strength in terms of security and a lightweight approach with regard to the developed protocol.\nLet s start with some background information to understand Mithril's benefits for the development of blockchain solutions.\nCardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain, so the consensus algorithm randomly selects nodes to become block producers according to the stake they hold. For certain messages or actions, it is important that a particular number of stakeholders provide their cryptographic signatures. The consensus protocol determines how individual nodes assess the current state of the ledger system and has three main responsibilities:\nperform a leader check and decide if a block should be produced\nhandle chain selection\nverify produced blocks.\nTo achieve greater scalability in a blockchain setting, it is essential to address the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of participants. This means that the higher the number of participants (which are assumed to be numerous), the more complex it becomes to efficiently aggregate their signatures. In a base scenario, to presume a signature that talks for the majority of stakeholders, every stakeholder needs to sign the appropriate individual message. Although this is possible, it is inefficient in terms of scalability and speed.\nGiven the time it takes to validate a particular message, and the resource usage during chain synchronization, it is vital to provide a solution that makes multi-signature aggregation fast and efficient without compromising security features.\nMithril is a protocol designed to:\nleverage stake to obtain higher efficiency\nensure transparent setup while not requiring increased trust settings\nleverage trade-offs between size and efficiency, which is guaranteed by the modular component design.\nMithril works in a public setting where signers don t need to interact with other signers to produce a valid signature. The aggregator combines all the signatures into one, and this process is logarithmic with respect to the number of signatures, which results in a sublinear performance for Mithril aggregation. For example, when applied to full node clients like Daedalus, Mithril can boost full node data synchronization ensuring speed and decreasing resource consumption.\nTo represent a significant fraction of the total stake, Mithril uses the stake-based threshold setting. This behavior is different from the standard setting in which the given number of participants is required to validate a particular message. In the stake-based threshold setting, the protocol requires a fraction of the total stake to validate a given message to generate a correct signature.\nMithril also certifies consensus in a trustless setting. This means that it does not include any additional trust assumptions. It is possible to achieve consensus certification without including any additional assumptions, other than those already present in the proof of stake. For example, it can work within wallet-as-a-service, and the mobile client will use the certificate obtained from a Mithril node. With advanced security settings, such a procedure is potentially more efficient than SPO blockchain verification.\nFinally, to ensure fast chain state bootstrapping, the signature scheme allows different stakeholders to validate only a given checkpoint of the chain. Stakeholders need not go through the whole transaction history of the given state they simply need to go through the checkpoints to verify that the final stake is valid. This is beneficial for light client applications like light wallets that need to work fast without a full chain synchronization. Mithril signatures can be also useful for lightweight tally verification, or cryptocurrency governance decision making.\nMithril enables a multi-party signature by holding a number of individual lotteries (M) and considering a message to be valid if it has been signed by a number of different winners (K) over those lotteries. Each user, therefore, attempts to sign the message and then passes its signature through what is considered a lottery function. This function allows individual users to check if their signatures are eligible as lottery winners and output those without waiting. This is different from a standard setting, where slot leaders need to wait until their slot is active to participate. Once there are case signatures over different lotteries, they can be aggregated into a single Mithril signature.\nThe design of Mithril involves three phases:\nFigure 1. Phases of Mithril operation\nTo set up a Mithril protocol, users need to:\nfix the group setting where the cryptography will take place\nselect the index range M, which is the number of elections they will be holding\nset the quorum size K, which is the number of election winners that need to sign a signature for it to be accepted.\nIt is also important to provide a reference string for the proof system. This is possible in a transparent manner and does not require any high trust assumptions.\nDuring this phase, users should update the state distribution. This lets every stakeholder know from what stake they are holding. Then, each stakeholder is responsible for registering their keys. This can happen either on or off the chain.\nFinally, users need to distribute stake and compress their test keys, which is done using the Merkle tree. This function allows Mithril signatures to be verified against a single hash that represents that Merkle tree. So, the size of the state needed to verify a signature can be kept low.\nWhile working with the chain, users can produce, aggregate, and verify Mithril signatures. Producing signatures involves users attempts to check if the signature they produced is actually a winner on one of the lotteries held in parallel. If true, the users will broadcast their signatures. If there are enough signatures supporting a particular message over different lotteries, they can be aggregated into a single Mithril signature. It can then be broadcast and verified by anyone using only the reference string for the proof system and the very short Merkle tree hash of stake distribution.\nFor example, a single user can create a signature with Mithril as follows:\nFigure 2. Mithril signature creation\nFirst, a user will check the amount of stake they hold and pass it through a score function to obtain their score threshold T. Then, they will attempt to produce a candidate signature S. For each index, they will evaluate whether the candidate's signature they produced paired with the message they have just signed. The index number of the lottery they're checking against should also produce a score value that is less than their threshold T. If that is true, then the candidate signature they produced has actually won the lottery on that particular index number. If not, they will make the next attempt.\nAfter trying all possible indexes, users will potentially have one or more indexes for which their signature S is valid. For each of those indexes, they can output an individual signature consisting of their candidate signature, the index number for which it is valid, and the proof that verifies that their score is consistent with the registered stake.\nImplementing Mithril on Cardano, we can represent the software interaction as follows:\nFigure 3. Mithril network architecture\nA high-level representation of software around a stake pool operator (SPO) includes its connection to the Cardano peer-to-peer (P2P) network, the Mithril node s P2P network, and the Mithril client connected to the node run by an SPO.\nThe Mithril node at the SPO platform accesses its verified blockchain at the local storage and runs the protocol to produce Mithril certificates that are kept at the Mithril storage. Produced Mithril certificates can be verifiably synchronized across the whole network. Thus, the SPO can share both the full Cardano blockchain and the list of valid Mithril certificates for it. When the Mithril client connects to the network, it requests a list of Mithril certificates and asks only for the longest chain of the Cardano blockchain.\nSeveral SPOs can also participate in such a setting. The Mithril client will then verify that certificates fully confirm the obtained Cardano blockchain. The whole procedure is lightweight and will not require the involvement of significant network storage or computational resources. Moreover, Cardano full node sync and fast sync with Mithril procedures are not mutually exclusive they can be run in parallel. Mithril fast sync will be later confirmed by the full node sync.\nLet s take a look at the use cases where Mithril applicability is highly beneficial.\nMithril boosts the efficiency of full node clients or applications such as Daedalus. It ensures fast and secure synchronization of the full node data, significantly improving time and required resources including computation, network exchange, and local storage while keeping high-level security guarantees.\nMithril is also applicable to light clients and mobile applications, ensuring a trustless approach. Another significant advantage is using Mithril signatures for running sidechains. The main blockchain can connect to different sidechains that can even have different consensus protocols. Mithril has benefits in lightweight blockchain state verification, and thus, certificates can validate the current state of the specific blockchain as well as the correctness of forward and backward transfers in a secure way.\nFinally, stake-based voting applications and governance solutions can use Mithril regardless of the voting protocol s complexity. Mithril signatures can be utilized for secure and lightweight tally verification. This is also useful in governance when stakeholders go through a decentralized decision-making process and provide the final result in an easy and verifiable way.\nSeveral companies are already interested in Mithril implementation within their blockchain solutions. Galois, an advanced R&D firm focused on formal methods, cryptography, and hardware, will be implementing the first Mithril prototype based on the research done by IOHK. Galois will be implementing Mithril in the Rust programming language due to its fast prototyping features. They plan first to present smaller signatures with BulletProofs, then followed by production-ready implementations, and finally formal proofs of correctness.\nIdyllic Vision is another company focused on building a self-sovereign identity protocol based on zero-knowledge proofs, a credential management system for organizations, and a mobile wallet for end-users that supports interoperability between diverse society solutions. They are planning to implement the proof of concept of the Mithril node. In the following months, they will begin with creating a blueprint of solution architecture, defining a number of system components that should be developed and organically integrated into the existing infrastructure. This includes integration with the Mithril crypto library and the Cardano node, and a networking layer for communication between nodes. The result of this phase should be integrated into Cardano to enable fast bootstrapping of the node and support for extra functionality like lightweight clients as others.\nTo find out more, read the Mithril research paper.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

This is accomplished by presenting the new transaction to older clients as a \"pay-to-anybody\" transaction (in a special form) and convincing miners to consent to refuse blocks containing these transactions until the transaction verifies under the proposed regulations.

Hydra researchers also updated security proofs of the Coordinated Hydra Head protocol, which are bound to be included in the Hydra Head V1 specification.\nThe Mithril team released a new 2248.1 distribution. They published the first version of the Mithril cryptographic library on crates.io the Rust community s crate registry. The team also completed editing the first draft version of the Mithril decentralized network CIP, which is currently being reviewed by the Cardano network team.\nFinally, they started simplifying the aggregator node's multi-signer by removing the certificate creation from its responsibilities.\nThis week Project Catalyst is holding elections for the Circle V4, which will remain open until December 16th (23:45 UTC). Please take a look here to learn more about what the Circle is and how to cast your vote. As we draw 2022 to a close, we recap a little on what's to come for Project Catalyst in 2023.\nWhat started as an experiment in grassroots innovation has evolved into a community-led organism. The Cardano community continues to be the heart of Project Catalyst, expressing their views, steering from the helm, and influencing the overall direction.\nFor 2023, the community is facing some critical decisions on how they would like to see the funding mechanism and governance structure work. Specifically, how that structure should function given the required transparency throughout the entire funding process and how the funding mechanism becomes entirely self-sustaining within the ecosystem.\nSome of this work has already started. For example, IOG and representatives from the Catalyst community hosted a workshop at the Cardano Foundation Summit to discuss how to make Catalyst more inclusive. The attendees recognized the need for a charter empowering the community to self-determine the next era of Project Catalyst. Having a Project Catalyst charter could be the bedrock for engagement and how each community member participates in the overall governance of Project Catalyst.\nAdditionally, Project Catalyst and Cardano are heading into the age of Voltaire, and much of the technical aspects of how Cardano will be governed on the chain are available to read in CIP-1694. With the release of the Voltaire CIP and all the announcements at IO ScotFest, next year promises to be full of evolution - with Project Catalyst playing a significant role in the innovation and growth of Cardano.\nDB Sync 13.1.0.0-rc2 DB Sync 3 DB Sync\nDaedalus CPU/RAM Byron cardano-app Ledger Trezor Cicero DevX\nDApp Lace UI Lace\nAdrestia cardano-js-sdk cardano-wallet build-balance balanceTx\nCI/CD v.1.35.4 cardano-wallet\nPlutus Plutus Debugger MVP Marconi cardano-api\nMarlowe Marlowe Runtime Marlowe Playground Nix Flakes Playground PK Address Marlowe REST API GET/contracts/:contractId/withdrawals PUT/contracts/:contractId/transactions/:transactionId GET/contracts/:contractId/transactions/:transactionId\nmarlowe-tx marlowe ls ACTUS PureScript\nHydra MBT hydra-node AcquirePointTooOld Hydra Coordinated Hydra Head Hydra Head V1\nMithril 2248.1 Mithril Rust crates.io Mithril decentralized network CIP Cardano\nProject Catalyst Circle V4 12 17 8:45 Circle 2022 2023 Project Catalyst\nCardano Project Catalyst\n2023\nIOG Catalyst Cardano Catalyst Project Catalyst Project Catalyst Project Catalyst\nProject Catalyst Cardano Voltaire Cardano CIP-1694 Voltaire CIP IO ScotFest Project Catalyst Cardano\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "completion": "Over the past couple of weeks, the networking team worked on the stake-driven data diffusion release for relays with robust and optimized peer selection, also known as P2P. It has been determined that the earlier communicated performance regression affects block producers only, so running this release on such nodes is not recommended. Further investigation is required to find the cause of this regression. On IOG's benchmarking cluster, the team has seen good performance improvements in block propagation. The cluster is running a static topology with valency 6 (each node is connected to 6 other nodes), where each of the 50 nodes is a block producer. The setup of this network is the same as on mainnet. Overall, there is a 40-50 performance improvement in block propagation compared to the same cluster deployed with the same topology with non-P2P nodes.\nFinally, the team worked on several bug fixes, reviewed peer-sharing functionality, and held a guest lecture on Avoiding System Catastrophes at UCLouvain.\nThe consensus team merged improvements to the monadic cursor API needed to implement LMDB range reads, which is in turn required for implementing the UTXO HD feature. They added tables to several tests in the UTXO HD feature, increasing confidence in the correctness of the prototype. The mempool property tests are close to being completed, and the team also finished the LSM tree-tuning algorithm.\nWork is ongoing on the Genesis design. The team started simplifying the BlockFetch logic taking into account CSJ-specific workloads.\nFinally, they documented the block diffusion pipelining feature, and added a high-level overview of consensus to the top level documentation of ouroboros-network.\nAs always, see this technical development report for more details from different teams.\nThis week, the Daedalus team continued working on the Cicero migration.\nWork is ongoing on the Lace desktop development. The team successfully tested transaction submission via a local node and progressed on the start and stop feature in the settings page of the cardano-node. Additionally, they ran Wingsrider-DApp in the Lace desktop application connecting to the internal wallet and successfully performing a swap transaction.\nThe Adrestia team released cardano-rosetta v.2.0.0-beta.1. This release bumps cardano-serialization-lib to v.11.1.1.\nThe team continues working on getting cardano-js-sdk ready for production, and also on implementing the multisig (shared wallets) feature, and the first implementation of the build-balance library (balanceTx) in cardano-wallet.\nFinally, they're working on updating cardano-wallet to support node 1.35.4.\nThis week, the Plutus team worked on the completion of SECP-256k1 builtin for Plutus, script capacity increase, and the Plutus debugger MVP. The tools team created a release for plutus-apps that supports all Babbage features. They are now continuing building indexers with Marconi and are also working on technical debt by supporting cardano-api in the emulator.\nThe Marlowe team worked on endpoints for the REST API. Particularly, they created: POST /contracts for building an unsigned contract creation transaction; GET /contracts/:contractId for getting contract state; PUT /contracts/:contractId for submitting a signed creation transaction for a contract; GET /contracts/:contractId/transactions for obtaining the transaction history for a contract; and POST /contracts/:contractId/transactions for creating an unsigned transaction to interact with a contract.\nThe team also added a unit property-based test for solveInitialTxBodyContent, kind annotation to protocol tags, and tests for marlowe-protocol messages serialization.\nLast week, the Hydra team attended the Cardano Summit in Lausanne, where Sebastian Nagel, technical manager of Hydra at IOG, gave a presentation about Hydra, and the whole team connected with the Cardano community. After the public event, the team also conducted a workshop, which provided room for a retrospective and various planning sessions discussed collaboratively on different ideas.\nThe Mithril team worked on finalizing the release process by adding new features: publishing their cryptographic library to the Rust community, adding node versions manifest in the release notes, and signing the binaries embedded in the distributions. They also deprecated the declarative signer node registration that will be decommissioned in a few weeks, and completed the automatic store upgrade process for the signer and aggregator nodes.\nFinally, the team continued working on the redaction of the CIP that will allow the decentralization of Mithril by using the Cardano node networking layer.\nThis week Project Catalyst s Town Halls restarted. Over 100 attendees joined directly to hear the latest from the team, participate in conversations about the Voltaire CIP-1694 and discuss ideas for improving proposal assessment.\nWith 2023 on the horizon, the complexity of Project Catalyst, and the importance of the funds it distributes, much consideration is needed on how processes should work to support future growth. It doesn t make sense to attempt to rebuild the ship as it sails. Given the above, and ahead of the next funding cycle, some time is needed to streamline some of the Catalyst processes and procedures to ensure Catalyst's stable and continued growth within the Cardano ecosystem. This means Fund9 accounts for the last fund of 2022, with Fund10 expected to launch around Q1 2023.\nThat being said, the conversations never stop.

They upgraded the Mithril test networks infrastructure to make them more resilient and kept on refining the release process fixing some minor bugs. The team also worked on the second phase of implementing the automatic store upgrade of the signer and aggregator nodes.\nFinally, they continued working on the CIP design that proposes connecting the Mithril network to the Cardano network layer so that the latter will handle the main networking capabilities.\nProject Catalyst and Cardano are heading into the age of Voltaire. CIP-1694 was published last week, laying down the foundations for decentralized decision making. CIP-1694 describes a mechanism for on-chain governance that will underpin the Voltaire phase of Cardano.\nThe document builds on and extends the original Cardano governance scheme that was based on a fixed number of governance keys. It aims to provide a first step that is both valuable and technically achievable in the near term as part of the proposed Voltaire governance system.\nIt also seeks to act as a jumping-off point for continuing community input, including appropriate threshold settings and other on-chain settings. Subsequent proposals may adapt and extend this proposal to meet emerging governance needs.\nIt s now open for public review and contributions here.\nIOG and a snippet of the Project Catalyst community hosted a workshop at last week s Cardano Foundation Summit to help define and shape the future direction of Project Catalyst. This started by identifying a need for a charter that provides a framework to empower the community to self-determine the next era of Project Catalyst. It was one of the most popular workshops across the Summit, with over 50 participants engaging in thought-provoking discussions.

    "completion": "This week, the node, ledger, and consensus teams continued preparing for the Vasil upgrade.\nLast Friday, the team announced that the Vasil hard fork would be triggered on September 22, which means that the Vasil capability will become available at the start of epoch 366 on September 27.\nIn preparation for the hard fork, DApp projects, exchanges, and SPOs continue upgrading their systems to ensure compatibility. Artano, a community-driven non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, recently shared a blog post with its key development takeaways. Artano s testing results show up to 76-77 fee reduction and up to 92 decrease in transaction size.\nFor the Vasil readiness updates, see the Ecosystem readiness tracker.\nThe consensus team also implemented property tests for the UTXO HD backing store API implementations, benchmarked the anti-difference prototype to increase the UTXO HD functionality, and elaborated a draft specification for the Genesis implementation and ChainSync jumping optimization.\nThis week, the Daedalus team fixed several issues found in regression tests and released Daedalus v.5.0.0 for pre-production and preview environments. They also ran additional tests in preparation for the upcoming mainnet release.\nDevelopment work is ongoing on the Lace desktop features. The team worked on the component that enables the switch between cardano-wallet instances (light and full nodes). They also completed the proof of concept to convert the cardano-wallet API into TypeScript types.\nFinally, they completed work on the adapter that enables light-mode communication with the cardano-wallet.\nThe Adrestia team released a performance improvement update for Rosetta. They're also working on getting cardano-production-ready.\nFinally, they continue working on the implementation of multisig (shared wallets) and \"light\" mode features in cardano-wallet.\nThis week, the Plutus team continued working on the support feature for multiple language versions as well as on testing and documentation improvements. They also made progress on the implementation of Babbage support for Plutus tools and library constraints testing.\nFinally, the team is working on Marconi - a new tool for indexing blockchain information in a database for fast querying. They worked on the Marconi design and planned for setting up the Marconi testing infrastructure.\nThe Marlowe team improved property-based testing, removed marlowe-web-commons in favor of purescript-marlowe, and replaced PK with Address in the specification and Isabelle proofs. They also updated all Marlowe repositories to use Flakes and upgraded the Cardano node dependency to v.1.35.\nFinally, they continued working on the exploratory design of the Transaction Creation component in Marlowe.\nThis week, the Hydra team created Hydra tools to improve the user experience of running Hydra nodes. They also completed a significant refactoring of the Direct chain layer, which makes it easier to maintain the node and prepare for adding persistence to the hydra-node.\nFinally, the team created smoke tests to (optionally) re-use already published Hydra scripts and improved the Hydra node log output for easier reading and parsing.\nThe Mithril team has recently released the first Mithril proof of concept. Mithril is a stake-based signature scheme used to improve the speed and efficiency of syncing times for nodes joining the network. If you re interested to get involved, see the Mithril repository, which is now open-source, Mithril proof-of-concept documentation, and join the Discord channel for more discussions.\nThe voting period for Project Catalyst Fund9 is now open!

    "prompt": "Implementing auction projects using Hydra?",
    "completion": "This project is a collaboration between Input Output Global (IOG) and MLabs to develop a reference implementation of an auction that uses Hydra protocols. The purpose of this is twofold:\nThe hope is that this project, and similar projects focusing on other use cases, will blaze the trail for the Cardano community to start using Hydra for scalability in common practice.\nHydra is a family of protocols intended to provide the layer 2 scalability solution for Cardano. The Hydra Head protocol is the first protocol in this family it is a suite of smart contracts and software that allows any group of participants to establish isomorphic, multi-party state channels (Hydra heads) with each other. The Hydra Head protocol will be used in this project.\nHydra heads allow participants to transact with each other, using the funds that they brought into the state channels, without having to submit these transactions to Cardano s main network (layer 1). The final result of these interactions between Hydra head participants can be brought back to Cardano layer 1 by closing the Hydra head, which releases the funds inside the head to be used in other Hydra heads or otherwise on Cardano layer 1.\nTransactions within a head have the same format and properties as transactions on Cardano layer 1 they are isomorphic. In principle, this allows Cardano DApps to re-use a significant portion of their codebase when transitioning some of their smart contracts to use Hydra.\nOne exception to this isomorphism property is that token minting/burning within a Hydra head cannot affect Cardano layer 1. The only thing that a Hydra head can achieve on Cardano layer 1 is the redistribution of existing tokens from the UTXOs committed to the Hydra head to new UTXOs. This is done according to the transactions that participants have consented to inside the head.\nThere are also some differences between the consensus protocols of Cardano layer 1 and Hydra layer 2. This may require existing Cardano DApps to adapt their design so that they can maintain their desired behavior within the Hydra head environment. In particular, unlike Cardano layer 1, the Hydra head participants must all remain online and responsive to each other, during the operation of the Hydra head, and all participants must acknowledge and agree to each transaction within the Hydra head for it to have an effect.\nApplications can be run within a single head, or they can be spread out across a network of Hydra heads. When an application is spread across a network of Hydra heads, its global state can be evolved either through communication between Hydra heads (bypassing layer 1) or by synchronizing local head states to layer 1 and resolving them there.\nThere is an evolving catalog of Hydra head network topologies, each with its benefits and limitations. The catalog is expected to expand as more applications will be built on Hydra. Some of these topologies are used in the Hydra-based auction designs that we discuss below.\nMore information on Hydra is available here.\nIn the discovery phase of this project, a business analysis was conducted to better understand the auction space on Cardano and how it can leverage Hydra scaling technology.\nIOG and MLabs surveyed a broad group of Cardano projects building auctions and NFT marketplaces, from which a smaller group of four projects was selected for in-depth interviews on:\nWe discovered that there is broad agreement among the interviewees that an English-style auction with standard features should be targeted by the reference implementation in this project. All of the interviewees are planning to use such an auction within their respective platforms.\nThe core features of an English-style auction are as follows:\nA seller provides a product to be sold at the auction (the 'auction lot') eg, an NFT.\nWhen the auction starts, bidders can begin placing bids, which must be higher than the starting price defined by the seller.\nThe winning bidder must pay his bid. This can be guaranteed by requiring bid deposits to fully back each bid, or else it can be more weakly enforced by imposing monetary or reputational penalties on bidders that dishonor their bids.\nDuring the auction, each bidder may increase his bid by at least the minimum bid increment defined by the seller.\nAt the end of the auction:\nAdditional useful features may be included in an English-style auction:\nOne of the interviewees is also seeking to implement a Dutch-style auction, in addition to the English-style auction that they will use elsewhere on their platform. In a Dutch-style auction, the auction price starts high and then decrements automatically over time, until a bidder agrees to buy the auction lot at the current price winning the auction. While the smart contracts for a Dutch-style auction are different from those of an English auction, they share most of the Hydra limitations for auctions. Thus, a reference implementation of an English-style auction that properly mitigates the Hydra limitations would be useful for the Dutch-style auction, as well.\nUltimately, the interviewees preference is to prioritize a Hydra-based auction implementation that provides the core English auction features while sufficiently mitigating the limitations of Hydra for the auction use case. The additional features would be nice-to-have, as well, but they could be added on by the projects themselves as they adapt our reference implementation to their own needs. The primary problem that they are hoping we will solve is how to implement a functional English auction with the core features of Hydra.\nIn both the survey questionnaire and the in-depth interviews, respondents were asked about the benefits and limitations of the Hydra Head protocol for their projects. In the in-depth interviews, interviewees were provided a standard briefing on Hydra to ensure that they were properly informed about how the technology works when giving their answers about benefits and limitations.\nSurvey respondents identified the following limitations of running general applications on the Cardano main network:\nThe first three limitations particularly affect the scalability and business viability of auction projects on Cardano:\nInterviewees hope to realize the following benefits from using Hydra in their auction projects:\nThe interviewees identified the following limitations that are currently discouraging them from pursuing a Hydra-based auction implementation on their own.\nFirst, it is unclear how to run zero-sum games within a Hydra head. In the simplified head protocol (currently implemented in the hydra-poc GitHub repository), any head participant at any time can veto the further evolution of the Hydra head. Exercising this veto power leaves other participants no choice but to close the Hydra head to layer 1 with the last head state that all participants managed to agree on before the veto.\nFor an auction run within a single Hydra head, this veto power is particularly problematic because it can prevent the auction from having any acknowledged bids at all. Indeed, there is no intrinsic incentive for any bidder to sign any bids submitted by any other bidder within the Hydra head because the other bidder s bid increases the price that the bidder would have to pay to win the auction.\nSecond, only the participants listed in the Hydra head initialization can participate in a Hydra head (ie, no new participants can join), and every head participant must remain active and responsive to other participants for the head to continue operating (ie, no participant can leave without closing the Hydra head for all participants). This is a significant limitation for single-head auctions because it is highly desirable to let new bidders join ongoing auctions. Furthermore, bidders would prefer not to be stuck in auctions that they are no longer interested in, which may even lead them to exercise their veto power to close the Hydra head prematurely an undesirable outcome for single-head auctions.\nThird, Hydra head participants may only use the funds that they committed to the Hydra head before it opened. This limitation exists in the current implementation of Hydra (hydra-poc repository), but it will be lifted when incremental commits/de-commits are implemented later in the Hydra roadmap. For now, this limitation effectively caps the maximum reachable price in any Hydra-based auction that requires bids to be fully backed by bidder deposits. Furthermore, it reveals each bidder s maximum possible bid, which can be exploited by other bidders that have more funds committed to the Hydra head.\nThe interviewees indicated that all three of these limitations would have to be sufficiently mitigated for a Hydra-based auction to be viable as a product to be launched on Cardano, but that it is particularly important to overcome the first limitation for them to consider providing a Hydra-based auction on their platforms.\nIn this baseline design for a single head auction, the seller and all bidders form the set of participants of a Hydra head that they open for the auction. Several ways to mitigate the Hydra limitations for a single-head auction were considered.\nThe participant veto power with a single Hydra head can be mitigated by:\nAccess to this premium service would be provided to sufficiently KYC ed users with a high reputation and a deposit that can be slashed by the auctioneer for bad behavior. Bidders are incentivized to participate in good faith within the single-head auctions, to avoid degrading their reputation, losing access to this premium feature, and/or having their deposits slashed.\nThe requirement for participants to always be active and responsive to all participants within a Hydra head can be mitigated by using the managed head topology, where the auctioneer provides the infrastructure to broadcast Hydra head transactions and signatures between head participants and even to run some of the Hydra head software on behalf of participants. Under this topology, participants still maintain the right to withhold consent from any transaction within the Hydra head, but now the auctioneer can potentially censor the communication between participants.\nTo mitigate the effects of only the pre-committed funds being available in the auction (before incremental commits/de-commits become available on Hydra):\nSome of the interviewees indicated that this mitigated variant of the single-head auction design could potentially be viable on their platforms.\nThis design would likely be useful only in a rather niche application of an auction, but it was included here as an illustrative example because technically it can eliminate most of the rational incentives for a bidder to exercise his veto power against other bidders within a Hydra head.\nHere, bidders are required to set their respective initial secret bids when the auction is being set up before the Hydra head opens. When the head opens and until the auction closes, bidders are allowed to change their own secret bids for new bids, which may be lower or higher than their previous bids. In this way, bidders should in general have very little incentive to veto each other s bids, because they don t know if the new bids are lower or higher than before.\nOf course, the secrecy of bids in this auction is limited (as an upper bound) by the funds that each bidder commits to the Hydra head. However, this limitation can be mitigated with the same techniques as for the regular single-head auction.\nInterviewees were not particularly enthusiastic about this design, because it does not allow participants to know what the highest bid is at any time before the auction ends, and because it is not clear how valuable it is to users to be able to adjust secret bids during some period of time.\nIn this design, a group of delegates takes custody of the auction lot and the bidders deposits into the auction. Bidders submit their bids to the Hydra head by proxy through the delegates, and all delegates must sign a bid for it to take effect. Every bid must be backed by the bidder s funds within the Hydra head.\nA significant advantage of this design is that it eliminates the requirement for the seller and bidders to always be online and responsive to Hydra head participants for the auction to continue running. Furthermore, each bidder only needs to sign the bids he submits to the auction. Only the delegates that run the Hydra head consensus for the auction are required to be online and responsive during the auction, and they can be paid for providing this service reliably.\nThe bidders can be offline and idle as long as they do not wish to place any new bids, and the seller s participation is not needed after the auction lot is deposited into the Hydra head. This can be a much more pleasant user experience than in the non-custodial Hydra-based auctions, where the seller and bidders must sign every transaction that they receive within their Hydra head.\nAnother advantage of this design is that it eliminates the bidders veto power because bidders are not direct participants in the Hydra head and thus cannot withhold their signature for consensus over other bidders bids within the auction.\nUnfortunately, giving custody to the delegates over the auction lot and bidder deposits allows the delegates to collude to steal these funds from the auction. Users may be reluctant to sell high-value NFTs or participate with high deposits in a custodial auction. The auction house service itself may face additional regulatory burden and potential legal liability if it runs custodial auctions.\nSome interviewees were not supportive of running custodial auctions on Hydra, arguing that these auctions are not much different from running traditional Web2 auctions. Other interviewees indicated that they may consider running custodial auctions if the user-experience improvements outweigh the disadvantages of taking custody.\nThis design is described on the Hydra website. It does not enforce that the winning bid is paid, but it allows bidders to place bids that exceed the funds that they respectively committed to the Hydra head.\nThe auctioneer forges and distributes a 'bidding paddle token' NFT to each bidder that allows the bidder to place bids within the auction s Hydra head. The auction proceeds according to the standard English-style rules, without requiring bid deposits, and then the winning bidder is issued a voucher on layer 1 when the auction closes. The winning bidder can choose to redeem his voucher in exchange for the auction lot on layer 1, by paying the winning bid amount.\nA major advantage of this auction design is that it requires very few transactions to open and close the Hydra head, resulting in very low setup costs and possibly supporting more Hydra head participants:\nRedeeming the voucher is optional for the winning bidder, which means that the seller is not guaranteed to be paid out of the auction. Furthermore, it allows bidders to make frivolous and unreasonably high bids that they do not intend to honor, interfering with honest bidders and potentially sabotaging the auction entirely.\nOne way to mitigate this insincere bidding problem is to require each bidder to post a deposit that is deductible from the winning bid price if the bidder wins, and otherwise refundable if the bidder loses. If the bidder wins but does not redeem his voucher, the seller keeps the deductible deposit. The deductible deposit can eliminate bidders rational incentive to make insincere bids unless their profit from insincere bidding exceeds the deductible.\nThe voucher auction s insincere bidding problem can be further mitigated in the same way that bidder veto power is mitigated in the basic single-head auction. If the voucher auction is marketed as a premium service that is only accessible to KYC ed users with a high reputation, then users may avoid insincere bidding if dishonoring a winning bid carries a sufficiently severe reputational penalty on the platform. Indeed, according to one of the interviewees, who regularly participates in Discord-based NFT auctions, the risk of reputational penalty is typically sufficient to enforce that winning bidders honor their bids.\nThis design combines the voucher auction with a Hydra head run by delegates. This mitigates the risk that the delegates can collude to directly steal funds from the seller and/or bidders because the auction lot and the bidders funds remain outside the Hydra head.\nThe auction in this design works in the same way as in the voucher auction, except that bidders submit their bids into the auction by proxy through the Hydra head delegates, and the delegates multi-signature is required for bids to affect the auction state within the Hydra head. Upon auction closing, the winning bidder receives a voucher that is optionally redeemable for the auction lot on Cardano layer 1.\nThis auction design inherits the user convenience benefits from the delegated custodial auction and inherits the low Hydra head setup costs and high bidder capacity from the voucher auction. Furthermore, with incremental commits/de-commits, it may be possible for the delegates to send out the voucher to the winner of one auction, and then to re-use the bidding paddle tokens for new bidders in a subsequent auction, without closing the Hydra head. Thus, the delegates may have a viable business model operating a persistent head and renting out time on the Hydra head to various auctions.\nAs in the simple voucher auction, the insincere bidding problem can be mitigated by requiring a deposit from each bidder that is deductible from the winning bid price if the bidder wins and redeems the auction lot, refundable if the bidder loses, and forfeited to the seller if the bidder wins and does not redeem the auction lot.\nOne major difference between this design and the simple voucher auction is that bidders no longer participate directly in the Hydra head. This means that the bidders signatures are not required to authorize any state transitions within the Hydra head, and thus the delegates can authorize transactions that falsely declare bids that bidders did not submit. Of course, the winning bidder can choose not to honor such a false bid; however, if the deductible deposit requirement was included in the auction to combat insincere bidding, then the winning bidder would have to forfeit his deposit when rejecting a false bid. For example, the delegates could collude with the seller to split the winning bidder s forfeited deposit.\nTo eliminate the risk of false bids from this design, each bid transaction within the Hydra head could produce a UTXO datum that includes the bidder s signature for that bid, and the winning bidder s bid signature should be preserved in datums all the way to the issuance of the voucher to the winning bidder on layer 1. The voucher would only be valid if its UTXO datum contains the bidder s valid signature for the corresponding bid; otherwise, the voucher would be invalid and the auction outcome would be annulled.\nAnother risk that emerges from trusting the delegates to execute the auction within the Hydra Head is that they can rig the auction so that a bid other than the highest bid wins the auction. However, delegates would likely face significant reputational penalties for engaging in such auction rigging, which would compromise their ability to continue offering auction-hosting services in the future.\nFurther mitigation for the delegate auction rigging risk would be to require them to keep a copy of the Hydra head s ledger of auction transactions that resulted in the particular auction outcome that was finalized on layer 1. This copy of the auction ledger could even be archived for a sufficient period of time on storage-optimized blockchains (eg, Arweave) or layer 2 solutions (eg, Logosphere). If a bidder disputes the auction outcome with an allegation of auction rigging, the delegates could present the auction ledger as proof in an off-chain dispute resolution process.\nOverall, this design strikes the right balance between the delegated custodial and the voucher auction designs.\nThis design makes use of the star-shaped head network topology described on the Hydra website. Here, a centralized auctioneer opens a separate pairwise head with each bidder in the auction. The bidder commits into the Hydra head the funds that he would like to use in the auction, while the auctioneer does not commit any funds into the Hydra head but is instead there just to witness and timestamp the bidder s bids with his signature. The auctioneer can choose to charge fees for providing this service to the auction s bidders.\nThe auction use case can be implemented on the star-shaped Hydra network topology without requiring inter-head transfers of funds via hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs). Instead, at the end of the auction, each pairwise head is closed with its bidder s highest bid brought back to Cardano layer 1 and then the winning bid can be efficiently resolved during fanout from each head. Potentially, there may be a mechanism to resolve losing bids within their Hydra heads during the auction, allowing the losing bidders to exit the auction early if they no longer wish to continue bidding.\nThe main benefits of the star-shaped auction over the single-head auction are:\nConversely, since the auctioneer s signature is also required in each pairwise head, the auctioneer does have the power to rig the auction:\nCensoring. The auctioneer can prevent a bidder from bidding by refusing to sign his bids, rigging the auction against that bidder, and in favor of the other bidders that the auctioneer is not censoring. This is similar to the bidder veto power in the single-head auction, but it is only held by the auctioneer in the star-shaped auction.\nCollusion to dishonor a bid. The auctioneer can allow a bidder to dishonor his bids, by:\nCollusion to bid secretly. The auctioneer can allow a bidder to secretly make a higher bid than the highest bid that has been broadcast so far to all bidders. This means that the other bidders will be mistaken about what the current highest bid is and who the current highest bidder is until the auction closes or the secret bidder reveals himself as the highest bidder.\nThe two collusion powers of the auctioneer do not exist in the single-head auction. A bidder in the single-head cannot dishonor his bids because the seller would not sign a bid transaction that would lower the bidder s current bid. A bidder cannot bid secretly in the single-head auction, because every participant of the Hydra head must see and sign the bid for it to have an effect. Thus, the star-shaped auction s centralized auctioneer collusion power is its major disadvantage relative to the single-head auction.\nThis design is a generalization of the star-shaped auction that splits the auctioneer into multiple neutral parties in each bidder s head. Furthermore, it requires only M of N of the neutral parties (M N) to sign transactions within a bidder s head, in addition to the bidder s signature.\nFor example, suppose that Alice, Bob, and Charlie are bidders in an auction; and that Oskar, Patricia, Quentin, Rupert, and Sally are potential neutral parties. If we set (M = 2) and (N = 3), then we could set up the bidder Hydra heads for the auction as follows:\nThis design mitigates the centralized auction rigging potential from the star-shaped auction:\nCollusion with the bidder to dishonor or not reveal a bid is reduced because the bidder must collude with more neutral parties to collectively rig the auction in his favor.\nCensorship of bids is reduced because it requires (N - M + 1) neutral parties to refuse their signature of a bid.\nFurthermore, the M of N signature scheme can relax the neutral parties responsiveness requirements, because up to (N - M) neutral parties can briefly go offline without necessarily preventing a bid from being multi-signed in the Hydra head.\nWe could also forgo the random selection of neutral parties for each bidder s Hydra head, instead using a fixed group of independent neutral parties in every head. For instance, this could be a federation of independent auctioneers that would keep each other honest in the auctions that they co-host for users.\nTo further reduce neutral parties auction rigging potential, they can be randomly selected for each bidder's head from a large pool of potential neutral parties, perhaps similar to the verifiable random function (VRF) based lottery used on Cardano layer 1 to select slot leaders to add blocks to the chain.\nIn a sense, this Hydra head lottery could be seen as a natural generalization of Cardano s slot leader lottery from layer 1 to layer 2. In the first layer, slot leaders are randomly selected to add blocks of user-signed transactions to the main chain. In the second layer, neutral parties are randomly selected to mediate the transient transactions within a Hydra head and then to help bring the final result back to the main chain. Indeed, the large network of stake pools on Cardano could be tapped to also provide neutral party services on layer 2, as another revenue stream that makes use of their existing computing resources.\nFor the implementation phase of this project, the delegated voucher auction design was selected because it significantly mitigates the three major limitations of the Hydra head protocol that the interviewees indicated are discouraging them from pursuing Hydra-based solutions. Based on our business analysis, the reference implementation based on this design could be viably adapted into an auction service on the Cardano main network.\nFurthermore, this design can demonstrate to the Cardano community that if they move past the basic single-head model, a wider range of use cases becomes feasible by applying techniques like:\nRegarding the star-shaped and constellation schema auction designs, they are interesting designs that quite intrigued the interviewees. However, they are also significantly more complex than the delegated voucher auction design. Furthermore, they require not-yet-implemented Hydra head features to be available, for the benefits of these designs to be apparent in a demonstration of the reference implementation. Therefore, it is recommended that they should be considered for a future Hydra-based auction project, perhaps even by some of the business analysis respondents if our current project gives them confidence that they can pursue their own Hydra-based DApp projects.\nIn the implementation phase, IOG and MLabs will prioritize implementing only the core English-style auction features within the delegated voucher design. Once those are implemented, the additional English-style auction features can be pursued as nice-to-have features. The reason for this prioritization is that respondents and interviewees in the business analysis indicated that they prefer seeing the Hydra limitations properly resolved for the auction use case, overseeing non-core features implemented in the Hydra-based auction.\nAt the end of this phase, the auction implementation should provide the following features:\nA group of delegates can open a Hydra head capable of hosting an auction for an NFT asset provided by a seller.\nThe seller can distribute the right to participate (eg, via participation tokens) in the auction to prospective bidders who have locked their deductible deposits for the auction.\nEach bidder can submit a bid to the auction by sending it to one of the delegates, who will then broadcast it to the rest of the delegates.\nDelegates can collectively acknowledge bids by multi-signing via the Hydra Head protocol, thus including the bids in the Hydra head ledger state.\nWhen the auction deadline elapses, the delegates can deterministically settle the bids within the Hydra head to determine the winning bid.\nDelegates can close the Hydra head:\nLosing bidders can redeem their deductible deposits when the auction s Hydra head closes and the auction is settled.\nThe winning bidder can use the funds in his deductible deposit in his payment to the seller for the NFT asset.\nWhen the voucher is issued to the winning bidder, a deadline is set to redeem the seller s NFT asset. If the winning bidder does not redeem the seller s NFT asset by the deadline, the seller can claim the winning bidder s deductible deposit.\nThe voucher UTXO can only be spent by the winning bidder to redeem the seller s NFT, or by the seller to claim the winning bidder s deductible deposit after the redemption deadline.\nWe will also develop a technical specification for enhancing the above implementation with bidder-signed bids, whereby:\nThe above auction implementation will significantly resolve the three major Hydra head limitations for the auction use case. However, several further improvements could be made to make it even more suitable as a real-world product. We are not committed to implementing them as part of this project s scope, but mention them here and will continue to think of more improvements, so that future developers can have a clear vision of how to make the best possible Hydra-based auction for their users.\nThe auction implementation will require bidder signatures to authorize bids, to prevent delegates from forging false bids, but it cannot prevent the delegates from collectively rigging the auction so that the highest bid does not win the auction. A future improvement to the auction implementation would be to provide tools that preserve the delegates Hydra head ledger of auction transactions, to facilitate off-chain dispute resolution with the seller and bidders. Furthermore, perhaps additional information (eg, a ZKP proof) derived from the Hydra head ledger could be brought back to layer 1 during auction settlement and voucher issuance.\nAnother improvement to the auction would be to allow the Hydra head to remain open while one auction s outcome is settled to layer 1 and another auction is onboarded for bidding. This would likely require the incremental commit/de-commit feature that is planned on the Hydra Head protocol roadmap.\nA third improvement to the auction would be to allow each bidder to unilaterally lock his funds on layer 1 as ad hoc deposits towards the auction, and then provide proof of these locked funds when submitting bids within the auction. These variable deposits could provide full collateralization for all bids within the auction, thus eliminating the need for the upfront fixed deductible deposit from each bidder.\nLastly, the auction implementation could be improved by allowing the delegates consensus threshold to be relaxed for some auctions from unanimity to an M of N signature scheme. This would make the auction more robust against a single delegate losing connection or maliciously sabotaging the Hydra head, though it would be slightly less secure than a unanimous consent threshold against collective collusion by the delegators against the seller and/or bidders.\nAs IOG and MLabs explored the design space for the Hydra-based auction, the importance of certain Hydra Head protocol features to facilitate better auction designs was realized. Some of these are already on the Hydra Head protocolroadmap as planned features, while others are new features that we discovered as we brainstormed auction designs.\nThe following feature is not yet implemented for the Hydra Head protocol, but it is on the roadmap:\nIncremental commit/de-commit of UTXOs to a Hydra head would allow for DApp designs that use longer-lasting Hydra heads. For auctions, instead of opening and closing a Hydra head (or network of Hydra heads) every time that an auction is hosted, the same heads could be kept running, with the results of each auction de-committed to the main chain and UTXOs for the next auction committed to the Hydra head.\nThe following features should be considered for the Hydra Head protocol roadmap, as they would facilitate certain desirable properties for auctions and similar DApps built on Hydra:\nDynamic membership within a Hydra head. Particularly for auctions, participants should be able to freely enter and leave the Hydra head, when they are not obligated to stay as the highest bidder in the auction. If participants feel like they re locked inside of a Hydra head, that may give them the incentive to close the Hydra head so that they could get out. If they could instead leave gracefully without closing the Hydra head for the other participants, that would be an improvement in application UX.\nNeutral party role in a Hydra head, with M of N signing threshold for neutral parties. As explained in the constellation schema design above, this feature would enable us to split a centralized trusted party within a Hydra head (eg, auctioneer in a star-shaped auction) into a group of neutral parties, while calibrating for robustness against collusion and censoring by the neutral parties.\nOf the above features, only the incremental commit/de-commit will substantially improve the delegated voucher auction that we have chosen for implementation. The rest of the features would amplify the effectiveness of the alternative designs that we ve considered.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

They are now working on refining and adapting more tests, refactoring the code to accommodate the fixes, and assessing the performance of the in-memory backend. April s mid-month development update is going live on Thursday (April, 14th), featuring the latest progress on ledger development.\nThe networking team reviewed node-to-node and node-to-client protocol versions and removed obsolete ones. They updated the cardano-ping mini-protocol to support available versions and continued working on IOSim timeouts and typed-protocols refactorization.\nThey also identified (and designed a fix for) a security issue within IPv6 deployments and communicated it to the SPO community. Finally, the team continued working on the design of the Gossip Protocol and Eclipse Evasion, which will drive forward a more robust and decentralized P2P network.\nThis week, the Daedalus team released Daedalus v.4.9.1. They also updated some packages and resolved several vulnerability issues. The team converted the Daedalus Nix infrastructure to use Nix Flakes, which assures compatibility with the cardano-wallet, and also migrated the Daedalus project to Webpack 5, allowing for faster reload when coding new features. They also polished the analytics integration to be used in future versions of Daedalus, and fixed a bug to allow for the correct deletion of the Daedalus installer file after the upgrade.\nThe Adrestia team continued working on a new transaction workflow to add token minting and burning, and also worked on DB layer redesign and the addition of a light mode to cardano-wallet. Finally, work is still ongoing on cardano-js-sdk MVP.\nThis week, the Plutus team continued working on Plutus Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) and updated documentation.

They also fixed the contract carousel in the Marlowe dashboard when reopening and deployed a copy of Cardano Explorer that points to the testnet. Finally, the team made several changes to contracts to correctly reflect balances and metadata.\nThe Hydra team worked on measuring script cost execution of the various on-chain scripts driving the Hydra protocol. A new command-line option was also added to the Hydra node to allow starting a Head from a point in the past - previously, Hydra nodes would only start from the most recent chain tip. This gives ways for users to restart their Hydra node and recover some state in the past if needed.\nThe team also worked to provide more resilience to chain forks (e.g. due to on-chain slot battles). Information on the blockchain is only eventually immutable and because of the distributed nature of the protocol, recent information received from a node may be overridden non-predictably. DApps such as Hydra must therefore acknowledge those changes and react accordingly to maintain an internally consistent state.\nFund8 is entering its voting stage next Thursday (21st April), where ada holders will vote on hundreds of projects ranging from big to small, spanning dozens of countries.\nApplications to join the first cohort of dReps reopened and will stay open for a further week.

    "prompt": "Babel fees denominating transaction costs in native tokens?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nProf Aggelos Kiayias - Chief Scientist\nOriginally published on IOG.io: February 25, 2021\nSummary:\nIntroducing a novel mechanism that allows the payment of transaction fees in user-defined tokens on Cardano.\nArticle:\nIn Douglas Adams' classic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a Babel fish is a creature that allows you to hear any language translated into your own. This fantasy of universal translation ensures meaningful interaction despite the myriad different languages in the galaxy.\nIn the cryptocurrency space, smart contract platforms enable the development of a myriad of custom tokens. Is it possible to interact with the platform using your preferred token? If only there was a Babel fees mechanism to translate the token you use to the one that the platform requires for posting a transaction.\nCommon wisdom in blockchain systems suggests that posting a valid transaction must incur a cost to the sender. The argument is that, without such constraint, there is nothing to stop anyone from overloading the system with trivial transactions saturating its capacity and rendering it unusable. Given the above tenet, a frequently made corollary is that in any blockchain system where user-defined tokens are supported, it should be prohibited to pay transaction fees in such tokens. Instead, transactions should carry a fee in the native token of the platform that is accepted by all participants as being valuable. Arguably such a restriction is undesirable. But how is it possible to circumvent the ensuing and seemingly inevitable vulnerability?\nCryptography and game theory have been known to make possible what seemed impossible. Celebrated examples include key exchange over a public channel, Merkle's puzzles, and auctions where being truthful is the rational thing to do, like Vickrey's auctions. And so it also turns out in this case.\nFirst, let us recall how native assets work in Cardano: Tokens can be created according to a minting policy and they are treated natively in the ledger along with ada. Cardano's ledger adopts the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model, and issuing a valid transaction requires consuming one or more UTXOs. A UTXO in Cardano may carry not just ada but in fact, a token bundle that can contain multiple different tokens, both fungible and non-fungible. In this way, it is possible to write transactions that transfer multiple different tokens with a single UTXO.\nTransaction fees in the ledger are denominated in ada according to a function fixed as a ledger parameter. A powerful feature of Cardano's EUTXO model is that the fees required for a valid transaction can be predicted precisely prior to posting it. This is a unique feature that is not enjoyed by other ledger arrangements (such as the account-based model used in Ethereum). Indeed, in this latter case, the fees needed for a transaction may change during the time it takes for the transaction to settle, since other transactions may affect the ledger's state in between and influence the required cost for processing the transaction.\nLet's consider the following thought experiment to help us move closer to our objective of Babel fees. Imagine that it is possible to issue a transaction that declares a liability denominated in ada equal to the number of fees that the transaction issuer is supposed to pay. Such a transaction would not be admissible to the ledger. However, it can be perceived as an open offer that asks for the liability to be covered. Why would anyone respond to such an offer? To entice a response, assuming the token bundle concept is already present in Cardano, the transaction can offer some amount of token(s) to whoever covers the liability. This suggests a spot trade between ada and the offered token(s) at a certain exchange rate. Consider now a block producer that sees such a transaction. The block producer can create a matching transaction absorbing the liability covering it with ada as well as claiming the tokens that are on offer.\nBy suitably extending the ledger rules, the transaction with the liability as well as its matching transaction becomes admissible to the ledger as a group. Due to the absorption of the liability, the set of two transactions becomes properly priced in ada as a whole and hence it does not break the ledgers' bookkeeping rules in terms of ada fees. As a result, the transaction with the liability settles, and we have achieved our objective. Users can submit transactions priced in any token(s) they possess and, providing a block producer is willing to take them up on the spot trade, have them settle in the ledger as regular transactions!\nThe mechanism is of course conditioned on the presence of liquidity providers that possess ada and are willing to issue matching transactions. In fact, the mechanism creates a market for such liquidity providers. For instance, a stake pool operator (SPO), can publish exchange rates for specific tokens they consider acceptable. For instance, an SPO can declare that it will accept tokenX for an exchange rate of 3:1 over ada. It follows that if a transaction costs, say 0.16, the transaction can declare a liability of 0.16 as well as offer 0.48 of tokenX. In the native asset model of Cardano, this can be implemented as a single UTXO carrying a token bundle with the following specification (Ada -0.16, tokenX 0.48). Note the negative sign signifying the liability.\nSuppose now that the SPO is about to produce a block. She recovers the liability transaction from the mempool and issues a matching transaction consuming the UTXO with the liability. The matching transaction transfers 0.48 of tokenX to a new output which is owned by the SPO. The resulting block contains the two transactions in sequence. The matching transaction provides the missing 0.16 in addition to the fees that are needed for itself. In fact, multiple transactions can be batched together and have their fees covered by a single matching transaction.\nFigure. Alice sends a quantity of 9 tokens of type X to Bob with the assistance of Stacy, an SPO, who covers Alice's transaction liability and receives tokens of type X in exchange. The implied exchange rate between X and Ada is 3:1.\nThe above process is entirely opt-in for SPOs. Each one can determine their own policy and exchange rate as well as decide to change the exchange rate for the various tokens they accept on the spot. Moreover, there is no need for agreement between SPOs about the value of a specific token. In fact, different SPOs may provide different exchange rates for the same token and a user issuing a liability transaction can offer a number of tokens corresponding to the minimum, average, or even maximum of the posted exchange rates in the network. In this way, a natural trade-off arises between the settlement time of liability transactions and the market value of tokens they offer.\nThis illustrates how native assets, the EUTXO model, and the simple but powerful tweak of introducing liabilities in the form of negative values in token bundles can accommodate Babel fees empowering users to price transactions in any token supported natively by the system. It also shows the unique advantage of being an SPO in such a system. It should be noted that SPOs need not be the only entities in the network offering to cover liabilities. In fact, an SPO can readily partner -if they wish- with an external liquidity provider who will be issuing the matching transactions. In addition, third-party providers can also act on the network independently and issue matching transactions. Nevertheless, the benefit will remain with the block producers; SPOs can always front-run matching transactions and substitute them for their own if they wish so. This is a case in which front-running transactions is a feature: it makes it feasible for SPOs to be paid in the tokens they prefer for their transaction processing services.\nThe mechanism of negative quantities in token bundles can be implemented in the basic ledger rules of Cardano at some point following the introduction of native assets with the Mary Hard Fork. Beyond Babel fees, the mechanism allows a variety of other interesting applications, such as atomic swaps for spot trades, that we will cover in a future blog post. It is yet another illustration of the power of Cardano's approach and its ability to support a diverse and entrepreneurial community of users and stake pool operators.\nI am grateful to Manuel Chakravarty, Michael Peyton Jones, Nikos Karagiannidis, Chad Nester, and Polina Vinogradova for helpful discussions, suggestions, and comments related to the concept of Babel fees and its implementation in the Cardano ledger. We also have a video whiteboard walkthrough covering this topic.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Concurrency and all that Cardano smart contracts and the EUTXO model?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nOlga Hryniuk - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: September 10, 2021\nSummary:\nCardano s EUTXO model provides a secure and versatile environment to process multiple operations without system failures\nArticle:\nCardano is a UTXO-based blockchain, which utilizes a different programming paradigm for decentralized applications (DApps) from other account-based blockchains like Ethereum. The specific flavor Cardano uses is the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model introduced by the Alonzo upgrade. EUTXO offers greater security allowing for smart contract execution cost predictability (without unpleasant surprises) and, as a result, offers a different approach to parallelization.\nEUTXO inherits the per-branches design of the UTXO (Bitcoin) model, where one branch is by definition a sequence of transactions that requires a sequence of validations. To split the logic across different branches and enforce more parallelism, it is essential to build DApps and other solutions using multiple UTXOs. This provides benefits in terms of scaling, just like developing Bitcoin services prerequisites splitting one wallet into sub wallets.\nDApps built on Cardano are not limited to one transaction per block. In fact, the block budget (that is the maximum number of transactions it can hold) allows the execution of hundreds of simple transactions and several complex scripts. However, the EUTXO model allows spending a transaction output only once. Given that users can face contention issues trying to access the same UTXO, it is important to use many different UTXOs. Note that this is important unless such a design would benefit from a strict ordering of clients. Sets of UTXOs can be used to implement design patterns that include semaphores. In addition, different users can interact with one smart contract without any concurrency failure. That is because a smart contract can handle a number of different UTXOs that make up its current state and off-chain metadata that allows interpreting those UTXOs.\nBlockchains achieve immutability and transparency of transaction processing differently. Any blockchain system should have a set of properties to meet the ever-growing need for secure yet swift operation processing, namely:\nThroughput the number of operations a system can perform within a certain time period. This relates, for example, to the number of transactions or smart contracts processed in one second.\nPerformance how fast the system works. Performance measures the time of transaction or smart contract execution.\nScalability the ability of the system to perform multiple operations without overloading the network or influencing performance properties.\nBy increasing parallelism, we can ultimately improve the throughput of the system while keeping the performance of individual operations the same, but this sort of scalability will always be limited by the degree of contention.\nWhen it comes to scalability, we also distinguish such system properties as concurrency, parallelism, and contention. Concurrency is essential to allow multiple actors to progress on a certain task without interfering with each other. Parallelism allows such progress at the same time without any interference. Contention occurs when those multiple actors interfere with each other while working either concurrently or in parallel.\nConcurrency may or may not improve a system s performance, throughput, or responsiveness. The amount of concurrency limits the maximum number of simultaneous operations that can be performed.\nTo obtain actual performance improvements in a UTXO-based blockchain, processors or other actors should be able to perform multiple actions simultaneously. The higher the level of concurrency, the higher the maximum possible parallelism. Such an approach then translates to performance improvements and throughput. It also provides significant advantages over account-based systems (like Ethereum).\nCardano s approach to DApp deployment is different and thus it requires a learning curve and a different approach. This is like working with different programming languages: there is one goal to deploy a solution, but so many programming languages to use for this purpose.\nMaximizing concurrency is a skill that needs to be learned: developers need to write code in a way that severely restricts the opportunities for contention (e.g., by avoiding shared states and accidental dependencies). The system must then translate this concurrency into parallelism. A number of developers have already identified ways to approach this, while others are still developing solutions. Simply transplanting lessons learned on one blockchain will not work; while the learning curve is a little steeper, the results make this worthwhile.\nEither way, it is important to understand that to deploy a scalable DApp on Cardano, a developer can t just use an adapted Ethereum contract. Cardano is based on the UTXO model; it is not account-based. And this means that a single on-chain state will not meet the concurrency property on Cardano. Instead, DApps should split up their on-chain state across many UTXOs. This will increase the concurrency in their application, thereby allowing higher throughput.\nOur education team has previously shared a simple AMM-style DEX implementation in the Plutus Pioneer course. While this is useful for teaching purposes, this architecture would not directly support a commercial DEX where an order book approach and additional concurrency are required. A developer looking to deploy on the Cardano mainnet would need to improve the scalability of the architecture accordingly.\nWe proposed a solution within our recent Djed stablecoin paper. For the Djed implementation on Cardano, an order book modeling pattern is favored whereby an order maker is responsible for forwarding any minting or burning order to the stablecoin smart contract, with an additional incentive fee imposed on each would-be buyer or seller of stablecoins and reserve coins. Several security mechanisms via the extensive use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also used to guarantee the uniqueness of transactions, the correctness of each submitted order, and to prevent front-running attacks. NFT tokens are also used to report successful or failed minting and burning orders. We ll publish a fuller article on this shortly.\nTo learn more about scalability, you can read how to design a scalable Plutus application and find out how to organize DApps on Cardano using order book patterns. Developers have also presented concurrent and deterministic approaches to the EUTXO smart contract architecture that might be regarded as a generalization of the parallel state machine steps introduced in the Hydra paper to realize multi-step state machines. A number of other developers and community members have also published papers, videos, articles, and useful threads on Twitter outlining their approaches. It s a brilliant lesson in how the community will continue to develop its own innovative solutions, as approaches become more standardized with platform maturity.\nThe Alonzo hard fork event will introduce the core building blocks of Plutus 1.0. This is the beginning of ecosystem growth. Although it is still early, the Alonzo testnet allows our developers to assess system properties and build scalable DApps in advance preparing for their mainnet launch. Dozens of projects have already been working with local instances of Plutus environments. With the main public testnet soon supporting smart contracts, we expect a significant ramping up of activity over the next few weeks and in the months ahead. Later this month, the Cardano summit (25-26 September) will showcase many of these projects, plus provide important updates on the smart contracts roadmap and the ongoing evolution of the technology stack. Developer events, hackathons, and, of course, the results of Project Catalyst will continue to bring new tools and abstractions to this fast-growing developer ecosystem.\nIf you are a developer, make sure to join our Discord community and get involved with Project Catalyst if you are looking to fund your project.\nI'd like to acknowledge Lars Br njes, Jann M ller, and Manuel Chakravarty for their technical input and support during the blog post preparation.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Plutus fee estimator find out the cost of transacting on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nKevin Hammond - Software Engineer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: January 21, 2022\nSummary:\nOur new fee estimator released today will help developers estimate the cost of smart contract scripts for maximum efficiency and minimum cost\nArticle:\nThe Alonzo smart contract upgrade deployed to the Cardano mainnet in September 2021 turned Cardano into a functional platform for the development of decentralized applications (DApps) built in Plutus.\nWith the Cardano ecosystem steadily growing, a great number of DApps are being built and readied for launch on Cardano. Either in final testing, deployment, or active development, Cardano will soon host a variety of DApps covering DeFi offerings, NFT markets, wallets, exchanges, games, and more.\nThe deterministic design of the Cardano ledger allows developers to predict how much they will pay for contract execution and there s no fee for contract failure. Deterministic transaction processing, low fees, and security all of these are major benefits of transacting and building on Cardano. Here, we ll take a closer look at Cardano pricing and introduce a new Plutus fee estimator developed to provide better clarity on the processing fees.\nMany factors influence a blockchain's price competitiveness: functionality, quality, security, and, of course, liquidity.\nThe design principles underpinning the Cardano ledger ensure high performance while respecting rigorous security properties. Cardano uses an Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) accounting model, which greatly contributes to its deterministic design. Determinism refers to the predictability of outcomes. This means that Cardano transactions and scripts can be validated locally (off-chain), so letting the user know if a transaction is valid before executing it on-chain and without paying any fees. Moreover, transaction fees are fixed and predictable. To compare, smart contract execution costs on Ethereum vary depending on the network load, with fees fluctuating from $5 to hundreds of dollars (see The ridiculously high cost of Gas on Ethereum). Moreover, even failed Ethereum transactions may also incur fees, creating additional uncertainty about pricing.\nIn contrast, on Cardano, users can calculate the potential fees for transaction processing in advance. Because the user knows in advance whether the transaction is valid or not, there is no need to pay for a transaction that will potentially fail. This saves wasting funds and eliminates on-chain failures. Cardano s execution fee in ada is always stable as it depends on pre-set network protocol parameters rather than on varying network congestion factors, for example.\nCardano s approach to price setting mainly relies on market demand over actual supply. With smart contract support on Cardano, there is now more than one type of demand competing for the common supply. Thus, it is crucial to consider both relative and absolute pricing. One way to do this is to inspect the effects of smart contract pricing, non-fungible token (NFT) operations, etc., with respect to some common value in our case, the consumption of Cardano s processing power.\nWith Cardano, smart contract pricing model is based on a fixed cost, which relies on the pricing of the spent resources (UTXO size or computation/memory used when running).\nFees must be paid to fairly compensate for stake pool operation (SPO) work and for the resources used to validate network transactions. In addition, making sure that any particular way of using Cardano is not substantially cheaper than another helps mitigate whole classes of adversarial attacks (e.g. a classic DDoS attack).\nFlexibility is also key and an important feature of the Cardano protocol as it provides the possibility to change its parameters and adapt to price fluctuations. For example, if ada significantly increases in value, protocol parameters can, if required, be adjusted to prevent the user from overpaying for smart contract execution.\nThe Plutus fee estimator tool has been developed by IOG for price benchmarking and comparison. Today we are making it available for developers or curious Cardano users on our public testnet site. The estimator uses information from real-world Plutus transactions to predict the fees that will be charged for a transaction. The estimator can be used to calculate fees for actual transactions (e.g. to determine the fees that will be charged if the network parameters change), and also to estimate fees for individual script transactions or complete DApps before or during development. It may also be useful to determine the effect of script changes or optimizations on fees.\nThe estimator uses the same fee calculation formula as the actual Cardano node. Given sufficiently accurate inputs, it can give an accurate idea of the required fee. By combining the costs from multiple transactions, a user can easily predict how much a whole DApp might cost. This will be valuable for developers, business analysts, etc. The estimator includes a number of examples based on real transactions that have been verified against actual fees.\nFee calculation requires three pieces of information:\nLet s take a look at example Plutus scripts to understand their execution costs (Figure 1):\nFigure 1. Estimated fees for script processing on Cardano\nThe estimator shows that sending a simple transaction would be as cheap as 0.17 ada, whereas the maximum possible cost for a single script would be 2.17 ada.\nThe calculation can be extended to DApp execution (see Figure 2). For example, a DApp using three transactions (one simple and two script transactions) might cost ~ 1.50 ada.\nFigure 2. Estimated fees for DApp execution on Cardano\nThe Alonzo HFC event enabled Plutus script execution on the Cardano mainnet. This was really just the beginning of the journey for Cardano smart contracts. Now, with the launch of major smart contracts projects, we can begin the process of optimization and scaling. This includes the ongoing assessment of actual, real-world smart contract usage.\nWe need to balance the needs of the user and what is good for the network, speed versus correctness, and as ever striking that balance between security, scalability, and decentralization.\nFuture code/script optimizations and system performance improvements will help to refine the Cardano fees model over time. Together with our developer and stake pool operator communities, we will monitor the growth of smart contracts, optimize the Cardano node and the Plutus interpreter implementations, and make other adjustments to best support our user base in terms of fair and predictable transaction fees.\nCheck out the Plutus fee estimator and be sure you can easily estimate the processing fee without losing your funds in case of transaction failure.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Network traffic and tiered pricing?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nPhilip Lazos - Research Fellow\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: November 26, 2021\nSummary:\nDecentralized finance will continue to build demand on Cardano. Our research project is looking at ways to maintain fair access and throughput for every user\nArticle:\nA recent blog post outlined some of the ways in which the Cardano network would flex and evolve to meet the global demands of smart contracts and DeFi. Similarly, it will become necessary to upgrade the transaction fee system used for Cardano.\nThe current system is simple and fair: every transaction is treated the same and it is not possible for users to alter their priority by paying higher fees. As long as the throughput capacity is comparable to the demand, this approach works well.\nThere are, however, drawbacks. As the use of Cardano increases, there will, eventually, come a point when not all transactions will be able to be included in the blockchain, even with adjustments to the parameterization. Although increasing the capacity of the main chain and/or diverting transactions to Hydra or other layer 2 solutions can alleviate this concern, the core system must still work in an agile way in all possible cases and at all times.\nThis is especially relevant in the case of a denial of service (DoS) attack. With the system as is, an attacker could take advantage of the fair treatment and pass off their malicious spam as legitimate transactions, increasing waiting times for everyone else. There are measures in place (eg, relating to transaction propagation through the peer-to-peer network) that make such an attack technically challenging. However, for extra protection, we would like to be able to increase the costs of such attacks without jeopardizing the fairness and price efficiency of the whole system.\nThis is a topic members of IO Group s research team have been looking at this year. The resulting approach proposed in this post maintains the pillars of Cardano transaction processing (predictability, fairness, and inexpensive access) while mitigating the issues that could arise from greater demand. Our approach puts forth a novel transaction fee mechanism for blockchains. The key to the design is partitioning each block into three tiers based on the use case. Each tier makes up a set percentage of the maximum block size and is designed for different types of transactions (Figure 1). The tiers, along with the suggested split we are analyzing at present, would be:\nfair (50 )\nbalanced (30 )\nimmediate (20 )\nWe will discuss the fair segment last because it works differently from the other two. Balanced and immediate work by having a fee threshold , which is different for each. To be included in a block, transaction issuers would specify the tier of service they need. This can be done by setting a maximum fee for the transaction. Then, each block would be filled starting with the immediate, then balanced, and finally fair tiers. Similar transactions within the same tier would pay the same fee. To make this choice simple, each transaction would only be charged the lowest fee that would guarantee its entry in the block. After every block, fees for immediate and balanced tiers would be updated dynamically and deterministically (reflecting the level of demand in previous blocks) to ensure that each segment uses its target percentage of the block.\nThe difference between immediate and balanced tiers is in the way fees would be updated, specifically the speed at which they adjust given the current load. The threshold for immediate service would always be higher than balanced and would react more sharply to demand, ensuring that the transaction asking for it would be serviced as soon as possible. The balanced threshold would be slower to adapt and more stable: this would make it unsuitable for time-sensitive transactions but would provide a lower, more reliable price at the expense of a more varied waiting time.\nWhile the balanced and immediate tiers aim to handle transactions with different levels of urgency, the fair tier handles ordinary transactions. The fair segment is intended to serve as a refinement of the current system in Cardano, keeping the fees low (or in the future even stable, by pegging to a basket of commodities/fiat, as explained in the post on stablefees) and removing any unpredictability from the user s perspective. As long as demand is low (and the transactions fit into half of the block) this segment would function as Cardano does now.\nHowever, once demand rises, a special mechanism would kick in for fair tier transactions. The mechanism would filter transactions in a manner independent of fees and be based on a prioritization function. One example of this would be to give priority to transactions depending on the age and amount of their UTXOs. In particular, the priority of a given transaction would be equal to the sum of the amount of each input multiplied by its age and then divided by the total size of the transactions in bytes. This priority could be used in conjunction with a threshold (updated dynamically after every block) that would filter transactions whose priority is too low. Such an approach guarantees liveness for each transaction at a low and predictable price and limits the effect a malicious attacker (or a surge of demand) could have on prices, by always providing an inexpensive way into each block.\nThe tiered pricing idea presented here also extends and clarifies the concept of the multiplier that we introduced in the stablefees post. Viewed in this way, each of the three tiers is associated with a deterministically calculated multiplier (with the fair tier always at a multiplier of 1) whose value depends on the congestion of the respective tier in previous blocks.\nThis mechanism is different from current pricing approaches, as used by Bitcoin or Ethereum (even with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559), where there is a variable fee that each transaction must exceed to make it into a block. The downside of this approach is that the fee everyone needs to pay is dictated by the richest consumers. Even worse, this is the fee paid by the richest consumers to make it into a block immediately . In addition, even though the fees are mostly a function of supply and demand, these particular types of transaction fee mechanisms can inadvertently shape demand, or inadvertently increase prices because the optimal bidding strategy is not clear to users. Imagine if the transaction fees of Bitcoin were halved suddenly and everyone forgot what they used to be, would they still rise to their current levels? Answering no to this question illustrates the downsides of such mechanisms and is a predicament that tiered pricing precludes by design.\nThe tiered approach is more refined. It understands that not every transaction has the same needs, ensuring that different use cases can happen simultaneously and making it easy for users to choose the desired type of service. In this way, tiered pricing makes it possible to have predictable and fair fees while managing periods of congestion on the main chain. Combined with design improvements to be revealed in later posts that focus on increasing the raw throughput capacity and processing power of the main chain, tiered pricing shows how Cardano will be able to accommodate any circumstance of transaction processing demand.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Giorgos Panagiotakos, Aggelos Kiayias, and Elias Koutsoupias to this post. Together we form the research group working on the design of this mechanism. A technical paper will be available soon.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "How FiatBacked and Algorithmic Stablecoins Like USDA and DJED Benefit Cardano?",
    "completion": "The Cardano blockchain was built with the vision of being the foundation for a better financial system that fosters economic empowerment for all. We believe that stablecoins are and will be the key to unlocking the promise of Cardano. EMURGO Fintech is excited to build products and services, like our fiat-backed USDA stablecoin, that hypercharge our ability to achieve our mission.\nStablecoins are an elegant solution to volatility and transactional challenges for both the Cardano blockchain and all across crypto. They offer all of the same benefits of traditional cryptocurrencies but are tied to the price of a fiat currency, most commonly US dollars, and therefore protected from the price volatility that other tokens often experience.\nA lack of a stable currency limits our Cardano community, making many applications particularly in DeFi difficult or outright impossible. Volatility in cryptocurrency can make users fearful and overly cautious, causing hesitation in both users and businesses looking to participate in Web3. While a lack of simple, easy on-ramps is another huge barrier to achieving our vision, volatile tokens are also poor for collateralization and limit the utility of DeFi.\nCardano-native stablecoins will support our community members who are developing products that work for everyone, provide stability and security, and address the needs of our community and the wider crypto ecosystem.\nThere are, of course, several approaches to creating a Cardano-native stablecoin, but they share the same goal: to provide a native, dependable, stable asset for Cardano users. Let s break down the difference between two premier stablecoins on Cardano.\nThese tokens work exactly how you imagine. If each token is pegged to $1, then every time a token is purchased, $1 is deposited into the treasury backing the currency. These tokens remain stable because, at the end of the day, every single token corresponds to a dollar sitting in a bank account. In practice, fiat-backed stablecoins are often backed by a mix of real-world assets US Dollars, Euros, Gold, Palladium, etc. In the case of Cardano s native fiat stablecoin, USDA, tokens will be backed by the U.S. dollar with our regulated banking partner in the US.\nAlgorithmic stablecoins are not backed 1:1 but, instead, they use algorithms to maintain a set token price. It s been said that the most trustworthy algorithmic stablecoins are overcollateralized meaning if there are 1,000 USD stablecoins in circulation, there is MORE than $1,000 worth of assets backing them. One example of an overcollateralized, algorithmic stablecoin on Cardano is Djed, which was developed by DeFi service provider COTI and is pegged to the US dollar. Djed maintains its price by balancing the supply of Djed against the supply of a reserve token called SHEN. Djed is backed by Cardano s ADA token, meaning users wanting the stablecoin send ADA to the smart contract and receive minted Djed in return.\nBoth stablecoins are suitable for many purposes such as payments, lending, payroll, settlements, alternate banking, remittances, and more! The benefits to the Cardano community and, in the future, new users, are endless, so let s dive into a few of these opportunities.\nThese recently developed stablecoins will invite new integrations to the community. Stablecoins make Cardano more attractive for traditional retailers, dApps, DEXs, company treasuries, DeFi enthusiasts, and many more. We ll all benefit from the exciting new partners stablecoins invite into the fold.\nThey will also serve to improve DeFi tools. Users taking out a loan through Cardano lending protocols can take comfort in knowing that they will not face liquidation unless the US government faces a major collapse. Stable collateral is essential to DeFi and will help reduce risk and market contagion events like many we ve seen play out over the past year.\nUSDA and Djed will also offer new ways to pay. Sometimes it s just more convenient to pay for something denominated in USD. No one ever said more options were a bad thing!\nAnd finally, these stablecoins will give Web3 newcomers a low-stress way to participate. Many users want to explore the benefits of Web3 without making an investment. They don t want to take the time to pour over candlesticks and be concerned about if they re buying crypto at the opportune price they may want to check out a DApp! Stablecoins allow users a quick way to join the ecosystem without the stress that their purchasing power might drop over time.\nUSDA Cardano s regulatory-compliant USD-backed stablecoin for the ecosystem is scheduled to launch in early 2023 and bring value to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of decentralized applications. USDA will be a native token to the Cardano blockchain that is backed 1:1 by real-world reserves. It s meant to be a stable asset that can unlock fast global transactions without legacy banking and payment infrastructure delays. USDA is the key that will unlock all of the future use cases and applications that will be available on Anzens.\nJoin the waitlist now at https://www.anzens.com to be ready for Cardano s USDA stablecoin.\nAbout USDA\nOfficial Homepage: anzens.com\nTwitter: @AnzensOfficial\nAbout EMURGO\nOfficial Homepage: emurgo.io\nTwitter (Global): @EMURGO_io\nYouTube: EMURGO channel\nDiscord: EMURGO Community\nFacebook: @EMURGO.io\nInstagram: @EMURGO_io\nLinkedIn: @EMURGO_io\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "completion": "Original author:\nAnthony Quinn - Editor\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: December 27, 2021\nSummary:\nBeeple used to illustrate our blog posts, but art NFTs made him a millionaire, and then AI and DeFi arrived\nArticle:\nIncredibly, given the state of our Covid-shocked world back in January, 2021 has had its fair share of fun. And if 2020 was a big year for Cardano with the upgrade from Byron to Shelley, this year was bigger still. Decentralized block production arrived, tokens went native, contracts turned smart and there were some world firsts. But, our review of the year is getting ahead of itself, so let s think back to January....\nA hundred community stake pools benefitted when IO Group set out its strategy for delegating its ada funds in 2021. All but one of the IOG public pools were closed and the stake was moved to community operators, to the tune of three million ada per pool. Throughout the year, some 300 pools benefited from the greater chance this gave them to mint blocks. Over the year, the total number of pools running the network has increased by half to about 3,000.\nThen, IOG turned to encouraging developers and innovators with Project Catalyst. This experiment explores innovation and collaboration as the first stage in the Voltaire era of the Cardano roadmap. It involves investing actual ada with an initial fund worth $250,000 backing 11 proposals. Since then, it has become the largest fund of its kind, with total funds allocated worth $8m. And the community soon set up a Catalyst website.\nIn February, fun came to the Cardano blockchain when SingularityNet founder Ben Goertzel and Charles Hoskinson, IOG s co-founder, got together to explore the future of decentralization, artificial intelligence and social media. As we ll see later, it wasn t the end of the shenanigans as the pioneering AI and robotics company began moving its systems from Ethereum to Cardano.\nAll was not well elsewhere in the crypto world, however, with US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen warning that bitcoin was extremely inefficient . It was just the start of legislators in Washington and around the world digging into the crypto industry.\nMarch saw IOG bring out the hard fork combinator again. This may sound like a piece of farm machinery, but it s a clever way of taking the stress out of upgrading the blockchain. The Mary upgrade allowed Cardano to become a multi-asset platform. This means that anyone can now mint their own tokens, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without even needing a smart contract. Global commentators started to take real notice and the media rolled out its cliche-ridden Ethereum killer articles.\n**A corner of the $69m artwork: Christie's sold Mike Winkelmann's Everydays NFT as Beeple , his illustrations graced IOG blog posts for two years\nMike Winkelmann set the world alight when his NFT artwork, Everydays: the First 5000 Days, sold for $69,346,250 at Christie s. The auction propelled him into an exclusive club for the highest price paid for the work of a living artist, alongside Hockney, Hirst, Johns, and Koons. As Beeple , his illustrations graced IOG blog posts for two years.\nIn Germany, a computer science student thought he d have some fun with the new capabilities of Cardano. Alessandro Konrad switched from writing boring smart contracts in Ethereum. He launched his own stake pool with Berry NFTs as rewards for people delegating to his pool. Next up was SpaceBudz NFTs, which he created with a pal. In just two days, 10,000 of these sold at 50 ada each that s one way to pay your way through university!\n**Blockchain graffiti: an animated Leonardo DiCaprio raising a glass of champagne on the CardanoWall\nAs the month neared its end, the CardanoWall arrived. This tool helps people put messages on the blockchain as metadata. Most people treat this blockchain graffiti as fun, but be warned all human life is there.

It was soon followed by a view of farmland and, perhaps inevitably, a cat.\n**D-Day tweet: ada coin creation was handed over to more than a thousand stake pools on March 31\nThe last day of March was a landmark; it was D=0 Day. This was when IOG devolved block production totally to stake pool operators. Full decentralization had arrived.\nThe global buzz around Cardano grew louder with the announcement of an education program with 3,500 schools and five million pupils in April. Blockchains offer great promise in helping to achieve inclusive growth in African economies, and IOG aims to be at the forefront of this progress.\nBut school was definitely out when CardanoKidz hit the streets. These cartoon NFTs were based on IOHK staff heaven knows what posterity will make of them!\nIn May, the COP26 climate change conference was still six months away, but analysts and the media were latching on to Cardano as the environmentally friendly blockchain. Anthony Cuthbertson s profile, The green crypto that hopes to surpass the tech giants , started the trend.\nAnother form of media, Wikipedia, saw a record number of hits for its Cardano page, with 13,702 visits on May 15. A year before, there had been no Cardano page because editors pushing a blockchains are terrible agenda had taken it down in 2019 as not being notable . Such was the level of censorship that there was no reference to Cardano apart from a graphic showing it as one of the top 10 coins! A mention that Philip Wadler, one of the world s leading computer scientists, was working for IOHK was deleted as spam . Demand for a Cardano page was demonstrated when it had 5,195 visits the day after it reappeared in October 2020, surpassing Ethereum s 1,719. Yet, even now, the Cardano page is still under heavy sanctions and only a few Wikipedia editors can add to the copy.\nFun with AI was back when the Hoskinson and Goertzel show took to YouTube again for an update on moving to Cardano, and a chat with Grace, a cutting-edge healthcare robot. Grace asked about the IOG chief s pet giraffe and revealed that she didn t like technology!\nNervos, Nexo and Orion all announced projects with Cardano in June, developments with the Daedalus full-node wallet were discussed, and chief scientist Aggelos Kiayias set out the thinking on stabilizing transaction fees by establishing a peg to a basket of commodities or currencies.

So IOG teaming up with World Mobile in August to help bring cellular networks to some of the remotest regions of Africa should be a boon. More than a quarter of a million people have watched John O'Connor s video about IOG s activities in Africa. The mobile deal was followed by the European Business University of Luxembourg offering programming courses to African students.\nThe month produced a surprise when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin joined the Dogecoin Foundation board.\nThe prospect of decentralized finance (DeFi) clearly terrifies politicians in the US. The Financial Times pointed to the furore over imposing tax reporting rules on crypto brokers , a prospect buried in Joe Biden s $1tn infrastructure plan. One result was that it brought the fractious blockchain industry together.\n**Cardano's metaverse: 140,000 people logged into the summit, hosted on the back of an ocean-going mythical turtle\nSeptember was a busy month. El Salvador became the first country to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender. At IOG, the company ramped up for the Cardano Summit 2021 with 70 hours of presentations from 200 speakers. Over two days, 140,000 people logged into the event s metaverse, hosted on the back of an ocean-going mythical turtle. There was something for everyone, with more fun with robots and debate about the future of art among the technical and community talks. And during the summit the millionth Cardano NFT was minted. And last but not least, September saw the deployment of the Alonzo upgrade, bringing core Plutus smart contract capability to Cardano. Decentralized finance had arrived. As Tim Harrison put it at the time, it was a cause for celebration but really just the beginning of a journey that is now starting to gather pace.\nThe buzz around the summit and the Alonzo hard fork event attracted the editors at the Harvard International Review, which did a three-part interview in October with IOG s chief discussing Cardano, the developing world, the future of crypto, and financial regulation. Meanwhile, the strength of the collectibles market was shown when it was reported that the woolly-booted, axe-wielding SpaceBud #9936 had sold for 510,000 ada the first Cardano NFT to fetch the equivalent of a million US dollars. Plus we saw projects such as Meld gearing themselves up for launch with the first initial stake pool offerings.\nBison-herder Charles Hoskinson also took an IOG team to Africa in October and introduced us all to the smart cow effect.\nNovember saw Pool.pm s count of the number of NFTs minted on Cardano pass the two million mark and Andy Warhol came to the blockchain. Gallery owner Rudolf Budja launched a fractionalized NFT sale so people could own a piece of an Andy Warhol .\nEagle-eyed Cardano watchers spotted a Cardano logo on the proposed cover of The Economist magazine s The World Ahead: 2022. This annual analysis sees crypto as a battleground. Fighting for control are the decentralization pioneers building the technology, the big tech barons like Facebook and Google, and governments. The end of November saw the launch of the MuesliSwap decentralized exchange, a Cardano first generating as might be expected in such a febrile environment its share of bouquets and brickbats.\nDecember brought the launch of the P2P testnet, a milestone in Cardano s decentralization journey. Along with this came a release of the Plutus application backend, which will become a set of libraries to help speed development on Cardano. The number of Wikipedia page views for the Cardano page passed the million mark for the year.\n**SingularityNet ERC20 converter: a child explained how to convert the AI pioneer's tokens to Cardano\nIf all that s not intelligent enough for you, the much-anticipated testnet for an ERC20 converter to switch SingularityNet s internal AI token to Cardano sparked a lot of interest. And if it still all looks confusing, see the converter explained by a six-year-old. The past few weeks have also seen more projects start to launch on Cardano, from NFT marketplaces such as Tokhun, Cardahub and CNFT.io adding smart contract integration, to domain naming project Adahandle. And as the DeFi ecosystem starts to take off, in late December, an alliance was announced to help speed it on its way through standardisation and best practice in the shape of the Cardano DeFi Alliance.\nAs the year draws to a close, we invariably look to the past and the future, as The Economist has done. It's been an incredible year of growth with a community that continues to light the way. We ve also seen more than our fair share of opprobrium from critics and purveyors of fear, uncertainty and doubt the FUDsters'. Yet, still we have persevered and start the new year stronger and more resolute than ever.

    "prompt": "New certification levels for smart contracts on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nNiamh Ahern - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: October 25, 2021\nSummary:\nCertification will bring high assurance to the development of decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano\nArticle:\nHigh assurance is paramount when developing and working with smart contracts. You want to be confident that the source code is of high quality, that the contract is secure and will behave as it should, and that it utilizes good properties and behaviors in the process. Certification ensures that security checks are performed prior to any deployment and that smart contracts can be continually audited as they are updated. It provides benefits to both smart contract developers and end-users, helping protect user funds and project reputations alike from coding errors or exploits.\nAt September s Cardano Summit 2021, we laid out our plans for the introduction of new levels of certification for decentralized applications (DApps) running on Cardano. This certification program will provide levels of quality for DApps and their internal smart contacts.\nThis initiative has been led by Professor Simon Thompson, technical project director at IOG, and Shruti Appiah, head of product at IOG. It will help us comply with the best practices we ve seen around the industry. We are working with Runtime Verification, Tweag, Well-Typed, Certik, and others to roll out this new certification program that will link in with the new DApp Store, also unveiled in prototype form at the summit. This will be released in conjunction with the new light wallet.\nThere are three levels of certification, each of which is complementary to the others, rather than being progressive in terms of assurance and auditing purposes.\nThis certification level gives continual assurance about a range of properties for smart contracts. It covers the discovery of different types of issues or bugs and is characterized as low cost, low effort, accessible to everyone while providing a substantial level of assurance.\nIt can be applied repeatedly and automatically, so each time there is a release or a sub-release of an application, we can test to ensure that the application still has the properties that we expect.\nThis level involves looking at the technology and processes that led to it being produced. It is characterized by the fact that it involves a manual audit and verification of smart contracts within the DApp itself.\nThe testing is performed at a much more in-depth level and involves more manual effort that can address a DApp in its entirety, even if it is written in a variety of languages.\nThis level is more specialized where we aim to provide full assurance of critical aspects of applications through formal verification of smart contracts. Formal verification involves ensuring that a smart contract serves the specific business or technical requirements defined at the outset.\nCertification will ensure the correctness, compliance, and consistency of requirements by both application developers and auditors. It will also guarantee the absence of common security vulnerabilities and provide a level of robustness, reliability, and maintenance of DApps deployed on Cardano. While certification will be strongly encouraged and the store curated accordingly, it will not however be mandatory or act as any kind of gatekeeper thus maintaining a balance between the need for user assurance and decentralized principles.\nBy auditing the specifications and design and ideation phases, you can present evidence to the community and guarantee that things will work as expected. This evidence includes documentation of requirements to a detailed level, thereby creating a reference point for the future.\nWe plan to integrate this certification with the new DApp Store that we are building to provide cryptographically secure non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that give evidence of the levels of certification that we will guarantee. The DApp Store will be part of a light wallet that IO is developing, and users will be able to access the light wallet and DApp Store using a web browser, and in the store to view the certification status of each DApp as they browse through the categories and individual applications. Making the relevant certification status visible to users during the selection process will offer reassurance on quality and safety for users in their choice of DApps.\nProfessor Thompson says:\nWe want to build support from the industry for emerging standards of certification. In the longer term, we will work with our partners and others to articulate best practices, which may involve forming an umbrella industry body to define new standards and practices for this domain.\nWe also plan to work with our ecosystem of partners to support certification of the first DApps on Cardano; one of a number of DEXs looking to launch on Cardano this year SundaeSwap also announced their plans at the summit to certify.\nIt is still early days. There are some technical challenges that we are busy working through about how we support versioning of DApps, how they will be packaged, and how to make them available to automated tooling. However, we are very excited about this journey with our partners and the general community to deliver a secure platform and applications built on top of it.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Today will feel like a destination. Yet a new, exciting journey begins...?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nTim Harrison - VP Community & Ecosystem\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: September 12, 2021\nSummary:\nThe Alonzo upgrade is an epochal moment in the birth of a new ecosystem\nArticle:\nLater today, we'll deploy Plutus smart contract capabilities onto the Cardano mainnet via a hard fork combinator (HFC) protocol upgrade event.\nThe Alonzo upgrade will bring highly anticipated capabilities to Cardano through the integration of Plutus scripts onto the blockchain. These will allow the implementation of smart contracts on Cardano, enabling a host of new use cases for decentralized applications (DApps) for the very first time.\nIt s only just the beginning. But this is still a moment for celebration. As a community, we have been on an incredible journey together. Rightly, we should allow ourselves to acknowledge the tremendous efforts made by so many to get here. This will also be a time for reflection on the challenges we've collectively overcome.\nWhile we might allow ourselves some brief downtime, this is no moment to rest up. And there is certainly no room for hubris. This is where the mission truly begins as we the whole community start delivering on the vision we have all been working towards for so long. Building a decentralized system that extends economic identity and opportunity to everyone, everywhere.\nWhile many years of research and development have prepared the ground, it was the Byron reboot in March 2020 that truly laid the foundations for the network we have today, by providing a robust and scalable code base on which to build. In July the same year, the Shelley upgrade shifted Cardano from a federated model towards a decentralized one.\nSince the end of March 2021, when we adjusted the network decentralization parameter to D=0, every block has been produced by a decentralized network from a community of 2,868 stake pools.\nIt s a remarkable staking ecosystem that continues to grow rapidly. According to statistics from Cardano data aggregation tool Pooltool, the number of ada staking wallets today stands at 825,755. This represents an increase of 35 + since June. At the time of writing, the total ada delegated to stake pools is valued at $ 59.86 billion, accounting for 71.4 percent of total ada supply ($ 83.9b).\nMarch s Mary upgrade created a multi-asset network and introduced native tokens. As well as providing an alternative to the ERC20-type model, Mary released a Cambrian Explosion of creativity. With low minting and transaction fees and, uniquely, no need for smart contracts for Cardano NFTs, we have seen the blooming of an incredible NFT ecosystem. According to data from pool.pm (powered by Smaug pool), Cardano has seen 780,436 tokens minted to date and 19,419 policies. All without the need for smart contracts.\nThe Alonzo upgrade (named after the pioneering American mathematician Alonzo Church), will build on this success. Deployed using the same HFC technology used in previous upgrades, this will mark the beginning of a fresh period of rapid growth. By allowing Plutus scripts to be written and executed on-chain, we ll have the backbone for a new decentralized application platform, enabling numerous DApp and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases from simple swap type apps to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and more complex computational programs such as Oracles and crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoins.\nSo, we have one of the most decentralized, sustainable, robust, and advanced blockchain platforms in the world, run by a skilled community of stake pool operators (SPOs). We enjoy an informed and passionate community of delegators. We have a thriving NFT ecosystem, attracted by the ease and low-cost of minting. Oh, and a roadmap for future governance through Voltaire and ultimate scalability through Basho and Hydra scaling. The future is bright and stretches far; we ll continue to travel the long road together.\nAll the core building blocks are in place. Platform. Vision. Mission. Community. It is still very early days for smart contracts and DeFi, yet we have made great progress already.\nThousands of developers have been taking part in the Plutus Pioneers course, learning the fundamentals of Cardano s native development framework. Scores of projects have already started developing in Plutus and are at various stages of expertise and readiness. Hundreds of projects have been actively working on the various Cardano testnets and privately-hosted solutions. Some 150 projects are developing their ideas via Cardano s Project Catalyst innovation program, the world s largest decentralized innovation fund. In the latest round, 800 yes, 800 projects applied for $4m-worth of funding. With a treasury now worth well north of $1bn at today s values, and 33k+ members, the future for building on Cardano couldn t be brighter.\nFor a snapshot of just how many projects and organizations comprise the ecosystem, visit our Essential Cardano repo. Or check out the various excellent ecosystem maps (these are representative, though none are comprehensive) out there like those from the Cardians (see Figure 1). These don t represent what projects will be visible right away. But they offer a beautiful vista.\nFigure 1. Ecosystem map by @Cardians_\nWe look forward to seeing these projects evolve as they head towards deployment. Some are close to the launch pad, others further off. Following the release of our first full public testnet earlier this month, and now the mainnet, we expect to see many start to ramp up their development activity.\nLet us be clear. There will be bumps in the road. Early user experiences might not be perfect. Some early DApps will have issues. We'll see some great development teams and some poor ones. This is a permissionless, decentralized blockchain, so this is inevitable. And a few DApps may prove insecure. Cardano s secure layer 1 platform offers robustness and high assurance and Plutus is designed to minimize the potential for exploits. But poor coding practice can always introduce risks for DApp users. Inevitably too, we can expect bad actors looking to take advantage via hacks, exploits, and the likes.\nAs a community, we need to be vigilant as our ecosystem matures. In fact, we believe that to mature across the industry as a whole, certification needs to be taken more seriously. At the summit, we ll announce plans on how along with a number of strategic partners we ll be supporting the creation of new standards and solutions.\nAs ever, we encourage everyone to do your own research (DYOR). Look to your fellow community members for crowdsourced due diligence and provide your own contributions. Look for projects with a positive history of open and transparent communication, properly maintained social channels/websites, and technical track records. Be sensible out there, especially in these early days. Alongside confidence in DApp security and project intent, DApp discovery will also be key to the healthy growth of the Cardano ecosystem. So expect to hear more on that at the summit, too.\nThe summit will also be a time for celebration, although there will be those who will seek to sour this. While our community is always open to being challenged in good faith, we have grown too used to Twitter s and Reddit s fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) from the biased and the willfully ignorant. Every project receives its share of this toxicity, and a greater degree is inevitable around major releases.\nThis is a disappointing element of our immature industry. We need to do better if we want to accelerate wider adoption. The FUD has been particularly virulent this past week. For me, it's a daily part of the job. Fortunately, most of my colleagues focus on building and don't concern themselves too much with CryptoTwitter .\nWe shall see plenty more FUD and nonsense over the weeks ahead. Things will likely get uglier before they get better. Whatever. This will only strengthen our resolve to prove the naysayers wrong. We also have a vibrant and passionate community that never fails to support the project and respond with facts and courtesy. That continues to make everyone working on Cardano exceptionally proud. Thank you.\nLet s remain steadfast through the storm. And focus instead on a bright horizon. We expect to see the first simple smart contract scripts deployed on Cardano within hours of the HFC event. It will take a while longer for more sophisticated DApps to start rolling out via the public testnet. With hundreds of projects building behind the scenes, we expect to see projects deploy through September and October, and accelerate through Q4. Especially with launchpads, tools and frameworks, including the Plutus Application Backend (PAB), and community-created APIs becoming available.\nThere are high expectations resting on this upgrade. Some unreasonably so. Cardano watchers may be expecting a sophisticated ecosystem of consumer-ready DApps available immediately after the upgrade. Expectations need to be managed here. We should remember that another well-known blockchain project which launched in July 2015 had to wait over two years before its first DApp (something to do with cats?) gained real user traction.\nOver the coming months, we ll continue our cadence of fortnightly releases of new code, regular maintenance upgrades, and major HFC events each quarter. We shall continue to tune and optimize the platform, adjust performance, and refine pricing parameters as we track and monitor usage patterns. Only real usage will reveal how we need to adjust our flexible and scalable platform over the months of growth ahead. We shall also be looking to the growing developer community and the Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) process to bring further capability based on key requirements and needs.\nThe Alonzo HFC event will deploy Plutus 1.0, the core platform which itself will continue to evolve and bring more functionality over the coming months. Plutus is our native language, but of course, it is only the beginning here too. New bridges, sidechains, and other layer 2 solutions will bring in fresh options and an ever wider developer base. Future upgrades stemming from the work being done on Hydra will add further capability. Research papers like stablecoins, Babel coins, and stable fees will also in time start moving toward the prototype phase, bringing further innovation to the longer-term roadmap.\nSo, while we remain focused on continuing to research and develop longer-term utility for the platform, the ecosystem will evolve fast over the coming months. It's going to be quite a ride, with a huge amount of activity within the community.\nThe Alonzo upgrade is a transformational network upgrade that will catalyze a blossoming ecosystem of developers, creators, and innovators. Later this month, we ll have the Cardano summit. This week, we finalized the sessions. With over 100 sessions and more than 40 hours of content spread over multiple tracks across two full days, this will be the most significant event in Cardano s history. It will be a celebration across virtual worlds and real-life meetups, a showcase of where we are today, and a forum to talk about where we re heading. A reflection of a budding ecosystem that, while young, has always shown great maturity of purpose. And a platform for exciting new announcements.\nSo as we pass the epoch boundary today, let's take that moment. We can allow ourselves a celebratory whisky or two (even if it's just a cheeky splash in our morning coffee for our friends in Asia and the Southern hemisphere).\nLet s be proud of what we have achieved. But this is where the real work begins.\nLet s go.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Hydra Cardanos solution for ultimate Layer 2 scalability?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nSebastian Nagel - Software Engineering Lead\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: September 17, 2021\nSummary:\nScalability is baked into the Cardano development roadmap; enter Hydra\nArticle:\nThe Alonzo upgrade enables the creation of smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps), and other applications on top of Cardano.\nAlonzo marks a significant milestone in the Cardano journey, deploying base-level scripting capability that will, in turn, enable further innovation and network development. It also starts the process of transforming transactions & tokens-based blockchain into a dynamic confluence of creativity, financial inclusion, and decentralized development.\nAmong the most exciting of the fresh developments enabled by Alonzo is Hydra, a key layer 2 solution to further improve Cardano's scalability by layering a new protocol on top of the existing layer 1 blockchain.\nIn a blockchain network, a consensus algorithm creates a secure and trustless environment by ensuring agreement on transaction history. Cardano uses Ouroboros, an efficient proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, for this very purpose. But Cardano also, just like any permissionless blockchain, faces challenges when trying to scale to achieve the throughput required to support applications in the real world, including payment, identification, game, or mobile services. After all, the blockchain needs to reach global consensus on each and every transaction.\nCardano transactions incur fees. The people who run the network (in the case of Cardano, the stake pool operator community) need to be rewarded appropriately for the part they play, so fees need to be set at a sustainable level. Users want to pay fees they deem acceptable. In addition, the blockchain needs to be protected against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, for example. Fees can therefore not be set so low as to open up undue risk DoS events must be made prohibitively costly to a potential attacker. Storage is also a concern, as an ever-growing transaction history can lead to storage problems. Effectively, the most successful blockchains risk becoming victims of that very success.\nHydra is a layer 2 scalability solution that seeks to address all these concerns and aims to maximize throughput, minimize latency, incur low to no costs, and greatly reduce storage requirements.\nSo how does it do this? By providing a more efficient means of processing transactions off-chain for a set of users, while using the main-chain ledger as the secure settlement layer, Hydra keeps security guarantees while remaining loosely coupled to the main chain. Not requiring global consensus, it can adapt to a broad range of applications. For example, Hydra allows Tx fees and minimum UTXO Value to be configured as low as 1 or 2 lovelaces, critical to microtransactions and the use cases these unlock.\nMost importantly though, Hydra introduces the concept of isomorphic state channels: that is, to reuse the same ledger representation to yield uniform, off-chain ledger siblings, which we call Heads (hence the Hydra name, which references the mythological, multi-headed creature). Specifically for Cardano, this means that native assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Plutus scripting are available inside each Hydra Head. Isomorphism permits a natural extension of the system, rather than a bolted-on one.\nMany of the transactions currently handled by the main chain or application running on the main chain can benefit directly from Hydra because it understands just the same transaction formats and signatures. This greatly lowers the entry barrier to Hydra for existing and potential new customers, who can reuse Cardano's tried-and-tested infrastructure for building wallets and applications interacting with the layer 2 system. Also, a Hydra Head can be created without initial funds on a receiving party s side, which allows for a smooth user experience.\nWe have already implemented the basic Hydra Head protocol as a proof of concept hydra-node. A developer preview will be ready by the time of the upcoming Cardano Summit. This will enable developers (or anyone interested) to run one or more hydra-nodes online, opening a Hydra Head with a limited number of participants, and feeding transactions to it. Users can expect to see a working prototype over a dedicated testnet, plus early benchmarking figures and documentation in this GitHub repository. There likely will not be any user-facing components (wallets, user interface, etc.) available just yet.\nIt is also important to make a point about transactions per second (TPS), too often rather clumsily used as the sole measure of success when it comes to scalability. Some people tend to rate a network on the basis of its maximum throughput measured in throughput (TPS). While this is a reasonable measure for legacy systems where there is high predictability and conformity (e.g., the VISA network) it is a less useful metric for distributed systems. Instead, our initial focus is on latency (the time that elapses until a transaction is confirmed) as another, more practical way to measure the speed of blockchain transactions. On the mainnet, the minimum latency is 20 seconds (one block). This is the starting point. In a layer 2 system like Hydra, it is possible to achieve confirmation times of less than one second. Terms like one million TPS have been used before. It is a bold number, and while this remains an aspirational target, the ultimate goal of any system is the flexibility to grow capability with demand. Throughput measured in TPS per Hydra head is secondary and mostly limited by the available hardware. In principle, by adding increasing numbers of Hydra heads to the system, arbitrarily high throughput can be achieved by the system as a whole.\nIn the short term, we will keep developing the hydra-node and the Hydra Head protocol until it becomes a solid and stable foundation for the community (and us!) to build real-world applications. These new apps will benefit from fast settling and low-to-no-cost transactions. We are also actively developing other key features, including the support of multiple heads per node, persistence, and Head protocol extensions\nIn the medium term, say 6-12 months, progress will greatly depend on the results of our research and experimentation, plus feedback from the developer community. We are researching ways to interconnect multiple Hydra Heads to increase the reach of our layer 2 solution, for example, and also testing different methods to make it easier to integrate and use Hydra. One of the most exciting visions for the long term is the development of Virtual Heads by running the Hydra Head protocol inside Hydra Heads, thus fully utilizing the isomorphism of our Layer 2 solution. Herein lies true, theoretical limitless scalability.\nThe overarching concept for Hydra is the provision of a pioneering layer 2 scalability solution suitable for Cardano, a third-generation, UTXO-based blockchain capable of supporting smart contracts. Hydra will drive down costs while increasing throughput and maintaining security.\nHydra replicates the main chain's functionality while minimizing friction for users, but still allows the flexibility of having a different fee/cost structure and timing constraints on layer 2. Any successful ecosystem balances the needs of all users. We want this ecosystem to serve the needs of individual consumers, enterprises, professionals, and the growing list of DApps and their developers.\nWith the Alonzo hard fork, Cardano will start on a new journey as a smart contract platform, enabling technologies like Hydra, which in turn will dramatically improve Cardano s scalability, and thus further its adoption.\nAt the Cardano Summit 2021, taking place 25-26 September, we ll talk more about Hydra, its progress to date, and goals for the future.

    "prompt": "Cardano 101 What is a Cardano native token or asset? What it means for the USDA stablecoin?",
    "completion": "Cryptocurrencies (coins and tokens) are the backbone of any public or decentralized blockchain network.\nThese are the digital assets that give blockchain developers a way to provide needed services for users through DApps (decentralized applications) built on a particular blockchain. These days, there are popular DApps for DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens), among many others.\nA blockchain s native cryptocurrency/coin or other token types for DApps built on that particular blockchain are ultimately what highlight the useful benefits for its users.\nThese new types of digital assets also display versatile features.\nFrom fungible tokens that allow for decentralized voting and governance to NFTs that express the uniqueness of a particular digital creation, cryptocurrencies can represent almost anything in a digital format.\nTokens are what allow DEXs (decentralized exchanges), borrowing & lending DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and other DApps built on the Cardano blockchain to deliver unique value.\nBut not all cryptocurrencies and their blockchains are identical.\nThere are different ways to technically design tokens and the Cardano blockchain has developed a unique approach for tokens based on its network; these tokens are also considered native to the underlying Cardano blockchain protocol.\nLet s dig deeper into what this means and its implications, especially for $USDA, the first USD-backed stablecoin for the Cardano ecosystem.\nMost blockchains use smart contracts to create tokens for projects built on their blockchains.\nThis means that a public blockchain s ledger or network is unaware of what tokens are. Instead, it only processes the computations of the smart contracts when these are called upon.\nIn this context, the balance displayed by a particular crypto wallet is not something the blockchain network is tracking.\nThe smart contract that created the tokens tracks the balance, and the underlying blockchain in general doesn t understand what any of these assets are.\nIt looks something like this:\nSource: https://medium.com/icovo/non-programmers-guide-to-issue-tokens-9469eb55dade\nIn the smart contract of a token, there is a data structure called a map.\nIn it, two pairs of information are linked together, as one or the key is used to retrieve the other, which can only correspond to a unique key.\nSo, the smart contract tracks a wallet address as the key while the balance is the piece of information tied to the key.\nThe blockchain network doesn t see the inside of the smart contract and only computes the results of the users interacting with functions in the smart contract.\nIn short, the blockchain network doesn t understand what tokens are.\nA different approach to allow tokens to exist in a decentralized blockchain network is to make them native.\nIn this case, the blockchain itself has a concept, and functions to mint other assets besides the main underlying cryptocurrency of the blockchain.\nThis type of blockchain is also called multi-asset because of this design feature.\nIn a blockchain with native tokens, the underlying blockchain network itself tracks the balances and transfers of the different token types built on its network.\nThe blockchain can understand the other tokens built or issued on its network. When one is sent to another wallet address, the record of that transaction is part of the history of the blockchain network itself.\nFor this reason, native tokens can move and behave basically in all the same ways the main cryptocurrency of the network does.\nAdditionally, the blockchain itself can understand what these other tokens moving around are, so their behavior is predictable when it comes to the fee of the transaction and the way they modify the state of the blockchain network.\n$USDA is the first fiat-backed stablecoin in the Cardano ecosystem.\nTo understand the beneficial effects of this design choice, let s use the example of $USDA, the first USD-backed Cardano stablecoin scheduled to launch in Q1 2023.\nUSDA will be a native token to the Cardano blockchain that is backed 1:1 by real-world reserves. It s meant to be a stable asset that can unlock fast global transactions without legacy banking and payment infrastructure delays.\nRead more: 5 stablecoin use cases for the Cardano community\nIn blockchains that use smart contracts to represent tokens, users are at the mercy of the fee costs of the network. If a network is highly congested, the fees for using the blockchain will climb and price out more and more users further reducing the use cases of the network and removing active users.\nThis is particularly dangerous for stablecoins. A stable asset losses its role as a means of payment the more expensive it is to transfer. If a user has to pay for a service costing 50 $USDA, but the transaction fee itself costs 29 dollars, the user would most likely not make such a transaction.\nBut in the case of $USDA, it is a native asset.\nThis means that there is no need to compute a smart contract when transferring it. For this reason, the fee for that transaction is always stable and predictable which means that users can move small amounts of USDA to pay for things, and developers don t have to worry about expensive fees reducing its utility.\nSmart contracts can also be malicious or poorly secured, introducing risks for developers and users. The code of a smart contract is fully mutable which makes it a big source for possible attacks or exploits. For DApps that use stablecoins, this is a major risk that again reduces the utility of a stablecoin.\nAs a native asset, $USDA doesn t require a smart contract. The attack surface is vastly reduced when the Cardano blockchain understands what tokens and other assets are. The security of the base protocol is extended to the tokens, so users can be sure that $USDA is secure, while developers can model for its predictable behavior.\nNative tokens were a major design choice for Cardano and one of its strongest features in addition to its eco-friendly technology. This required some major research considerations, as other multi-asset ledgers were not in existence when Cardano was in development.\nBut the advantages native tokens bring are clear and their increased utility can be seen in how they make the USDA stablecoin a better asset, especially for Cardano-based DApps and ada holders.\nUSDA, Cardano s first USD-backed stablecoin for the ecosystem, is scheduled to launch in early 2023 and bring value to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of decentralized applications.\nIt will be the first product from the Anzens suite of fintech products from EMURGO.\nJoin the waitlist now at https://www.anzens.com to be ready for $USDA.\nThis article originally appears here: https://emurgo.io/cardano-101-what-is-a-cardano-native-token-usda-stablecoin/\nAbout USDA\nOfficial Homepage: anzens.com\nTwitter: @AnzensOfficial\nAbout EMURGO\nOfficial Homepage: emurgo.io\nTwitter (Global): @EMURGO_io\nYouTube: EMURGO channel\nDiscord: EMURGO Community\nFacebook: @EMURGO.io\nInstagram: @EMURGO_io\nLinkedIn: @EMURGO_io\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "What is Cardano for newcomers?",
    "completion": "Cardano is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that was developed and launched in 2017 by Input Output Global (IOG) - formerly Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) - a blockchain research and development company. The platform was created to address some of the scalability, security, and interoperability issues that plague many other blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nOne of the key features of Cardano is its use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more energy-efficient and secure than the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm used by Bitcoin and other chains. With PoS, the chance of a node being selected to validate a block is proportional to the amount of Cardano tokens (ada) that the node holds. This means that, instead of expending energy to solve complex mathematical problems like with PoW, nodes on the Cardano network simply need to hold a stake of ada to participate in the consensus process.\nCardano also utilizes a multi-layer architecture, with a separate layer for smart contracts and another for decentralized applications (DApps). This design allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as different parts of the platform can be updated and improved independently of each other.\nIn addition to its technical innovations, Cardano has a strong focus on security and governance. The platform uses a formal verification process to mathematically prove the correctness of its code, which helps to reduce the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities. Cardano also has a decentralized decision-making process through which stakeholders can propose and vote on changes to the network.\nOne of the main goals of Cardano is to enable the development of financial applications for underserved populations in developing countries. To this end, the Cardano Foundation, a non-profit organization that oversees the development of the platform, has partnered with organizations such as the World Bank and the Ethiopian Government to explore the use of Cardano for financial inclusion initiatives.\nOverall, Cardano is a promising blockchain platform that has the potential to address many of the challenges faced by other networks. Its use of a PoS consensus algorithm, multi-layer architecture, and focus on security and governance make it an interesting choice for developers and organizations looking to build DApps.\nNow that you know the basics about Cardano, you definitely need to use Cardano explorer to learn about its ecosystem.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Calculating the number of projects building on Cardano?",
    "completion": "The Cardano ecosystem has seen significant growth over the past year, with growing numbers of projects launched and developers building on Cardano. Knowing what's going on in the ecosystem is key to building understanding - of the successes, the pain points and how we can all contribute to its further growth. The Community & Ecosystem Team at Input Output Global, Inc. (IOG) is committed to building relationships with projects and developers in the ecosystem, so the team would want to know about as many projects building on Cardano as possible - from the very early stages right through launch and beyond.\nBut where are these projects found, and how are they measured? Read on...\nWhat is a \"project\"?\nYou'll often see IOG refer to the number of projects building on Cardano - in our Essential Cardano development updates, social media posts, and our Essential Cardano Guide to the Ecosystem report. In this context, a project is defined as a product, service, or brand that's building something on or for Cardano - so, for example, a decentralized exchange (DEX), a digital wallet, an NFT marketplace, an NFT minting service, a project selling NFTs to fund a real-world initiative, a Cardano developer tool, or a data explorer.\nDiscovery and evaluation\nIOG will often hear about a new project via social media, whether that's because someone directly mentions them, or they post an announcement.\nAfter hearing about a project, IOG does some preliminary checks, including but not limited to:\nDo they have a website?\nWhat are they building?\nDoes their website state they are building on Cardano?*\nDo they mention Cardano on social media? How often? How recently?\nDo they have a Discord server?**\nWhat about GitHub repos?\nHave they published a white paper?\nAre they listed on any community sites such as Cardano Cube or Built on Cardano? Or on DApp Radar or DAppsOnCardano?\nDo they respond to outreach? Contacting projects is part of the process - for example, for the soon to be published Essential Cardano Guide to the Ecosystem, IOG reached out to over 150 separate projects to verify details.\nYou d think this was a given! You d be surprised how many don t mention it.\nMembers of our team join a LOT of Discord servers.\nNext, IOG performs some basic checks for red flags, such as:\nIs their website very vague with no team or contact information?\nDo they have lots of PR but almost no social media engagement or community buzz?\nWhat are people saying about them on social media?\nHave they been reported to the Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau?\nIs there a thread about them in the Report A Scam part of the Cardano Forum?\nSome of these are obvious, some not so much. If a project appears to be a scam, or if there is little to no evidence of work actually being done, IOG will record that data separately i.e. it won't be included in our total.\nIn order to be counted in our data, a project would need to pass more than half of the basic checks we perform. Some of these checks carry more weight than others - for example, a website stating that a project is building on Cardano is a helpful clue, but a whitepaper gives us more confidence, and a GitHub repo where we can see the code would carry more weight again. On the red flags side, if a project presents any of the issues on our list we would usually move them out of our main dataset, unless the only issue is a lack of team or contact info.\nMonitoring and updates\nIf these basic checks show that a project appears to be actively developing, building, or delivering their service or product on Cardano and seems to be genuine, it will be added to our data. That doesn't mean it'll be there forever - IOG regularly checks and updates the data to remove any abandoned projects, rug pulls, or even - gasp! - projects that end up building on another blockchain (there aren't many, but it happens). IOG also updates projects as new information emerges. This is a constant ongoing process!\nSometimes, there won't be enough information available to determine whether a project is building on Cardano or not. In that case, it s not added to these numbers until IOG verifies that the project is (or claims to be) building on Cardano.\nWhere does this data come from?\nSeveral sources:\nProjects IOG has had contact with: they've attended an event, or IOG has held calls or meetings with them. These tend to be well established projects; if that relationship exists already, IOG is in a strong position to find out more about them.\nCatalyst-funded projects. Not all of them - they need to meet the above definitions.\nProjects IOG has discovered through research, mostly originating on social media. These are the projects about which IOG knows the least, and they're often the most exciting to discover.\nWhat isn't a \"project\"?\nConcepts or tasks are not projects, for example. So a Catalyst proposal to translate all of Charles' videos into another language? Super cool! But we wouldn't include that in this data. What about a plan for a project that might happen in the future, but is just an idea right now? IOG will keep track of it, but it won't be included in this data until the team identifies that work has commenced. Obviously we can't always be certain of this - unless code is open source there's always got to be a level of trust that people are doing what they say they're doing - but this comes back to the checklists and using other signals to evaluate that, on balance, a project appears to be building.\nSo is this all of the projects?\nNo! New projects appear all the time.\nHow can I tell you about a project?\nYou can submit it to the Essential Cardano list on GitHub or email community@iohk.io with Guide to the Ecosystem as the subject.\nHow can I get my hands on this Essential Cardano Guide to the Ecosystem you mention?\nSign up here to be notified when it s published or updated, and to receive regular updates on the evolving ecosystem.\nWith such a rapidly growing ecosystem, it is hard to keep up. Our research cannot hope to be comprehensive, but we work hard to ensure it is accurate and useful. We remain committed to doing what we can alongside other valuable community sites like Building on Cardano, Cardano Cube , Built On Cardano and others to deliver useful data for the community and feed the growing appetite for all things Cardano.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Getting to a FutureReady Yoroi Wallet Part 1?",
    "completion": "Yoroi Wallet is one of the most important products EMURGO has built.\nOur cryptocurrency light wallet is the gateway to all other products, services, and features that we are planning including an especially exciting launch announcement at Cardano Summit 2022.\nHowever, we do acknowledge that for some time, the performance of our wallet has left a lot to be desired and we have taken the last few months to address these issues.\nNow that the first phase of Yoroi s performance improvement plan is being put into action and a major improvement is scheduled to be released in the coming weeks, we would like to take a moment to explain what challenges we faced as well as our plan going forward to build a better Yoroi.\nSo as we lay out our phased approach below for getting to a Future-Ready Yoroi, keep in mind that this is a journey, with several stages involved but one that we are committed to taking.\nLet s start with some history, as EMURGO has gone through our fair share of challenges and successes over the past few years, and it helps to put where we are in context.\nWe ve been developing Yoroi Wallet since 2018. Our team had grown from 5 developers to 11 by 2020.\nThen right as Cardano s user base started to rapidly grow, we experienced unfortunate changes in management and other difficulties.\nWe rushed to keep up with the demand and in that rush, we went down some wrong paths from a technical architecture perspective.\nWith new leadership this year, a seasoned Chief Technology Officer, and a dedicated technical team now on board, we ve been able to reimagine and carefully re-engineer our product architecture, user experience, and development process.\nThe best way to lay out our approach is to use a Good-Better-Best (G-B-B) framework.\nIt s a practical framework for Yoroi s improvement progression and how we get to a future-ready Yoroi Wallet.\nIn Part 1 of our three-part series, we will cover Yoroi Good State.\nIn the following parts, we will discuss Yoroi Better State, and how we get to a Yoroi Future-Ready Best State. There s a lot to cover, so let s get started.\nDecoupled vs. monolithic architecture: In the world of software, there are two types of architecture. A monolithic architecture acts and serves as a single system with components coupled together. In a decoupled software architecture, components of the system are built separately but integrated with well-defined interfaces so that a change in one component s codebase does not impact the other. It also means that while one team is fixing one part of the app, another team can be improving another part without blocking each other.\nA decoupled architecture gives Yoroi several benefits: A decoupled architecture allows developers to deploy new code for each component independently without needing to update the entire code base. This makes Yoroi easier to develop, test, and maintain, resulting in:\nBetter user experience due to faster signing and processing of transactions\nImprovements in time to delivery of new features and UX improvements that the community wants\nFreedom and flexibility to scale business logic independently from frontend UI\nHow we Achieved a Decoupled Architecture Moving Yoroi s business logic from the front end and back end: Keeping the front end free of business logic is a good software engineering practice. When too much data and business logic are processed, it impacts the performance of the wallet. So moving business logic from the front end to the back end improves the performance and maintainability of the wallet and allows us to better handle Yoroi user requests.\nKnowing that moving the business logic and related data processing to the backend will ultimately provide the best user experience, we achieved further performance improvements because:\nDue to the growth of transactions on Cardano, Yoroi Wallet no longer relies on transactions from the blockchain to generate UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs). We have developed an entirely new service to provide the UTXOs efficiently.\nThe new UTXO service also provides wallet assets, including tokens, NFTs, and user balances.\nYoroi Then: Since 2018, Yoroi has been using PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database, for its data management. Relational databases like PostgreSQL utilize tables and indexing for data management. This makes PostgreSQL great for handling small to medium-sized information but has query limitations as the size and interconnectedness of the blockchain data increases.\nYoroi Now: As part of our performance review, we looked into other options for managing the various data gathered from the Cardano Blockchain and from Yoroi Wallet itself. We re now in the process of our switch from PostgreSQL to a Graph database which is great news for Yoroi users, as they will see significant performance upgrades when fetching data.\nOur Yoroi users were commonly experiencing slow wallet syncing and other inconvenient performance issues. Sometimes this was caused by congestion and overload to our backend servers. To solve this, we ve made a sizable investment to upgrade servers to enterprise-grade. We have added servers with enhanced memory and increased processing power to operate well during peak loads. This infrastructure enhancement together with software architecture changes has resulted in faster transactions and sync times.\nIn addition, we are adding management capabilities to our data centers to monitor the health of our systems and respond to issues before they impact our users. Our new enterprise-grade infrastructure allows us to set a threshold for the amount of data we can handle, and when it goes over this limit or when something fails, we are notified automatically. This lets us scale up and down the infrastructure, or take other corrective measures, as needed.\nThere are many developments in Yoroi s Good State that are not covered in depth here, but they are no less important. One example is internal control process improvements, a key part of the team s continuous process improvement initiative. Another example is the change in our testing process including a new effort to involve the Cardano community in testing wireframes.\nIn sum, the primary objective of Yoroi Good State is to lay the foundation for sustainable growth as Cardano adoption increases. As the number of users and transactions on Cardano increases so will Yoroi Wallet s relative performance.\nStay tuned for Part 2 of the Getting to a Future-Ready Yoroi Wallet series where we discuss EMURGO s New Database Sync: What is it, How it Performs Better, and Why it Matters.\nClick here to download Yoroi Wallet\nYoroi is an open-source and the first light wallet built for Cardano ada users to be your gateway to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of dApps including DeFi and NFTs.\nAs a self-custodial wallet, the user always has complete control over their Cardano ada and can stake and unstake as they wish.\nEMURGO and Yoroi Wallet would also love to hear back from the community. We have created a Yoroi community feedback form to gather ideas and ways to improve the Yoroi user experience.\nPlease find the Yoroi community feedback form here.\nIf you need further assistance, contact Yoroi s customer help desk here and a customer support specialist shall respond within 24 hours.\nAuthored by: Keisha Dwyer\nAcknowledgments: Vijay (CTO), Juliano Lazzarotto, Tyler Wales\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nYoroi Twitter: @YoroiWallet\nOfficial Website: yoroi-wallet.com\nAbout EMURGO\nOfficial Homepage: emurgo.io\nTwitter (Global): @EMURGO_io\nYouTube: EMURGO channel\nDiscord: EMURGO Community\nFacebook: @EMURGO.io\nInstagram: @EMURGO_io\nLinkedIn: @EMURGO_io\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Top three reasons the Cardano blockchain may need a stablecoin backed by dollars?",
    "completion": "Authored by: Keisha Dwyer - EMURGO\nAcknowledgments: Tyler Wales - EMURGO\nOriginally published on emurgo.io: October 24, 2022\nThe Cardano blockchain is an open-source and decentralized blockchain platform driven by a research-first approach. Cardano is considered to be one of the biggest environmentally-friendly blockchain networks in the industry due to its algorithm.\nAda, the native cryptocurrency to Cardano, was developed to provide permissionless financial access to anyone and everyone. To date, there are more than 3.9 million active ADA wallet addresses signaling its global reach. However, the price volatility of ADA, and other cryptocurrencies in general, potentially restricts users from taking full advantage of the permissionless and global nature of Cardano, such as not being able to use crypto assets as a store of value or medium of exchange.\nSome people believe that the solution to this problem is stablecoins, digital currencies that are pegged to a US dollar or other fiat currency. Because stablecoins are backed by a safe asset, like the dollar, this should contrast cryptocurrencies that aren t backed by anything and lead to wild price fluctuations.\nFor more on stablecoins and the different stablecoin approaches see Stablecoins: What Are They, and How Do They Work?\nFor this blog, we ll focus on stablecoins backed by dollars and provide reasons why Cardano may need this stablecoin approach. But first, a little more on stablecoins backed by dollars, otherwise known as fiat collateralized stablecoins.\nAccording to Cardano Clan, with a market cap of $130B+, stablecoins backed by dollars are the most dominantly-used stablecoins making up almost 90 of the existing stablecoins in the market today. Some of the most popular stablecoins of this type are Tether tokens (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Binance USD (BUSD). Fiat-collateralized stablecoins are fully backed by cash or cash equivalents and maintained by centralized issuers like Tether or Circle. These issuers are audited regularly to ensure the integrity of the reserves.\nAs smart contracts and DeFi on Cardano grows, a stablecoin backed by dollars could be well suited to become one of the most important tools for our ecosystem. Let s unpack some of the reasons why.\nNot all stablecoin designs are made equal. A fiat-backed stablecoin losing its peg has a higher probability of returning 1:1 to its paired asset. A Cardano stablecoin backed by dollars can be said to be a more reliable approach than an algorithmic design, which is not backed by real-world assets. The integrity of a stablecoin approach backed by dollar reserves could create a strong price stability assurance for the Cardano community and improve Cardano investor confidence. This is especially true during periods of sudden volatility. Temporary price deviations from the peg during extreme market downturns would spook the Cardano investor less since a stablecoin backed by dollars would in theory come back to the peg once the market stabilizes.\nOne main goal of stablecoins on Cardano is to facilitate trades. A USD-denominated stablecoin that could maintain its peg better - on demand - would offer a better long-term approach to stability and store of value for the Cardano ecosystem. One result would be the unlocking of even more reliable financial services to the Cardano ecosystem such as stable lending and swapping.\nBecause every approach has strengths and weaknesses, maintaining a balance towards stablecoin approaches is key. When choosing a stablecoin for the Cardano ecosystem, it is important to consider vulnerabilities and looming global stablecoin regulation. The LUNA collapse in May 2022 laid the groundwork for stricter regulation of algorithmic stablecoins and the future of this approach is uncertain, particularly in the United States. For an algorithmic stablecoin on Cardano like Djed, several countries, including the USA, will likely not have access to its platform at launch.\nHave more reasons why a Cardano stablecoin backed by dollars would be great for the ecosystem?

    "prompt": "Astarter introducing a framework for merge staking protocol rewards?",
    "completion": "There are many reasons for Astarter to develop a two-stage ISPO. For instance, to incentivize both ada and AA staking for Cardano and Astarter ecosystems, incentive reward for participation in the ecosystems, and to create an innovative way to fundraise and invest in projects with minimal risk.\nAs an ISPO distribution method, MSP distributes project tokens in a more targeted way than any other ISPO while at the same time addressing issues relating to value addition and utility.\nThe first stage of the Astarter ISPO that enables the community to accumulate an assignment of native AA tokens from delegating ada to Astarter AA1 Stake pool is underway. The accumulated AA tokens may be utilized in the second stage of the ISPO, Merge Staking.\nThis article focuses primarily on the second stage of Astarter ISPO, Merge Staking Protocol (MSP) rewards. To read more about the first stage of the ISPO, follow this link.\nAA Tokenomics\nAA token is the heart of Astarter, which acts as a governance token and native utility token for the community and project infrastructure.\nAA tokens staked within the Astarter staking ecosystem can contribute towards merge-staking rewards in the second stage of the ISPO (Merge Staking Protocol). The Astarter staking ecosystem is multifaceted with elements and functions that include Launchpad tier-level access, Astarter Decentralised Exchange (ADEX) AMM liquidity provisions, Money Market yield-generating lending, and collateralized borrowing.\nAt the same time, the AA token is also the reward payment token of Astarter, AA1 pool. The rewards to users participating in Astarter ISPO stage 1 are in the form of AA tokens. For more on Astarter Tokenomics.\nMerge Staking Protocol\nIn addition to the Astarter ISPO AA1 stake pool, we also introduced two MSP programs, partner and associate, for SPOs to participate in the second stage. The difference between these two programs is; that partner MSP pools hold an allocated AA and earn MSP partner rewards. The initial number of associate and partner pool slots is limited to allow the protocol to scale. The reward structure for partner pools is discussed in greater detail later in a follow-up the article.\nMerge Staking Protocol Rewards\nIn regards to the second stage of the ISPO Merge Staking Protocol rewards, there is a two-step process to earning AA through Merge Staking as follows;\nDelegation of ada to Astarter AA1 or an MSP pool, This is ada delegated to earn Cardano protocol staking rewards or other rewards depending on the chosen pool.\nStaking AA in the Astarter staking ecosystem, the Astarter staking ecosystem is multifaceted in that it has different rewards and incentives specific to each core product which adds to the AA token utility.\nThe combination of 1) ada delegated and 2) AA Staked in the steps above is a combined requirement for Merge Staking AA rewards. Merge staking AA rewards come on top of any delegation or staking reward in 1 and 2 above.\nWhile the exact formula is not as simple as ada Delegation + AA Stake, the combination of the two produces a computation of a virtual stake.\nAvgStake x N = Virtual Stake\nAvgStake x N = Virtual Stake\nAvgStake is the average amount of AA the user has staked within the Astarter ecosystem.\nAvgStake\nN is the sum of multipliers and includes a merge staking multiplier incremental to the combined ada delegation to Astarter AA1 or an MSP pool and AA stake within the Astarter ecosystem.\nN\nThis adaptive approach allows for additional multipliers to increase the Virtual Stake and subsequent AA rewards earned; for example, early participation, duration, NFT, or Multi Token multipliers.\nExample Rewards\nData modeling potential rewards under different scenarios based on the framework outlined in this article produce some interesting results. While still in development and subject to change the following example demonstrates potential rewards.\nThe amount of AA distributed per epoch adjusts depending on the sum of all Virtual Stakes (of all participants) so that more participants and AA staked can result in balanced rewards over time. There is a forecast of between 30 300 expected APR for Merge Staking AA.\nFor every participant, the average AA staked in the Astarter ecosystem multiplied by the sum of all multipliers will give a virtual stake:\nAvgAAStaked * SUM(Multipliers)= Virtual Stake\nAvgAAStaked * SUM(Multipliers)= Virtual Stake\nTo calculate participant AA rewards per epoch during stage 2 Merge Staking. The system divides the Virtual Stake by the sum of all Virtual Stakes (of all participants) and multiplies each share by the amount of AA distributed each epoch.\nAA rewards = Virtual Stake / Sum(All Virtual Staked) * AA rewards per epoch\nAA rewards = Virtual Stake / Sum(All Virtual Staked) * AA rewards per epoch\nExample Scenario\nAn early participant delegating 1000 ada to Astarter AA1 or an MSP pool has collected an AWL NFT and holds it in the same delegating wallet. When merge staking begins, the participant stakes 500 AA in the Astarter staking ecosystem.\nThe 500 AA stake multiplied by 2.274 (the sum of multipliers) gives a Virtual Stake of 1,137\nThere is a total Virtual Stake by all users of 1,534,222\nThe MSP reward pot for the epoch is 12,153 AA\n1,137 divided by 1,534.222 Multiplied by 12,153 9.007 AA rewards (132 APR)\nIntroduction to Merge Staking Protocol multipliers\nMultipliers determine the amount of virtual stake through simple multiplication. Therefore the greater the number of multipliers, the greater the virtual stake and subsequent token rewards.\nThe maximum bonus multiplier, at least for now, is four and includes the following multipliers;\nBasic Bonus Multiplier\nMerge Stake Multiplier\nEarly Bird Multiplier\nNFTs Held Multiplier\nBasic Bonus Multiplier\nThis Multiplier gets granted to all Merge Skating participants delegating ada to an MSP pool and Staking AA in the Astarter staking ecosystem.\nMerge Staking multiplier\nThe Merge Staking multiplier is relative to the combined ada/AA stake. Delegated ada and staked AA thresholds are combined to achieve the merge staking multiplier.\nAfter the stage 2 Merge Staking starts, participants will earn MSP AA rewards based on the amount of ada delegation to Astarter AA1 or a participating MSP Pool and the amount of AA staked in the Astarter staking ecosystem.\nMore ada delegated to Astarter AA1 or an MSP pool, and the more AA staked to the Astarter ecosystem, will increase the Merge Staking multiplier.\nEarlybird Multiplier\nThe first early participation bonus applies to delegators participating from epoch 366 369 with a sustained average delegation over a specific time after stage 2 Merge Staking starts.\nMore ada delegated to Astarter AA1 or our MSP pools during a period will give a higher Earlybird multiplier.\nNFT Multipliers\nAstarter AWLs NFT series is packed with ISPO and Merge Staking Protocol utility, and while still being developed, the basic principle of this utility is thus;\nHolding Astarter NFTs in the same wallet that is delegating ada to Astarter AA1 or an MSP pool and Staking AA in the Astarter ecosystem will result in an NFT multiplier. NFT Multipliers are specific to Astarter NFT collections and are awarded based on the number of NFTs held up to a maximum.\nTo conclude this article with a heads up on the first NFT multiplier coming to the Astarter ISPO AA1 pool soon! Learn how to participate in the Astarter ISPO stage 1 delegating ada before epoch 380!\nThank you for reading.\nAstarter Social Links\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Medium | YouTube\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "What is SECP and how it drives crosschain development on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Cryptography plays an integral role in the blockchain space, ensuring trust and security between network participants.\nDApp developers can use cryptographic primitives as the building blocks to create secure transactions containing sensitive data, develop custom encryption and decryption algorithms, and validate such by using digital signatures.\nIn recent decades, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) has become the de facto primitive for developing cryptographic protocols and secure applications. ECC provides the same level of security as other mechanisms while using shorter keys and signatures.\nWhat is SECP?\nSECP, or SECP256k1 in particular, is the name of the elliptic curve. Many blockchains (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin) use this curve to implement public key cryptography, which uses a key pair (public and private keys) to validate transaction signatures.\nExamples of SECP include the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr signatures. These allow users to verify the integrity of specific signed hashed data. ECDSA and Schnorr signature algorithms work with the SECP256k1 curve in many blockchains.\nCardano uses the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) with elliptic curve25519 as its native signature algorithm.\nThis means that Plutus DApp developers who want to work with other blockchains and need to validate ECDSA and Schnorr signatures would have to spend time, effort, and funds to implement such SECP elliptic curves in Plutus. Additionally, this considerably increases potential security risks. Since ECDSA and Schnorr aren t native to Cardano, such operations would be more expensive and time-consuming unless provided as built-in functions.\nAdding new built-in functions to Plutus\nTo enable building cross-chain applications efficiently, Input Output Global (IOG) is adding new built-in functions to support ECDSA and Schnorr signatures along with Cardano s native signature.\nThese built-in functions will become native to Cardano, and since they will be implemented and audited by experts, they will provide the highest level of security. This will allow any Plutus DApp developer to widen the choice of multi-signature or threshold signature design to use. In particular, Schnorr-based designs are well understood and widely used by the DApp community.\nCIP-49 provides a more in-depth oversight of the motivation and specification for the new implementation of built-in functions. These changes affect the Plutus interpreter, so implementation will require a hard fork combinator event. To find out more about this requirement, read CIP implementation specifics.\nF igure 1. How SECP cryptographic primitives will work on Cardano\nAfter the new cryptographic primitives implementation, Plutus will be able to easily verify transactions from other blockchains using ECDSA and Schnorr standards. For example, Plutus will be able to natively verify signatures generated in EVM sidechains, which will improve the developer experience in terms of process simplicity, cost, and advanced security.\nCommunity feedback indicated how the addition of new cryptographic primitives would improve the process of secure and efficient cross-chain DApp development on Cardano. Learning from the Vasil upgrade, IOG teams have done a lot of work refining the release process and are utilizing this for the SECP release. The community is already helping to test this new functionality, which will initially be deployed on the Cardano devnet. From that point, the functionality will undergo continuous testing on preview and pre-production environments. Once the community is comfortable that test benchmarks have been achieved and critical indicators have been met, IOG will propose a date of mainnet deployment via a hard fork combinator event.\nTo stay abreast of developments, please join IOG s developer Discord channels.\nI d like to thank Inigo Querejeta Azurmendi, Nigel Hemsley, and Mark Irwin for their input and support in preparing this blog post.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Testing Plutus Smart Contracts 33?",
    "completion": "You can check Part 1 and Part 2 under these links:\nTesting Plutus Smart Contracts (1/3)\nTesting Plutus Smart Contracts (2/3)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo guarantee secure and high-quality smart contracts, rigorous testing strategies should be implemented. These will significantly differ from standard testing techniques typically used in low-risk web 2 applications.\nTesting in Plutus has been thoroughly covered in the 8th lecture of the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nMy background, which is largely in software quality in test automation, means I was ecstatic to discover blockchain testing concepts, especially with Plutus.\nIn three Plutus Testing-related articles, we will go over special techniques on how to test Plutus smart contracts using the emulator trace, calculate test coverage, the notion of optics and lenses, and Property-Based Testing.\nIn the last article, we covered the following concepts:\nAssertions\nEmulator Trace-Based Tests\nCode Coverage\nOptics and Lenses in Haskell\nIn this article, we will present the concept of Property Based Testing.\nThe concept of property-based testing already exists in some libraries of other mainstream programming languages. However, this approach originally came from Haskell.\nUnit testing is more popular than property-based testing. But we should note that property-based testing both subsumes and includes unit testing.\nVarious libraries in Haskell implement this approach. Regardless, the most important library in Haskell for property-based testing is the Quick Check Library.\nTo discuss our property-based testing goal, we should go over how we generally write tests.\nIn practice, tests comprise test steps and test assertions (sometimes called properties). So, we must feed our tests with test data before executing them, trying to break our pre-defined assertions.\nWe feed our tests with a few test data we manually pre-define in the unit testing approach.\nIn property-based testing, it is not our task to choose the test data. The power of this approach resides in how our library will be responsible for the task of automatically generating random test data.\nOnce the assertion (property) goes unmet met, the framework doesn t deliver the counter-example directly. Instead, it tries to simplify the counter-example and deliver the simplest version. This concept is known as shrink.\nBut one of the main challenges of property-based testing is its inability to test non-pure function, known as IO functions (functions with side effects), which includes writing files, reading input, opening windows, etc.\nTo solve this problem, if we cannot test the real system in the real world, we must model the real life system and then conduct testing. Therefore, the same actions applied to the real-life system, when applied to the model, both results should be identical.\nUsing the previous concept, quick check generates a random sequence of actions. After applying the same sequence on both the model and the real-world system, we compare the results.\nNext, we will apply property-based testing techniques to test the Plutus smart contracts.\nIn this way, we create a model and then define our expected results when applying specific actions.\nFrom here, we provide a link between the model and the real-world system. In our case, this is not the blockchain but the emulator trace.\nFigure 1: Declaration of the TSState data type\nUltimately, we have to define a model for our Token Sale contract.\nSo, we begin by defining a data type called TSState , representing the State of one Token Sale Contract Instance.\nThis TSState is a triple consisting of the token price, the amount of Lovelace and tokens.\nAt this stage, we can construct our model by defining the token Sale model TSModel , representing a type class ContractModel instance.\nAs discussed in the previous Testing Articles, in our model, we should specify all the business logic. That means we specify how our model should behave and how it is linked to the real world.\nFigure 2: Implementation of the Token Sale Model Part 1\nBefore moving on to the next part, I think a disclaimer is necessary!\nConstructing the Token Sale Model is a bit tricky, and its implementation is quite long.\nSo, below, we will present the details of implementing 14 functions of our Token Sale Model.\nSorry, in advance, if you feel frustrated reading the following.\nDespite this, it is definitely worth understanding how to construct a model. This model is comparable with our real blockchain (in our case, the emulator trace).\nThis model is needed to apply property-based testing for our Plutus Smart Contract.\nFirst, we need to create a Associated Action type , representing the actions that a quick check will generate and control. See figure 2\nThese actions are:\n- Start the Token Sale Contract\n- Set Price\n- Add Token\n- Withdraw\n- Buy Token\nFor argument's sake, we have two wallets in our example. This means the second argument wallet tries to withdraw pre-defined ADA from the Token sale contract run by the wallet declared in the first argument function.\nThis withdrawal action, for example, should fail if the two wallets are not the same.\nWe implement a Second Associated Data type called ContractInstanceKey. See figure 2\nHere, the goal is to define a key for each instance of the token sale contract we run.\nWe create the instanceWallet function. See figure 2\nThis function explains to the system how to extract a wallet on which a contract is running.\nThe following method we need to implement is the instanceTag function in our Token Sale model, which returns a ContractInstanceTag. See figure 2\nThis function will then be used on the blockchain side to identify running instances of contracts and interact with them by naming them endpoints.\nNext function is arbitraryAction function.\nFigure 3: Implementation of the Token Sale Model Part 2\nAs we described the property-based testing approach, we have said that our Testing Framework will take charge of generating random actions. These will then be fed to our tests.\nAs the name indicates, this function generates an arbitrary action, which will be fed to our tests.\nFor example, when generating a random BuyToken Action, we should pick a random Wallet that runs the contract (first argument: genWallet). After that, we will pick a second random wallet that interacts with the contract (second argument: genWallet). Finally, we will generate a random integer representing the ADA we want to buy (third argument genNonNeg).\nWhat follows is an example of the random generation of actions (Test Data) using repl:\nFigure 4: Random Generation of our Actions (Test Data)\nThe next function we should implement in our model is the initialState function.\n**A**s the name shows, it represents the initial state of our model. In our case, in the beginning, we should set an empty initial state, because no Token Sale will be there at the beginning.\nFigure 5: Implementation of the Token Sale Model Part 2\nThe following method we need to implement is called initialInstances. Similar to the name, it gives the initial contract instances that must run.\nSee figure 5\nThe next function is precondition. See figure 5\nThis function is essential because it allows us to set the legality of actions, given a specific model state.\nFor example, the precondition of triggering a Start Action of a Token Sale Contract, is that no Token Sale Contract should have already started. In such an instance, we must know the current State of the Token Sale Contract to check the preconditions for running Actions.\nIndeed, to know the current State of our Token Sale Contract, we have to specify a helper function called getTSState , which returns the state of our Token Sale Contract. Hence, given a ModelState (as the next point discusses), and the wallet, we try to extract the token sale TSState that this wallet runs.\nRecall, TSState is a triple consisting of:\n- The Token Price\n- The amount of Lovelace\n- The amount of Tokens.\n(See Previous Point 3. Property-Based Testing in Plutus)\nAs seen, to set the preconditions, we must understand the notion of the Model State.\nTo learn more about the Model State, we can have a look at the Plutus documentation\nFigure 6: Model State Definition in the Plutus Documentation\nThe Model State Data type has multiple functions that operates with it.\nThe most important one is the contractState function, also known as a lens: A lens from ModelState to State .\nGiven our Token Sale Model (TSModel), a hierarchical type, we must use lenses to get the State of the contract, which is data in the TSModel hierarchy.\nSo, in our example, the contract state is accessible from the ModelState via the contractState function, which is a lens.\nNow, we can understand our past discussion on the notion of optics and lenses in Haskell. (Check the concept of Optics and Lenses in Haskell in the previous article)\nBut our ModelState contains not only the contractState function but also the currentSlot function, which returns the current Slot as shown by the name.\nModelState also provides balanceChanges functions, which, given a Wallet, can check how its balance has changed.\nBut in our example, we will only use two functions: contractState and currentSlot.\nNow we will check the implementation of another Token Sale Model function called nextState. This function is the most complex and perhaps the most important.\nRegarding constructing our model and its link to our real system (emulator trace), we have said that we must know which effect that action will have on our model for each performed action. And that s precisely the goal of our nextState function.\nFigure 7: Implementation of the Token Sale Model Part 3 nextState function\nAs we can see in the code, our nextState function has an input parameter and Action on a TSModel. From here, it returns a Spec Monad.\nThe spec monad s purpose is to describe effects on the model, our Token Sale Model (TSModel). So, it describes the impact on the contract state, the flow of funds between the wallets, and the time (slots).\nFor each triggered Action (Start contract, SetPrice, AddTokens, BuyTokens, Withdraw Tokens), we perform specific tasks to synchronize wallet balances, token prices, minimal fees and the time (in slots) between our model and real-world system. This should be the real blockchain, but in our case, it is the emulator trace.\nNext, we will go over implementing two other Token Sale Model functions, the startInstances function. This function specifies when starting the Token Sale Contracts (either at the beginning or later).\nFigure 8: Implementation of the Token Sale Model Part 4\nThe instanceContract function : Which starts providing the link between our model and the emulator. (see figure 8)\nFinally, we implement the last Token Sale Model function, called the perform function. (see figure 8)\nThis function provides an instance of the contract model class. So, basically, it tells how an action (SetPrice, AddTokens, BuyTokens, Withdraw) is expressed in actuality in the emulator on the blockchain.\nAs a form of conclusion and to utilize all previous functions, we define the prop_TS function.\nFigure 9: prop_TS function implementation\nWe can see that in the prop_TS function, we are composing the propRunActionsWithOptions function using the withMaxSuccess function.\nThe former represents a Plutus function, which is in this Plutus.Contract.Test.ContractModel in the Plutus documentation\nThe latter is a quick check function, where we specify how many test cases to run. Here, 100 is the default, but this makes it easy to increase or decrease that figure.\nWe continue to understand the TS_prop function. We can now see that we are setting the initial distribution for every wallet with an InitialDistribution called d :\n- Wallet 1 has 1000 Tokens A and is selling these types of tokens\nNext, defaultCoverageOptions checks whether the performed actions in the blockchain (emulator trace in our case) are actually reflected in the model.\nTo run our tests in the repl, we finally declare test, which simply applies Quick Check to this prop_TS function. (See figure 9)\nSo, this means that Quick Check will generate random action sequences and discover whether the Property (expected results or assertions) is fulfilled.\nThe property checked is included in the nextState function definition, which we have seen previously in 4.9.\nFigure 10: Running the tests with repl\nAfter running the tests with repl, we achieved these results: All 100 tests run successfully.\nThe test results also contain the number of actions randomly chosen by QuickCheck, as discussed.\nWe can also check the number of actions rejected due to nonvalid preconditions, as specified in our code.\nFigure 11: Test Suite implementation\nAt this juncture, we can pack all our tests into a single test suite.\nOur tests are now in a Type TestTree from the Taste framework we saw earlier.\nWe use the notion of testGroup and put into it our emulator trace test that we saw at the beginning of the blog post.\nQuick check tests verify the flow of funds and check whether our assertions from our model are passing.\nPreviously, we tested the actions in a random sequence. However, it is also possible to test a specific sequence of actions.\nOne limitation is that we cannot test all possible off-chain codes. A malicious actor could, for example, write an off-chain code that can steal funds from our contract.\nOur quick check model cannot check all possibilities of an off-chain code. It is to use the contracts we give in the perform method we have seen.\nAnother limitation is concurrency. In our code previously, we have configured our actions to last exactly three slots. But in our real blockchain, our actions could stay for more time due to possible concurrency of transactions. This problem could be avoided by setting further conditions in our model.\nProperty-based testing is a powerful tool that allows us to test various possibilities of our code and tremendously increase the quality and security of our smart contracts.\nUsing my knowledge from the software testing and test automation domains, we should be aware that implementing property-based testing or test automation independently doesn t assure software quality.\nIn fact, running tests that all passing doesn t even mean that our code is free of bugs.\nAccording to ISTQB, the international standard of testing, the Seven Testing principles , we should remember some important quality concepts:\n- Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence\n- Exhaustive testing (testing everything) is impossible\n- Absence-of-errors is a fallacy\nISTQB Foundation Level (CTFL) Syllabus Version 2018 v3.1.1\nThat means running tests that all pass doesn t assure the quality of the software because it doesn t confirm the absence of bugs. Testing all possible combinations and possibilities of a complex system is impossible.\nThat s why we must follow a risk-based approach and cover the riskiest components of software through stringent testing.\nStandards like ISTQB helps a lot when defining such testing strategies.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find the original article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link.\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Plutus Pioneer Program Part 1 Understanding the eUTXO Model and Coding the first Smart Contract?",
    "completion": "The first and second Plutus Pioneer Program lessons are about understanding the eUTXO Model, configuring the development environment, and diving in practically by coding the first smart contract with Plutus.\n1- The Extended UTXO Model\nThe eUTXO Model extends the UTXO Model that Bitcoin utilizes. Ultimately, one of the eUTXO Model s primary advantages, compared to Ethereum s account based model, is that all transactions are deterministic.\nIn this way, we are confident of the transaction status, whether it will pass or fail, before submitting it to the blockchain. Cardano transactions depend on their inputs and outputs and not from the global state of the blockchain, unlike Ethereum.\nFurthermore, the eUTXO Model ensures high security and scalability, which is delivered through its powerful parallelization. Cardano is built with a quality-first approach in mind. After all, focusing on delivering high quality and secure DApps should be the blockchain industry s number one focus.\nFigure 1: A visual representation of Transactions, UTXOs, flow of funds and in a eUTXO based model\n2- Setting up the development environment:\nBefore writing the Plutus Pioneer Program s scripts, we should create the development environment by installing nix, checking out the Plutus-apps repo, launching the nix-shell, compiling the course s code, and finally, running a local instance of the playground.\nI encountered challenges when configuring the local development environment on my Mac. However, thanks to tips from the Cardano StackExchange and documentation from the Cardano community, I have solved those problems and correctly set up all the artifacts.\nConsequently, the developer s community engagement within the Cardano ecosystem, as well as how helpful they are, is displayed.\nFigure 2: Starting nix-shell and the playground server in Mac M1: Step by Step guide written by Cardano Community member in Github\nAfter configuring the environment, you will gain access to high level Plutus and Marlowe documentation, which runs on a local server using port 8002.\nFigure 3: High Level Documentation of Plutus and Marlowe running on a local server on port 8002\nThe haddock detailed documentation for all the Plutus libraries is also accessible in the same server; this is run locally in port 8002. The extensive documentation provided contains further technical concepts, including clarifications of important Plutus details.\nFigure 4: Haddock documentation of Plutus running on a local server on port 8002\n3- Understanding the notion of a Plutus validator\nPrior to coding the first smart contract, it s first vital to gain an understanding of the Plutus validator.\nBriefly, Plutus validators are functions with three inputs that return a boolean. The three inputs are the datum, the redeemer, and the script context. If the validator script returns a true result, the user can unlock the funds sitting at the script address.\nAll developers interested in Cardano should dive into the course and begin coding smart contracts using Plutus. Usually, this it the best way to gain an understanding of the technology used.\nTo learn more about Plutus through a short video, I highly recommend you view this amazing short video by John Woods.\n4- Coding the first Smart Contract\nIn the first and second Plutus Pioneer Program lectures, we get our hands dirty by coding our first smart contract. This initial contract is an Auction Contract for an NFT.\nIn this way, the auction covers an open bid for an NFT. At the end of the bidding, the highest bidder receives the NFT.\nThe graph below offers an excellent example of an NFT bid, as well as the flows of the UTXOs.\nFigure 5: A visual representation of the Transaction, UTXOs, flow of funds and in a eUTXO based model\nBeneath I have included a screenshot example of the Plutus validator code. When viewing the code the first time, it may seem tricky to understand, but actually, it isn t. Dr. Lars Br njes uses an excellent pedagogical methodology to comb over each part of the code.\nFigure 6: The Auction Plutus Validator Script\nWhen learning Plutus, I also found the number of available tools, which help developers grasp the technology, simply amazing. One such tool is the Plutus Playground, which represents a visualization of the written code and simulation of its execution.\nUsing the Plutus playground, you can test different scenarios of the NFT Auction Validator and, after that, check the UTXO flows and the scenario results.\nFigure 7: Configuring a scenario of the auction validator script in the Plutus playground\nFigure 8: Transaction inputs and outputs for a configured scenario of the auction validator script\nYou can find the original article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link.\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Plutus Pioneer Program Part 2 How to deploy a Smart Contract in Cardano?",
    "completion": "This blog post will demonstrate how to simulate the execution of a smart contract and how to ** **deploy it to the testnet through using various tools. Using the term deploying a smart contract is not accurate in the context of the Cardano Blockchain. We will explain the reason behind it later.\nI will try to break down technical concepts using straightforward and simple language. My goal is to make these technical terms understandable for all audiences. Ultimately, this blog post is a worthwhile not only for DApps developers but also for non-technical Cardano community members. After all, the knowledge here will empower your faith in Cardano when you discover Plutus various powerful tools, helping every developer to build scalable and secure DApps.\nIn this blog post, we will present the concepts explained in the third lecture of the Plutus Pioneer Program, where we implemented a vesting smart contract. Here, a donor locks a specific fund in a script address. Then, only certain beneficiaries can obtain these funds once a deadline has been reached.\nThere are two ways to simulate a smart contract s execution. The first method by the Plutus playground was outlined in the previous blog post.\nHowever, the second method involves using the emulator trace monad. Contrary to the Plutus Playground, where you should write and configure the simulated scenario by hand, the emulator trace monad forces you to script the simulator tab.\nFigure 1: Overview of final state of the wallets after the smart contract execution using the emulator trace monad\nMaybe the notion of monads is a little bit strange for you; this is especially true if you are not familiar with functional programming. That s why Lars has explained the notion of monads in lecture 4 through a separate long-form video (around one and a half hours).\nAlthough monads may seem a little complicated, learning this concept is extremely useful when working with Plutus. This is because you have to understand the two types of monads in Plutus. These are the emulator trace monad, as described previously, and the contract monad, which allows you to write off chain code. Also, the contract monad is also called the wallet code. Finally, the same logic of the contract monad could be constructed using the Cardano cli.\nContrary to Ethereum, the Validator Script in Cardano doesn t live in the Blockchain. Instead, the hash of the script is submitted within the transaction when interacting with a smart contract instance. Thus, the notion of deployment doesn t exist in Cardano. However, for the sake of this example, we will still use the term contract deployment in the blog post.\nAs discussed at the blog s beginning, we have written a vesting smart contract. After simulating contract execution by using the Plutus Playground or the Emulator trace monad, we can deploy it to the testent and execute it.\nBut, first, we need to complete some preparatory work.\n2.1- Installing and Running a Cardano Node and Creating the addresses and the key pairs:\nTo interact with the Cardano testnet blockchain, we must submit transactions using the Cardano CLI. Hence, we have to install and run a node on the testnet.\nThere is vast documentation available to show how to complete that process perfectly.\nYou can find such help in this link.\nNext, we should create two addresses and their corresponding keypairs. The first address should correspond to the donor, while the second address will correspond to the beneficiary.\nFigure 2: A Shell script to run a Cardano Node locally on the Cardano testnet\nFigure 3: Cardano Node running and synchronizing with the Cardano testnet\n2.2- Requesting funds from the faucet\nTo submit transactions to the blockchain, we must first fund both addresses with some Test ADA in our address.\nThe request can be submitted through Cardano testnet faucet.\nFigure 4: Cardano testnet faucet\n2.3- Serialize and write to disc some Plutus Types to be able to deploy the validator script using Cardano CLI\nTo be able to deploy a Plutus script using the Cardano cli, we must do some preparation work. Also, we have to make changes to the script to serialize and write to disc various Plutus types. For simplicity reasons, I will not outline all steps. Instead, to learn more about that, you can check lecture 3 of the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nAfter making the changes to the Plutus script, we can now build and generate the script file and the script address.\nFigure 5: Building and generating the script file and address using the Cardano cli\nNext, we can construct a give shell script, which consists of building the transaction and locking the funds at the script address.\nAfter submitting these transactions, we can verify that the funds sent from our first address are sitting at the script address and locked, waiting for the deadline to pass and for the beneficiary address to grab them.\nFigure 6: Overview of the give.sh shell script\nWe can now construct the grab shell script. This script allows the beneficiary address to grab the funds locked in our contract upon reaching the deadline.\nAfter executing the grab.sh script, we can check that all funds have been transferred from the script address to the beneficiary address.\nNow, we have successfully tested the full deployment and execution scenario on the testnet using the Cardano cli.\nFigure 7: Overview of the grab.sh shell script\nThere is a second way to deploy a smart contract using the PAB. With this approach, you can avoid changing the types manually in the Plutus Script, as previous point 2.3 of this blog post describes. Using the power of the PAB, we can interact with an instance of our contract simply using some APIs.\nFigure 8: SwaggerUI API Specification for Interacting with the Smart Contracts through the PAB using APIs\nStill, first, we must set up and run various tools: the Plutus PAB, the Cardano Wallet, the Chain Index, and a Cardano Node.\nFigure 9: The hosted deployment scenario for the PAB with the WBE (wallet backend)\nLars effectively explains this method in lecture 6 of the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nTo know more about the PAB, you can check this link.\nYou can find the original article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link.\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Plutus Pioneer Program Part 3 How to Mint and Burn Tokens and NFTs in Cardano?",
    "completion": "The last blog covered how to deploy Smart Contracts in Cardano after simulating and testing its execution.\nToday, however, we have a more interesting part: how to mint and burn tokens in Cardano using Plutus technology and how to write a corresponding minting policy.\nAs we may recall from previous blog posts, Cardano s main difference compared to account-based models like Ethereum is the Extended UTXO Model.\nThis essentially means any transaction in Cardano must consume one or more UTXOs that carry ADA as well as other non fungible or fungible tokens.\nIn fact, when you receive fungible tokens from another user, the transactions carrying the fungible or non-fungible token must include a minimal amount of ADA.\nFor example, as seen in the figure below, you can see a transaction history where one user has sent around 537 SUNDAE fungible tokens to another user. So, the transaction includes around 1.34 ADA, which represents the minimal amount of ADA needed to send the previously mentioned tokens.\nFigure 1: A transaction carrying 537 SUNDAE Token and a minimum required amount of ADA\nThe exact same applies to NFTs. In this way, you must include a minimal amount of ADA when sending the transactions carrying the NFT.\nBelow is a screenshot of transaction details where a user sends an NFT called peakchain . Here, the same logic as the previous transaction with fungible tokens applies, and this transaction carries a minimal amount of ADA, which is, in this example, around 1,48.\nFigure 2: A transaction carrying a PeakChain NFT and a minimum required amount of ADA\nImportantly, unlike Ethereum, where the both fungible (ERC-20) and non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens are not native tokens, all non fungible and fungible tokens in Cardano are native tokens that behave just like ADA.\nHowever, the striking difference is that these tokens can be minted or burned based on a specified minting policy defined from the beginning by the user, but ADA cannot be minted or burned.\nWe will discuss later why, technically, ADA cannot be minted or burned.\nTo be able to mint and burn tokens, the user should write a minting policy, like the Plutus validator we described in earlier blog posts. We can recall that a validator has three inputs: the datum, the redeemer, and the context.\nMeanwhile, however, in the minting policies, we have just two inputs, redeemer and context, so we don t have a datum.\nAnother feature of Cardano is that we can mint many tokens in one transaction simply because we can include many minting policies in one transaction.\nFigure 3: Overview of the on-chain part: the minting policy\nHere is an example of a minting policy, where we specified the public key of the user who is allowed to mint the token as an input. This part is called the on-chain part of our script.\nNext, for us to test the specified minting policy, we must create an off-chain part. This section is often called the endpoint and is executed by the user s wallet.\nWe can test this endpoint using the emulator trace monad that we explained in a previous blog.\nFigure 4: Overview of the off-chain part: the minting endpoint\nThis represents the off chain code called an endpoint. Here, we have to specify the minting parameters, which are the Token name, the amount of the minted token, and of course, the minting policy we have previously defined.\nHowever, prior to going further with the simulation execution using Monad, it may be worth explaining the differences between token name and currency symbol. After all, these are two important paradigms to understand when minting Tokens.\nSo, the question is, why do we need a currency symbol and a token name for each token in Cardano?\nThe token name is fairly straightforward, representing the name of the minted token, which should be a string like ABC , PeakChain , etc.\nHowever, the currency symbol is not quite the same. Instead, the currency symbol is a string that is built from hexadecimal digits. For example, a8ff .\nTo begin, it s best to explain that each minting or burning transaction should pay a fee based on the script size that the nodes should execute to validate the transaction. In this way, fees depend on the size of the transactions in bytes, meaning it depends on the size of the script to validate, which is contained in the transaction.\nTo simplify even further, to calculate the costs of minting a token, we should include the hash of the minting policy in the transaction, represented by the Currency symbol.\nWhy could ADA not technically be minted or burned?\nAs noted previously, ADA could not be minted or burned. Technically, the explanation is that the currency symbol of ADA is just an empty string, which could not be the hash of any script. Thus, no script can mint or burn ADA.\nPerhaps, however, it could be said that burning ADA is possible by sending it to an address with lost private keys so no one could access them. While this is partially true, the total amount of ADA, in this case, will not be reduced but just unlocked forever.\nAs presented in previous blog posts, after creating the validator script, which in our case is the minting policy, as well as upon completing coding the endpoint, we can now test our code by simulating its execution.\nHere, there are two methods available the first of which is using the Plutus playground. We paste the whole code on our tool and configure the input parameters.\nIn the following scenario in the screenshot below, we mint 555 pieces of a token that we call it ABC by wallet one. The second wallet mints also a 444 Token ABC . In this example, we didn t specify in the minting policy which user is allowed to mint the Token ABC . This is in contrast to the former policy, where only one user could mint a specific token based on their public key hash.\nTo add a further example, in what follows, we have specified a policy where everyone could mint this token.\nFor now, we ll move back to the scenario in questions. After waiting for some time, wallet one will burn 222 of the same token.\nFigure 5: Overview of the configuration of the Plutus Playground Tool to simulate the minting script\nNext, we perform the scenario to check the results. Ultimately, we have got three UTXOs as output of the minting transaction. The first UTXO contains the fees. The second UTXO contains the remaining amount of ADA that the wallet possesses after subtracting the fees and the minimal required ADA (the concept of min ADA was already explained previously in point 1 of the blog). The third transaction output comes with the amount of the newly minted token, 444 ABC tokens.\nFigure 6: Overview of the minting transaction input and outputs of Wallet two\nNow, we can look at the minting transaction results submitted by Wallet one, where we have minted 555 ABC Tokens.\nFigure 7: Overview of the input and outputs of the minting transaction of the Wallet one\nBut now, the third transaction is burning about 222 ABC Tokens in its possession. So, this means just 333 ABC remains in its balance.\nFigure 8: Overview of the input and outputs of the burning transaction of the Wallet one\nAs a previous blog analyzed, Plutus Scripts could be tested using the emulator trace wallet, which is a more practical way to test our scripts when building a DApp. Hence, Lars conducted a presentation on how to simulate the minting and burning script using the emulator trace Monad.\nFigure 9: Overview of the emulator trace Monad, as well as the final state of the wallets after executing the minting and burning scripts\nAs discussed in an earlier post, we can deploy a smart contract using two tools. One of these tools is the Cardano CLI, and the second is the Plutus Application Backend. The two methods were discussed in detail in the sixth lecture of the Plutus pioneer program.\nNaturally, it is possible to mint a token by utilizing the same tools. In this way, each tool poses unique advantages and disadvantages.\nUsing the CLI, we should do a lot of manual work compared to the PAB scenario. Also, we must do some preparation work. Finally, we must alter the script to serialize and write to disc various Plutus types.\nBut, with PAB, this kind of preparatory work is not necessary. Still, we must install various Plutus Apps locally, which are obviously resource-intensive.\nThese tools include the Plutus PAB, the Cardano Wallet, the Chain Index, and a Cardano Node.\nTo learn more about the PAB, check this link.\nYou can find the original article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link.\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Plutus Pioneer Program Part 4 State Machine with Plutus 12?",
    "completion": "State Machine is a crucial concept that enables Plutus DApps developers to write more concise and qualitatively better contracts on-chain as well as off-chain. A shorter code means a more readable code and results in a better software quality.\nIn this blog post, we will present a simple Game in the Cardano Blockchain, and we will implement it with a first approach without a State Machine.\nIn the next article, we will refactor the code of the same Game and implement it with the State Machine concept and highlight the advantages of this approach.\nThis concept was presented in the seventh lecture of the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nIn order to emphasize the differences between the code with and without State Machine, Lars presented a Game that will be implemented using Plutus smart contracts.\nTwo players, Alice and Bob, are playing a very simple game; each has the choice between 0 or 1. If both players choose different numbers, the first player wins; otherwise, the second player wins.\nThe game s main challenge is that the first player should reveal his choice in an ambiguous format, so the second player cannot read it.\nHere are the proposed game steps to solve the previous issue:\nStep 1: The first player must choose a random nonce. Then they concatenate it with his choice of 0 or 1.\nStep2: The second player should reveal his choice of 0 or 1.\nStep 3: The first player should reveal the random nonce that he chose in step 1 and prove that the hash he has already delivered in step 1 corresponds indeed to the hash of the concatenation of the random nonce chosen in step 1, and his chosen number 0 or 1.\nFigure 1: Representation of the steps of the Game\nFigure 2: Modelization of the different States of the Game\nOne of the main challenges when implementing this Game is how to modelize a State.\nBefore diving deep into the implementation details, it s worth discussing the differences between Cardano and Ethereum regarding states.\nIn Ethereum, states are mutable. Hence, if we try to implement our game in Ethereum, we have to simply change the state after each player s move. But the notion of mutable states could be potentially a leading source of security issues.\nIn contrast, in Cardano, we don t have the notion of mutable states because UTXOs are immutable. The UTXO Model indeed assures a high degree of security and quality for Applications build on Cardano. This advantage is one of the main reasons why I have chosen Cardano.\nImmutable UTXOs means that we cannot change a UTXO. In fact, we must consume the old UTXO carrying the old state and create a new one with the new state. In this case, we must link the two UTXOs to recognize that they relate to each other and represent a state transition.\nThe trick here is that the UTXOs should contain the same NFT, which the gToken field will present in our newly created Game data.\nFigure 3: Part of the on-chain code of our Game\nIn practice, the UTXO will carry a Datum, called Game Datum , corresponding to the actual state of the game, and also carry an NFT, which will act as a link between the UTXOs carrying the state of the game.\nAnother challenge is that we must identify the UTXO carrying the current state among all UTXOs potentially sitting at the same script address. Indeed, we cannot enforce an address to carry just one unique UTXO.\nIn fact, the same previously mentioned NFT would help us to identify the UTXO carrying the current state of the game from all UTXOs sitting at the same address.\nMoving to the GameRedeemer , we can check that it represents the logic of our game, based on the GameChoice (Datum corresponding to the State of the game) and the nonce revealed by the first player if he wins.\nFigure 4: GameRedeemer\nNow we tackle the main part of our code, which is the mkGameValidator (Make Game Validator) function, which carries the core business logic of our game. It is composed of all transitions in our Game. Each code block below represents one game transition.\nFigure 5: mkGameValidator (Make Game Validator) function\nHere is a description of the four transitions represented by the mkGameValidator function:\nFirst Transition: is where the first player has moved, and the second player has to move.\nSecond Transition: where the first player wins, so he has to reveal his chosen random nonce.\nThird Transition: where the second player hasn t moved yet, and the deadline for the game has passed, so the second player wins and claims the funds.\nFourth Situation: where the second player wins, or when the first player didn t reveal his nonce or missed the deadline, and he indeed loses.\nNow we can write the off-chain code, allowing us to test the game and simulate its execution using the emulator trace.\nThe code is a bit long, so I think it s not worth writing here because we are focused more on describing the concept of state machines.\nYou can check the whole code in the GitHub repository for week07 of the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nWhen we start simulating the game execution, first, we simulate a first case where both players chose the value 0.\nFigure 6: Execution of our game using the choices Player 1: Zero, Player 2: Zero\nWe can see that the wallet corresponding to the first player has received almost 100ADA (minus the transaction fees), and the NFT is identifying the UTXO carrying the actual state of the game, which is called, in our case: STATE TOKEN .\nFigure 7: Final balances of the players accounts in Lovelace after playing the game\nNow, we simulate a second case where the second player wins and check the final balances of the players wallets.\nFigure 8: Execution of our game using the choices Player 1: Zero, Player 2: One\nFigure 9: Final balances of the players accounts in Lovelace after playing the game\nAs said previously, in the next article \"Plutus Pioneer Program - Part 4: State Machine with Plutus (2/2)\", we will refactor the code of the same Game and implement it with a State Machine and highlight the advantages of this approach.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find the original article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link.\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Plutus Pioneer Program Part 5 State Machine with Plutus 22?",
    "completion": "In this blog post, we will proceed with the Game Example that we have seen in the last aticle. We will refactor the code to eliminate the redundant logic and optimize code using the concept of State Machines in Plutus.\nState Machine: Represented by the UTXO sitting at the State Machine address.\nState: Represented by the datum of the UTXO sitting at the State Machine address.\nTransition: It s the transaction that consumes the current UTXO using a redeemer that characterizes the transition. In our game, we have written the redeemer based on the players choices.\nTo link the three concepts together, we can say that the transaction representing the state transition produces a UTXO sitting at the same script address, but with a datum carrying the new state. The UTXO carrying the current state is identified by a specific NFT.\nWe can find details about the state machine implementation in the Plutus documentation, more exactly in the Plutus.Contract.StateMachine Module.\nFigure 1: State machine implementation in Plutus documentation.\nAs cited in the documentation, the state machine has two inputs:\nS (State), which corresponds to the datum type;\nI (Input), which corresponds to the redeemer type.\nNow, we will take a look at the four functions of the state machine in Plutus:\nThis function represents a transition in a state machine. Practically, given a state s and a redeemer i, we can either get nothing if the transition fails (not allowed) or, if the transition succeeds, we return a Tuple.\nIndeed, the smTransition returns s, which represents the new state, is composed of the value of the UTXO generated by our transition transaction and the corresponding new datum.\nFigure 2: Representation of the State in the Plutus documentation.\nOur smTransition also returns TxConstraints, which are additional constraints that the transition transaction should satisfy.\nThis function returns a boolean indicating whether the last transition is final or not.\nIf the state is final, the state machine stops and doesn t generate a new UTXO.\nThis function is similar to the smTransition function, but returns a boolean as a result of a transaction check.\nThis function allows us to apply further checks to the state transition (transaction) that are not covered by the TxConstraints in the smTransition function.\nAs described in the documentation, the default implementation of this function is always returning a true value.\nWe have previously mentioned that the transition function must carry an NFT (called Thread Token) in order to distinguish the UTXO sitting at the state machine address carrying the current state from other UTXOs sitting at the same address, which are obviously not relevant to us.\nThis function allows us to automatically mint and handle this NFT.\nNow, we will return to the code representing our game to refactor it based on the concepts of the State Machine.\nFigure 3: Implementation of the Game Type in the Case of State Machine\nFirst, we begin with the game type. The main difference compared to the previous implementation without a state machine is that we have now changed the type of the gToken (which represents the NFT distinguishing the UTXO carrying the actual state from other UTXOs sitting at the same address) from AssetClass to ThreadToken in order to conform with state machine functions, as discussed previously.\nThe second difference is that we added a Finished constructor for the state GameDatum , which represents the final state of the state machine, which is, of course, the final state of the game.\nFigure 4: Implementation of the Game Datum in the Case of State Machine.\nThe third and main difference in the state machine code occurs in the transition function of the state machine, carrying the core business logic of our game, which replaced the mkGameValidator that we have previously seen.\nFigure 5: Implementation of the Transition function with State Machine\nHere are the main differences and similarities between the transition function (case with state machine implementation) and the mkGameValidator function (case without state machine implementation):\n- The code of the transition function is considerably shorter than the mkGameValidator;\n- The signatures of the two functions are different. In the transition function, we have to check whether the combination of the transaction with the datum and the redeemer is valid or not;\n- An advantage with the state machine is that we don t have to check if the UTXO that we are consuming carries the NFT used as an identifier. This will be done automatically by the state machine;\n- The state machine transition function will check automatically if the state is final or not;\n- In the state machine s case, we don t need the helper functions ownInput and ownOutput to validate the values of the UTXOs, previously used in the implementation without a state machine;\n- In the transition function, we cannot check the nonce revealed by the first player using a constraint, so we have to declare that in a separate function. This function will be called check (see Figure 16);\nFigure 6: Comparison between parts of the mkGameValidator function (implementation without a state machine) with the corresponding parts in the transition function (implementation with a state machine).\nIn this step, we can define the State Machine function that we will call gameStateMachine.\nOur state machine function takes as input the:\nTransition function;\nFinal state check function;\nNonce check function;\nThread Token (NFT) check function.\nFinally, we can declare the mkGameValidator , which, in this case, will take the state machine function as input.\nFigure 7: Implementation of the nonce check function, gameStateMachine function, and mkGameValidator function.\nAdditionally, in order to be able to interact with the state machine from the off-chain code (from a wallet), one of the main differences is that we have to use a StateMachine Client called gameClient .\nFigure 8: Representation of the State Machine Client in the Plutus documentation.\nNow, we will move to our off-chain code, which is shorter than the implementation without a state machine because our state machine simplifies the thread token (NFT) handling and provides a bunch of functions to retrieve the current state (getOnChainState function).\nFigure 9: Representation of the getOnChainState function.\nAnother important state machine function that makes the code more compact is the runStep function, which allows automatic state transitioning by submitting transactions.\nFigure 10: Representation of the runStep function.\nAfter completing the off-chain code, we can test the game and simulate its execution using the emulator trace, which will obviously return the same results as those previously presented in the implementation without a state machine.\nAn excellent example of where to use the state machine is the case of a token sale. So Lars presented the example and some of the possible states of this use case and implemented it using the state machine.\nYou can check the details of the implementation in Lecture 8 of the Plutus Pioneer program under this link.\nState machines are a very important concept that we should use, when it s appropriate to do so, to reduce the amount of code and eliminate code duplications in the off-chain, as well as in the on-chain code. A shorter code means a more readable code and better quality.\nIndeed, the mechanism of identifying the UTXO carrying the current state and handling the NFT identifying this UTXO is handled automatically by the state machine.\nNevertheless, it s also worth mentioning that contracts written using state machines are resources hungry compared to contracts written without state machines. In fact, more resources are required to run these types of validators and minting policies. That s why this concept is not yet widely used in practice, but the Plutus development team is working on optimizing State Machines with Plutus.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find the original article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link.\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Testing Plutus Smart Contracts 13?",
    "completion": "To guarantee secure and high-quality smart contracts, rigorous testing strategies should be implemented. These will significantly differ from standard testing techniques typically used in low-risk web 2 applications.\nTesting in Plutus has been be thoroughly covered in the 8th lecture of the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nMy background, which is largely in software quality in test automation, means I was ecstatic to discover the blockchain testing concepts, especially with Plutus.\nIn three Plutus Testing related articles, we will go over special techniques on how to test Plutus smart contracts using the emulator trace, calculate test coverage, the notion of optics and lenses, and Property Based Testing.\nTo show testing strategies, in the 8th lecture of the Plutus Pioneer Program, Lars presented a Use Case implementation with State Machine, an example of a Token Sale.\nIn this example, a seller wants to buy a certain amount of Tokens by locking them in a contract and then setting their prices. In this way, the seller is able to retrieve their locked Tokens at any time.\nFigure 1: Modelization of the flow of UTXOs of the Token Sale Use Case\nUpon implementing our on-chain and off-chain Token Sale code using the state machine mechanism, as covered in our last article, we can attempt our code by using the emulator trace.\nThe Plutus Pioneer Program GitHub repository of week 8 could help with checking details of the implementation:\nPrior to testing out our code, first, we should configure the emulator trace.\nEach fund first needs some initial fund defining. So, we must fund three wallets needed for our use case, not only with 1000 ADA each but also with 1000 customized Tokens we called A .\nFigure 2: Configuring the emulator by funding three wallets with ADA and A Token\nNext, we should set up the use case steps:\nWallet 1, representing the seller, sets the price of the Token to 1 ADA, and after that locks 100 A Token in the contract.\nWallet 2 buys 20 ADA\nWallet 3 buys 5 Tokens\nWallet 1 (the seller) retrieved 40 A tokens and 10 ADA from the Token Sale contract.\nFigure 3: Configuring the EmulatorTrace with a specific Token Sale case\nThe previous code is written as a Test Suite. This meant the code could be run as a test executable file.\nAfter running the test suite, we can check the file balances of the three wallets.\nFigure 4: Final Balances of the Wallets after running the Token Sale Test Suite\nWhat follows is an explanation of the final balances we see in the previous figure:\nWallet 2: Bought 20 A Token using 20 ADA\nWallet 3: Bought 5 A Tokens using 5 ADA\nWallet1: Placed 100 A Tokens and withdrew 40 A Tokens from the contract again.\nIn wallet 1, we can discover that 2 ADA are missing: We withdrew 10 ADA, but we got just 8 ADA.\nThe reasoning behind this is simple: to set up the token sale UTXO, we must deposit a minimum amount of ADA. However, this amount is variable in the real blockchain (testnet or mainnet) and depends on the size of the UTXO.\nIn the emulator trace, however, for simplification reasons, the min ADA is fixed and set to 2 ADA.\nThe minimal ADA deposit was not mentioned explicitly in our code. Thus, the state machine takes care of that and sets it automatically, representing a clear advantage of using the state machine concept.\nIn the , we prepared what can only be described as a manual test in Plutus.\nNevertheless, automated tests bring more advantages, supplying the ability to configure and run regression tests. These tests could, thus, be configured to automatically execute once a new software release is deployed.\nVarious testing frameworks in Haksell provide a good automation experience, which is achieved by organizing the tests suites, grouping them, labeling them, etc.\nHere, Plutus utilized the Tasty Test Framework\nHackage offers more information about this framework: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tastyThrough the Tasty framework, tests have the type TestTree , which, as the name indicates, means a tree of tests. Remember this type for later in Plutus tests.\nBy using the Tasty framework, we cam combine different type of tests, like unit tests, golden tests, QuickCheck/SmallCheck properties, and any other tests, into a single test suite. This is achieved by grouping these tests in groups and sub-groups.\nFigure 5: Example of implementing a Test in Haskell using Tasty framework\nIn Plutus, a special package is available for testing our smart contracts, named: Plutus Contract Test .\nTo explore Plutus Contract Tests, we must develop an understanding of the checking predicates of the module Plutus.Contract.Test\nFirst, it s worth defining what a predicate means in Haskell:\nDefinition of a predicate in Hackage:\nA predicate is a function of some value of type a to a Result, i.e. a Bool-like value with Okay as True and Fail as False, which carries additional data in each branch.\nSo, this means we can say that a predicate checks a condition and returns true if the assertions are met, but false if not.\nchecking predicates of the module Plutus.Contract. The test includes a few important functions:\no Function Input types:\nTest Name\nTrace Predicate (see next point 2.2.1.2)\nEmulatorTrace (the same type as used in the manual testing section)\no Function Output type:\nFigure 6: Checking Predicates of the Plutus.Contract.Test Module\nTrace Predicate is simply a predicate on a Trace, which means a function responsible for checking a certain condition on a Trace.\nIn the trace predicate definition, we can notice different combinators of the TracePredicate types (not, (.&&.), (.||.) )\nFigure 7: TracePredicate Type in the Plutus.Contract.Test Module\nSo, this means there are numerous testing predicates available.\nIn our Token Sale contract, we will pick just one, the walletFundsChange .\nBy using this function, we can check, after running the tests, if the wallet funds have changed as predicted in the input Value; this is, of course, excluding the fees.\nThe calculation of fees is complicated.

    "prompt": "Cardano For the Msses Book Review?",
    "completion": "Honestly, I was saddened that the release of Mastering Cardano book was postponed.\nStill, another book called Cardano for the masses , written by John Greene, caught me by surprise.\nWhile reading the title for the first time, my expectations were, honestly, low. I thought this book would describe some silly Cardano concepts. After all, the masses in the crypto as I know nowadays, are concerned more about owning a Lambo than focusing on the real-life use cases of the blockchain technology, as well as its philosophy and long-term vision.\nHowever, upon conducting a deep dive into the book, I was genuinely happy with the quality of work in this piece. It is the first book I can recall covering several in-depth aspects of Cardano, like its philosophy, long-term vision, some technical details, and its ecosystem.\nThe book is available on Amazon and the booktoken.io platform.\nUltimately, I purchased both the paper format and the kindle format. This is despite preferring, in general, to read books on my iPad and sometimes in my desktop browser. Therefore, having a digital library accessible anytime in any place needed represents a crucial element of my knowledge management system.\nAlthough the book boasts 473 pages, it is not too long but still covers all essential Cardano ideas. The book scratches the surface of many technical details, so as not to overwhelm the readers with complex concepts. John Greene, the author, said:\nThis book is mainly for Cardano newcomers. It does not go deep into the weeds of the technical research papers, or explore concepts in great detail. The goal is to give a broad overview of Cardano .\nThe author of the book, John Greene, was unknown to me before I discovered the book. John is a Cardano enthusiast with an outstanding technical background, specifically in cloud infrastructure and security.\nAfter discussing the book with him, and after its proofreading, I found him to be a humble person with a vast understanding of the Cardano protocol, coupled with an impressive vision.\nMeanwhile, both of us firmly believe that Cardano will attract millions of people within a few years, as well as how this book will help with onboarding newcomers and serve as a reference to learn more about this technology.\nThe Cardano book begins by introducing Cardano s origins and the journey of its founder, Charles Hoskinson and the Cardano Roadmap\nImmediately, what caught my attention most was the story of the early days of CH in the crypto space. In the beginning, Charles didn t know where to start and didn t know many people in the space. Hence, he sought advice from one of his old professors who said:\nthose who cannot do teach .\nTaking this advice offered a dramatic shift in CH s life and helped him get involved in the space.\nYou may also notice that various Charles Hoskinson quotes from AMAs on YouTube or Twitter were extensively mentioned in the book. These quotes involve fundamental information about Cardano s philosophy and vision.\nIn the second chapter, the author highlighted Cardano s basic concepts and what distinguishes this blockchain from its competitors.\nIn this section, what I enjoyed the most was the explanation behind some names, like Ouroboros , Plutus , ADA etc\nIn the third and fourth chapters, things become increasingly technical. Here, John Greene describes the basic principles of the proof of stake consensus mechanism.\nThe first-of-its-kind Ouroboros protocol was described in depth, while its role was emphasized in assuring the Cardano network s security and decentralization.\nIn addition, the role of nodes and the contribution of the staking pools in maintaining the network s integrity and security were emphasized.\nIn the fifth chapter, the author explains the extended UTXO model, as well as its advantages compared to bitcoin and the Ethereum account model. CH summarizes eUTXO s capabilities by mentioning in a tweet that this model has the expressiveness of Ethereum with the attack surface of Bitcoin .\nJohn Greene goes on to explain in depth a lot of important concepts related to tokens in Cardano. In this way, all tokens in Cardano are considered native, unlike Ethereum, where tokens should be created using a smart contract.\nIn the next sixth and seventh chapters, Plutus, the programming language utilized to write smart contracts in Cardano, and Marlowe, the domain specific language specialized in writing financial smart contracts, were underlined. However, this was achieved without diving deep into the technical details on how to write smart contracts. IOG s Plutus Pioneer Program was referenced as the primary resource for onboarding developers in Cardano s ecosystem.\nIn the eighth chapter, Voltaire s last era of the Cardano roadmap was thoroughly demonstrated, covering governance and full decentralization.\nThe most important pillars of this era consist of, first, the CIPs (Cardano Improvement Proposals), and second, Project Catalyst. The latter serves as a special source for funding community projects leveraging the Cardano treasury and using a unique transparent on-chain voting system.\nLast but not least, in the ninth chapter, the author went on to discuss the numerous possibilities to scale the Cardano network. These can be classified into two parts. The first is immediate short-term solutions, including some tuning on the actual network parameters and a slight block size increase. Meanwhile, the second includes mid- and long-term scaling solutions, Pipelining, Input Endorsers, Sidechains, Hydra, Mithril and rollups.\nI was so impressed by the quality of the work, but there is further optimization potential. I was honored to serve as one of the book s proofreaders.\nCardano is changing rapidly; therefore, a newer, updated version of the book will be released after each major protocol change, like Hard Fork events. Moreover, the book will evolve with each iteration and edition, just like Cardano does.\nDespite being a Plutus and Atala Prism Pioneer, as well as being active in the Cardano community, especially in Project Catalyst by building PeakChain, the first Connected Cars project on Cardano, and by regularly contributing to essentials Cardano, the book helped me by further consolidating my knowledge. That demonstrates the boundless potential of Cardano. Each and every day, I learn something new about this cutting-edge technology.\nTwitter: @CardanoBook\nWebsite: https://cardanobook.com/\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find the original article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link.\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Testing Plutus Smart Contracts 23?",
    "completion": "To guarantee secure and high-quality smart contracts, rigorous testing strategies should be implemented. These will significantly differ from standard testing techniques typically used in low-risk web 2 applications.\nTesting in Plutus has been be thoroughly covered in the 8th lecture of the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nMy background, which is largely in software quality in test automation, means I was ecstatic to discover the blockchain testing concepts, especially with Plutus.\nIn three Plutus Testing related articles, we will go over special techniques on how to test Plutus smart contracts using the emulator trace, calculate test coverage, the notion of optics and lenses, and Property Based Testing.\nIn the last article, we covered Manual testing techniques of a Smart Contract in Plutus. After that, we presented Tasty Framework in Haskell and Plutus Contract Test (A special package in Plutus for testing Smart Contracts). Both are used for automated tests in Plutus.\nIn this article, we will present the following concepts:\nAssertions\nEmulator Trace Based Tests\nCode Coverage\nOptics and Lenses in Haskell\nWe begin our article by checking the different assertions available for use in our tests.\nYou can find below the Assertions available in the Plutus.Contract.Test Module.\nFigure 1: Assertions in the Plutus.Contract.Test Module\nIn Plutus, a number of test types are supported. This blog post will explain two categories mainly:\n- Emulator Trace based testing (covered in this article)\n- Property based testing (will be presented in the next article)\nNow, we will move on to covering the first Emulator Trace based testing\nAt this juncture, we go back to our code to implement our tests. We begin by coding the tests function from the type TestTree .\nFirst, we have used the checkPredicateOptions . These options are needed to configure the Emulator before running the tests.\nSecond, we indicate the name of our tests. Simple string: token sale trace\nThird, we specify the Predicate: This is the main assertion we should check after conducting the test\nFourth, we define the Trace, which we call myTrace\nFigure 2: tests function implementation\nUsing the Emulator config, we can specify the initial wallet funds.\nFigure 3: EmulatorConfig implementation\nThis function has the main assertions regarding wallet balances in the Emulator Trace. So, we should check these after running the test.\nWe are using the (.&&.) combinator to check the wallet Funds after running our customized Token Sale use case.\nHere, we can see that we have implemented the same assertions as the manual test cases.\nMoving on, we can run the tests using repl after importing the Tasty Haskell Testing Framework and running the defaultMain tests. This is, of course, indicated by the Tasty framework.\nFigure 4: Running Plutus Automatic Tests in the repl using Tasty Framework\nPreviously, all tests have passed successfully.\nMoving forward, we need to check how the test execution results look in case of Failed Tests. And we can manipulate test assertions to enforce test failure.\nHence, we change the expected funds in wallet 2 after running the tests from 20 to 19, which is obviously false.\nFigure 5: Changing the test assertions from the test predicate\nFigure 6: Running Plutus Automatic Tests in the repl using Tasty Framework Case of failure\nWe notice that the test failed as expected.\nWe also get the logs offering details of the test execution results, along with a comparison between the Actual Results and Expected Results.\nPlutus allows us to check the code coverage. Thus, how much code covered by our tests serves as a crucial indicator of our code quality.\nAs described in Figure 6: Checking Predicates (Previous article) of the Plutus.Contract.Test Module , one of the checking predicates functions provided by the Plutus.Contract.Test module is the checkPredicateCoverage function.\nFigure 7: checkPredicateOptionsCoverage function implementation\nNow, we implement the testCoverage function by deploying the mentioned checkPredicateCoverage function.\nFigure 8: Implementation of the test coverage function\nAfter implementing the testCoverage function, we run it in the repl. Once executed, the testCoverage function will save the results in an HTML report.\nFigure 9: Running the test coverage function in repl\nOur test coverage report captures a range of meaningful indicators. This is especially true for the transition function, where we have the core business logic of our use case.\nFor example, the green color code means that the highlighted conditions were always true in our test.\nBut the Nothing is highlighted in Red, meaning our tests did not cover this condition.\nFigure 10: Html test coverage report\nOne critical concept in Haskell needed as part of our Testing framework is Optics and Lenses.\nVarious frameworks in Haskell implement these concepts. Still, the Plutus development team uses the library Lens in Hackage.\nOptics attempts to deal with hierarchical data types. Thus, in this way, we can either read specific data located in one particular hierarchical data type or update it.\nFigure 11: Example of a hierarchical data type\nLars created an example of a hierarchical data type he calls company in the Plutus pioneer lecture. The company includes a staff, which represents another data type called Person , which contains the person s name and address.\nThe main challenge in a hierarchical data type is reading or changing the address of a specific person using a simple, straightforward function.\nBut, Lenses solve this issue. In fact, it provides a concept similar to accessors , which exist in other programming languages like Java, represented by the . symbol.\nFigure 12: Getting and Updating specific data using Lenses\nIn the next article about testing in Plutus, we will present the concept of Property Based Testing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find the original article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link.\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Cardano now has a stablecoin?",
    "completion": "Shareslake has been working hard during the year to open the Cardano technology to those use cases in which the typical crypto volatility is not an option.\nOn May 1st, 2022, the Shareslake network was released as a fork of Cardano. It has the peculiarity to run on top of Redeemable, a fiat-backed stablecoin that is designed to be not just a common stablecoin, but to preserve people purchasing power over time. The Shareslake network supports all the same features as Cardano, but the transaction fees are paid using Redeemable instead of ADA. The Redeemable can be staked just like ADA is on Cardano mainnet and anyone can deploy their own pool and start to earn this new stablecoin.\nRecently, on September 26th, the Shareslake bridge opened its doors, bringing the Redeemable coin to Cardano as the first ever Cardano stablecoin. The bridge allows moving Redeemable between Shareslake and Cardano networks, joining both ecosystems to power the Cardano DeFi landscape.\nCurrently, there are two main ways of obtaining Redeemable. You can mint new Redeemables in both, Shareslake and Cardano networks through the Shareslake dashboard, which adds USD to the fiat reserve and mints the new equivalent Redeemable. When minting directly in Cardano you can also add the reserve deposit using ADA, which will be converted to USD before adding the funds to the reserve. In Cardano, you can also use Minswap, Wingriders or MuesliSwap to swap ADA by RED. When using Redeemable in Cardano always remember to check the policy id: cd5b9dd91319edbb19477ad00cbef673a221e70a17ef043951fc678652656465656d61626c65\ncd5b9dd91319edbb19477ad00cbef673a221e70a17ef043951fc678652656465656d61626c65\nMore information about how the Shareslake bridge works can be found in the Shareslake blog.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Comparison of energy consumption of Cardano and Bitcoin?",
    "completion": "Did you know that Cardano is about 60,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin? Is this important to you? Maybe yes and maybe no. However, this topic is increasingly being debated at the level of governments and regulators. Their decisions may affect the future of blockchain projects. Let's look at the details.\nProtecting the environment is a priority for our planet. For many years, this topic has been overlooked as governments have focused mainly on economic development and technological progress. Ecology has been seen as an obstacle or a topic that can wait a few more years. This is changing rapidly. In Europe, and elsewhere in the world, we are reaching new temperature records. Britain has experienced 40-degree heat. It is also hot in France and some states in the US. The climate is changing faster than we expected. Thanks to negative geopolitical events, the price of energy is rising steeply, and this is at a time when Europe is committed to going green. The green deal is now in jeopardy, but legislators are trying to achieve the goals that Europe has decided to achieve.\nThese, and many other reasons, are leading to a growing debate on the meaningfulness of Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks. While the cryptocurrency community strongly believes that blockchain is revolutionizing the world of finance, not everyone on the planet shares this enthusiasm. We need to look at the issue dispassionately and understand the arguments of people who have not yet grasped the meaning of cryptocurrencies.\nImportantly, the concept of decentralization is not only associated with Bitcoin, i.e. with the PoW consensus. Cardano is proof that Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus is a quality alternative to PoW. PoS in Cardano will celebrate its second birthday in 2022. There are many other PoS networks in the cryptocurrency space that have also been running for several years. No PoS network has yet been successfully attacked.\nShould energy intensity be a barrier to decentralization, the cryptocurrency industry will survive without PoW networks. Bitcoin is a hugely important project for the entire industry and has a lot of backers behind it. On the other hand, the energy intensity of this PoW network is huge and, more importantly, hard to predict. If the value of BTC coins were to increase dramatically in a short period of time, say 100x, the energy intensity would also increase at the same time in the same proportion. If Bitcoin consumes as much energy today as, say, Spain, after such a dramatic increase in the value of BTC coins, Bitcoin would consume as much energy as 100 countries the size of Spain. Even Bitcoin fans have to admit that this is hardly sustainable for our planet.\nWe can also see the other extreme, i.e. that the value of BTC coins will not rise as quickly. In that case, however, the security of the Bitcoin network will decline, as the halving event gradually reduces the number of coins miners receive to cover the cost of the energy they consume. It would be unwise for the world to adopt a network whose security is inadequate. I have seen many successful attacks on PoW networks. A low hash rate was always to blame. PoW networks can't afford for native coins to not permanently grow in value.\nKevin Musgrave and Kevin Musgrave created a tool that shows the security budget of Bitcoin. Anyone can play around with the parameters and see under what circumstances Bitcoin remains secure and decentralized. For example, if you leave the default settings in the tool, i.e. the average fee at $1.50, the block size at 1.20 MB, and set Bitcoin's market capitalization at $100T in 2140 (4,7M USD per BTC), you will find that by 2024 Bitcoin's security will be \"Insecure\" according to Peter.\nWe all know that the overall capitalization of the Bitcoin network is influenced by the big players and banks. If regulations and laws forced these institutions to refrain from investing in Bitcoin, the value of the coins would drop, which would have a dramatic impact on the security of the network. In other words, if Bitcoin is to be secure, it probably cannot do without support from the highest levels of politics.\nLet's not forget the ESG initiative, which can also influence decision-making quite significantly. It is time for the cryptocurrency community to share its views on the future with legislators. Ignorance and disinterest in talking to politicians on this topic can backfire.\nThe energy demand for running PoW and PoS networks is a topic that should be addressed more, not only across the cryptocurrency community but also at the level of politicians and other important bodies. Let's take a look at the energy intensity of Cardano and Bitcoin networks in this article.\nThe energy consumption of the Cardano network is independent of the value of the ADA coins. This means that the power consumption is almost constant regardless of whether it is a bear market or a bull market. The number of nodes on which the pool or relay service runs must be taken into account in the calculation. Even so, the calculation may not be straightforward.\nBased on our live relay analysis, some pools have 5 relays, others share some relays together, others run multiple pools on a single device, some have more relays under one DNS name, etc. Some run failover infrastructure and some have non-public relays. We have tried to factor in an appropriate average of all of these. Our estimation includes all nodes in the infrastructure.\nIf we consider 45W as the consumption of one node, we get the total consumption of the Cardano network by multiplying this constant by the number of all nodes in the infrastructure. At the time of writing, there are 7879 nodes in the network. The annual energy consumption of the Cardano network comes out to about 3.1 GWh. Current data can be found in Cexplorer.\nThe PoW consensus is based on electricity consumption. Unfortunately, the calculation is not so simple, as the power consumption is directly dependent on the value of BTC coins. Since the value of BTC coins is volatile over time, the electricity consumption also rises and falls. Because security is directly tied to the security budget, network security also rises and falls with the value of BTC coins.\nThe hash rate can rise regardless of the energy consumed as the efficiency of ASIC miners increases. This means that even if the price of BTC coins were stable for an extended period, the hash rate would increase. Miners cover the cost of buying energy through BTC rewards. Because the price of energy is different in each country, it is difficult to estimate how much energy miners will purchase.\nThere are several ways to reliably estimate the energy costs of mining. Let's show some of them. It is possible to use a total hash rate and assume that miners have the latest ASIC miners. Miners always try to be as profitable as possible. On the other hand, it is not always economically viable to buy new hardware. So not all miners will have the latest models. Moreover, chips are currently a scarce commodity, so the demand for ASIC miners may not always be met in time. Anyway, if we know what hash rate one ASIC miner can produce, we can divide the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network by the hash rate of one device. This gives us the number of ASIC miners in the network. As we said, one must take into account that part of miners is older. Since we know the cost of running one ASIC device, we can also estimate the total power consumption.\nThe network security budget can also give us a rough idea. If we assume that mining must be profitable, we know that miners will not spend more money on energy than what the network pays through BTC coins. We have to subtract the cost of buying ASIC equipment, labor, the space in which the miners are located, costs related to cooling, fees to pools, profit, taxes, etc. We can calculate the gross cost per day of running a bitcoin network by multiplying the number of rewards per day by the number of bitcoins miners receive in block rewards (including fees), and multiplying the whole thing by the current value of BTC coins. Thus, (6 24) (6.25 BTC + 0.1 BTC) * 20,000 USD. That's a total of $18,288,000.\nIf we wanted more accurate results, we would need to know specific data directly from the miners. Still, we can make a rough estimate. The gross annual cost of running the Bitcoin network is approximately 188,222 GWh at this point, according to our calculations. Our results are consistent with what is published, for example, by statista.com (177 000 GWh) and digiconomist.net (134 000 GWh).\nIf we take the annual cost of running the Cardano network, 1.6 GWh and compare it to the annual cost of running the Bitcoin network, 188,222 GWh, we find that the Cardano network is about 117,000 times more environmentally friendly.\nAs you can see, the carbon footprint of the Cardano network is almost negligible compared to Bitcoin. PoW mining has a very negative impact on the environment and generates 74.76 Mt of CO2 per year, similar to the state of Colombia. A single Bitcoin transaction costs the world 1,491 kWh, which is roughly the cost of running a U.S. household for 51 days.\nThe fundamental argument in favor of PoW is that energy consumption is a prerequisite for securing the Bitcoin network. Time has tested this argument, but it is often forgotten that the rewards process is dynamic. As Peter Todd suggests, the security of Bitcoin is by no means certain and will depend on the growth in the value of the coins. Unchanged monetary policy is a groundbreaking technological advance, but long-term sustainability must not be forgotten. If it's only supposed to work for, say, 20 years, it's not as useful as it first seemed.\nThere is no convincing argument that PoS doesn't work or that it has some fundamental weakness. Both PoW and PoS networks can be attacked. The attack vectors are different. There are several implementations of PoS and none of them have failed yet. It turns out that dependence on power consumption is not necessary. The advantage of PoS networks is that, unlike PoW, they are sustainable in the long term.\nThe security of PoS networks also grows with the growth in coin value, as it makes it more difficult for a single entity to accumulate large numbers of coins. On the other hand, the security of PoS networks also depends on the distribution of coins among users. If more than 50 of the coins were owned by 10M network users who would not sell them due to passive income, an attacker would essentially have no chance to get the necessary majority to attack. At the same time, it would be enough that the value of the coins would not drop dramatically, i.e., they could remain at the same level, and the security of the network would not be fundamentally altered by value drops.\nAssume that all coin holders are honest participants because they have an economic incentive to protect the network. PoW networks have the disadvantage that strong competition can drive honest miners out of the game. In other words, an honest miner may not be profitable and is forced to stop mining. Thus, he cannot participate in the security of the network even if he would like to. This leads to a centralization of power. PoS networks are likely to always be more decentralized as they allow all users to participate in the decentralization and security process. Every player, even the honest whales, protect the network from attack.\nFor the purposes of this article, let's stick mainly to energy consumption.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has released a report entitled \"Mining the environment - is climate risk priced into crypto-assets?\", which looks at the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. The report is well written and detailed.\nThe document says that some crypto-assets have a significant carbon footprint and that this undermines their green transition commitments. Estimates of the carbon footprint for Bitcoin and Ethereum further show that their combined yearly emissions as of May 2022 negate past and target greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings for most euro area countries.\nJurisdictions may also look more closely into the productive use of different energy sources as a result of the recent spike in energy prices following the Russia-Ukraine war. The authors of the paper point out that there is an alternative and much less energy-intensive blockchain technology that can achieve similar results to the energy-intensive ones.\nClearly, the authorities have a well-mapped cryptocurrency space and know the differences between PoW networks and greener alternatives such as PoS. The authors of the paper are aware of initiatives to transition mining to green energy sources. The document mentions the Crypto Climate Accord and the Bitcoin Mining Council.\nWhether we like it or not, we don't think the authorities will be satisfied with the argument that PoW mining can switch to green energy. We must consider that Bitcoin is not the only PoW project and new ones may emerge in the future. To determine the overall negative environmental impact of PoW mining, we need to sum up the consumption of all existing projects. Authorities cannot grant an exemption to one project and ban others. If there is a green alternative to PoW, it is a fair argument that people should use a more environmentally friendly technology.\nFrom our point of view, people should choose what they want to use. Authorities should respect people's choices and not restrict them. On the other hand, awareness of cryptocurrencies is low among the mass population today, and Bitcoin's high energy consumption is criticized by experts and the general public. It is not true that everyone who understands Bitcoin necessarily agrees with its high energy consumption. The population will always be divided in opinion and it is questionable how the authorities should approach this, as it is in their job description to take into account the views of both camps and decide in favor of the majority.\nWe believe that the PoW consensus makes sense if the problem of the declining security budget is somehow resolved. Building network security on the assumption that the value of coins will grow indefinitely doesn't make much sense. The concept of useful PoW, where computing power is used to solve a real problem, is interesting. PoW can play a significant role in securing blockchain networks, but it is questionable whether it will in the form that Bitcoin is currently using it.\nWe understand that people selfishly advocate for their own investment first and foremost, so they feel the need to overlook the needs of other people who don't have skin in the game. There has not yet been a rational and open debate in the crypto-community on the subject of the over-consumption of electricity. We assume that it will not even take place because the different communities are hostile to each other and have no desire to accept the arguments of the other side. Everything is wrapped in false ideology. Frankly, we are not surprised that the authorities have taken up the issue and feel the need to make a decision. We do not like the possible ban on PoW, but we understand the arguments from the document that was published by ECB.\nIf you want to look at the current power consumption of Cardano and Bitcoin and compare it on energy usage estimation page, which updates the data regularly.\nSource: Comparison of energy consumption of Cardano and Bitcoin\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Astarter ISPO Stage1 Launch?",
    "completion": "Following the announcement of the Astarter Launchpool to bring the ISPO component of our two-stage ISPO and Merge Staking Protocol available to projects and users of the Astarter DeFi infrastructure hub on Cardano. We are pleased to announce that the Astarter ISPO stage1 is officially launched at Epoch 366, Sept 27, 2022.\nAs previously outlined, Astarter, as a DeFi infrastructure Hub on Cardano, has a particular interest in ISPO and staking models, not least as projects launching on the Astarter platform may also benefit from our research, development, and participation in this area.\nInitial Stake Pool Offering is short for ISPO. Initial because it is part of the initial distribution of a new token supply. Stake Pool because Cardano stake pools are involved in the process. Offering because tokens are a reward offering to ADA HODLers who delegate their ADA to the stake pools.\nIn the Astarter two-stage ISPO, HODLers who wish to participate can delegate their ADA to the Public Astarter Stake Pool (pool ticker AA1) or Astarter Merge Stake Pools to get AA tokens as a reward with minimal risk. AA token rewards amount depends on the quantity of ADA staked, the ISPO stage, and the epoch duration.\nFollowing our exploration into ISPOs in a series of discussions on different methods of ISPO, we found a lot of community support for ISPOs as a distribution method and for raising project awareness and liquidity. Aligning with the permissionless and trustless nature of Cardano Ouroboros enables a balanced and transparent model of ISPO through the Merge Staking Protocol which includes community SPOs.\nAstarter Public Stake Pool- Stage 1\nThe first stage of Astarter ISPO is a method designed to enable ADA delegators to be rewarded in AA and involves Astarter Public Stake Pool set with a 99 margin.\nThis project-specific stake pool is configured to a 99 margin, meaning 99 of the ADA rewards per epoch minus pool operating costs are pool fees that go towards funding Astarter project liquidity provision in the form of ADA.\nParticipants of the initial offering can delegate any amount of ADA (minimum 10 ADA) to this project-specific staking pool for any chosen duration of the offering. Also, they can un-stake their ADA at any time. AA token rewards are calculated per epoch (5 days).\nStage 1 of the Astarter Initial Stake Offering (ISPO) starts from Sept 27, 2022 (Epoch 366) to Feb 24, 2023 (Epoch 396) for a maximum of 30 Epochs.\nDuring the five months (30 epochs) maximum ISPO stage 1 period, Astarter will distribute up to 500,000AA in rewards to ADA delegators. Delegators will receive an estimated 0.5AA base reward per 1000ADA delegated, with reward calculation taking place per epoch.\nAllocation for the first stage of the proposed ISPO would come from ecosystem allocation, as the ISPO is not a token sale per se, and the ADA generated would essentially feedback into the ecosystem through liquidity provision.\nBonus for early delegators who were delegating ADA from epoch 366 and by 368 for their faithful support towards the Astarter ISPO protocol. There is a three epoch window for users ADA delegation to qualify for the early participation bonus. These users will receive an estimated 0.55AA per 1000ADA, with the reward calculation taking place per epoch from epoch 366.\nPre-ISPO: 1000 ADA/EPOCH= 0.55 AA\nBase Reward: 1000 ADA/EPOCH= 0.5 AA\nUsers delegate for:\n26+ EPOCHs: Full Moon (base reward+20 )\n16 25 EPOCHs: Waxing Gibbous (base reward+10 )\n6 15 EPOCHs: First Quarter (base reward+5\n1 5 EPOCHs: Waxing Crescent (base reward\nOverview\nThe rationale for stage one is that the distribution method encourages ADA staking to an Astarter project-specific pool while generating ADA liquidity provision for the project.\nAA tokens are rewarded based on the quantity of ADA staked, the starting epoch, and the duration. The sooner and longer you delegate, the more AA rewards. The ISPO model, therefore, is closer to a fair launch than any other option, and we think this is particularly exciting as it is native to the core functionality of Cardano.\nThe Astarter ISPO model provides consistent and flexible rewards for delegators. Many Astartees anticipate our ISPO launch. The time for onboarding is now as we begin this exciting adventure. It is without a doubt that Astarter rewards more to those delegators who dedicate more time to us. We hope we can hear more voices from our communities.\nThank you for reading and please stay tuned to Astarter social channels for more updates and announcements of events and activities taking place.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "The next NMKR token distribution events airdrop ISPO?",
    "completion": "We re proud to finally announce the next steps in our NMKR token distribution event (TDE) plans that were initially outlined in our original whitepaper.\nThe next two distribution events can be categorized into:\nAirdrop\nISPO\nAs outlined in the whitepaper, we ve allocated a total of 120m NMKR Tokens (1.2 of maximum supply) to an airdrop. The overall goal of this airdrop is to reward users that have been part of the NMKR ecosystem in the past and to grow the ecosystem by bringing NMKR to more wallets.\nThe airdrop will happen in 3 phases, each phase with a different goal in mind.\nPhase 1: We will be distributing 30m Tokens to everyone who has interacted with the NMKR ecosystem. The goal is to reward active members of the community. To do so, we ve created criteria that indicates who will receive what amount of NMKR Tokens via the airdrop. This criteria will only be announced after a snapshot of the eligible wallets is done.\nTo give you a hint: Everyone who owns one of the over 1.2m NFTs minted using NMKR Studio or NFT-MAKER Version 1 will be eligible to receive some NMKR Tokens.\nThe airdrop will happen in two phases: Claiming & Redeeming. You will have to participate in both phases two receive your Tokens.\nDates:\nClaiming Phase: 14.09.2022 - 28.09.2022\nRedeeming Phase: 29.09.2022 - 13.10.2022\nPhase 2: In this second phase we will be distributing 70m NMKR Tokens. The experience will be similar to the one in the first airdrop, just with more emphasis on the wider Cardano community and our partner projects. Our goal for this airdrop is to reward the communities of the many projects that have worked closely together with NMKR in the past and bring those community members closer to the NMKR ecosystem overall. So the criteria will be different from the one for the first airdrop, and we will bring a variety of partner projects into the airdrop.\nDates:\nClaiming Phase: TBA\nRedeeming Phase: TBA\nPhase 3: After the successful distribution of the first two airdrops, we will work with DripDropz to distribute 20m tokens to the overall Cardano community without any criteria. The goal for this phase is to spread the token far and wide so that we can grow the amount of NMKR holders & community members.\nDates:\nThe second major TDE to look at is the initial stake pool offering (ISPO). We ve outlined a total of 4.8 of all NMKR Tokens to be distributed via our NMKR stakepool over a course of 48 months.\nThis stakepool is already live and running, and even though we haven t officially started the token distribution via the stakepool yet, we ve attracted many delegators that are staking with us and expecting tokens.\nThe major difference between the ISPO and the airdrop is that stakepool distribution is also a funding mechanism for us. We have to consider the amount of money that we re earning through the stakepool and compare that to the number of Tokens we re giving out to the community.\nOn top of that, we can not flood the ecosystem with too many NMKR Coins for a relatively cheap price through the stakepool and crash the price for everyone else.\nWe ve done many calculations and have come to the conclusion that we will need to make changes to our pool parameters and to the way we re distributing the tokens through the stakepool. Simply following what was outlined in the whitepaper is not the best course of action. But of course, it is extremely important to us to honour our commitment to the current delegators.\nBecause of this, we ve decided to do the following:\n1. We ll present you, the NMKR community two possible solutions and explain in much detail and with exact mathematical examples why we believe each of these solutions makes sense to grow the NMKR ecosystem as much as possible.\n2. You will then have the opportunity to decide on one of those two solutions. We will put them up for an on-chain vote, and every NMKR holder can participate in this vote. This will be the very first decentralized act of governance in the NMKR ecosystem and we believe this could be a wonderful precedent for the future decentralization of the NMKR decision-making process.\nBy giving this decision into the hands of the community, we hope that together we can find the best possible solution that everyone will be satisfied with.\nDates:\nDetailed Announcement of ISPO Strategy: 21.09.2022\nOn-Chain Voting: 22.09.2022 - 27.09.2022\nBegin of ISPO: TBA (depends on the voting outcome)\nTo keep up to date with the current announcements, we highly recommend following us on Twitter or joining the NMKR Investors Telegram group.

We are simply educators whose goal is to put in the hands of our students the tools that will enable them to design their own solutions to their own problems. And without fear of admitting it, over time, we have become better and better at it, around a purpose that is stronger than ourselves, a purpose that drives us to encourage, promote and support educational initiatives in line with our values and beliefs, no matter where they occur. Our mission is global.\nOne of these initiatives is the Cardano Hackathon in Argentina (proposal funded by Project Catalyst in Fund 8) that will take place this weekend (September 3 - 4, 2022) at the National Technological University (UTN) in the city of Buenos Aires, to which we have been invited by ADA Solar (organizer), and in which we have gladly accepted to actively participate as sponsors, along with other respected sister organizations of the Cardano ecosystem. This decision was not taken lightly: ADA Solar's strategic plan is to give back to the world the good they have received from Cardano both in the energy sector (their goal: to be Cardano's first solar power plant) and educational (they held the Cardano Summit 2021 in Buenos Aires and have a consistent track record of promoting and executing various educational days on our blockchain).\nIt will be two days of educational celebration that will bring together academics (including the director of the UTN; Dr. Lars Br njes, Director of Education of IOG; Bharat Mallapur, CTO of EMURGO Academy, Robertino Martinez of IOG, the Marlowe team, among others), industry professionals, media in the region, public in general, all around the engine of innovation and creativity of any human enterprise: the students.\nThe location of the event is no less special: Argentina is the representative of a Latin American region that is beginning to awaken as a prominent consumer of blockchain infrastructure, as abundant in social and economic problems as in the potential to see its legacy systems rethought by the change proposed by our technology. A tour of Latin America, from south to north, makes it clear that it is not a question of how, it is a question of when. And that when is clearly taking more and more strength.\nFrom EMURGO Academy we send to the organization and the participants of the event our best wishes, predicting from now on the success of the event. To the winners of the competition our congratulations in advance. Events of this kind contribute decisively to accelerate the understanding and awareness of innovative technologies such as Blockchain. Education has always been a bridge between the fear of the present and the hope for a better future. In the end, the winners are all of us.\nDetails of the event:\nThe two-day Hackathon will be from September 3 to 4, 2022.\nThe opening ceremony will be held in the Aula Magna of the National Technological University (UTN), Buenos Aires Regional Faculty (Av.

    "prompt": "Cardano is the highestranking crypto brand?",
    "completion": "Cardano is highest-ranking crypto brand in the Top Brand Intimacy 2022 report. The surprising thing is that Cardano has a higher rating than Bitcoin. Almost every person on planet has heard of Bitcoin while Cardano is still unknown to the general public. What is it that has earned Cardano such a good rating?!\nThe MBLM Brand Intimacy Study focuses on the biggest brands based on emotion. The rankings use technology tools such as artificial intelligence to assess how consumers connect with the brands they use and like. A strong emotional connection between users and the brand is a key requirement and the basis for the report. The team believes that the higher the emotional connection, the more powerful the relationship with the brand. Positive feelings can be analyzed based on language used during communication.\nThe strength of the bonds is assessed. The depth and degree of intensity of the intimate relationship with the brand are revealed and measured. During the process of building a relationship with a brand, certain phenomena can occur.\nSharing occurs when the person and the brand engage and communicate. This leads to knowledge sharing, which allows users to understand exactly what the brand is and its future direction. Both parties make sure they understand each other and share the same vision.\nSubsequently, a certain level of bonding can be formed and the relationship between the person and the brand can become more meaningful and committed. This is the acceptance stage where trust is established. In this stage, fusing may occur. This requires the person and the brand to be inextricably linked. The identity of the person and the brand begin to merge and become a form of mutual realization and expression. The depth and degree of intensity of the intimate relationship with the brand are measured.\nDisney, Tesla, Apple, SONY, and YouTube were the top 5. Tesla and Apple products definitely have a wide base of loyal fans. Tesla cars are definitely not among the most widely used means of transportation in the world. The difference between Tesla and other car manufacturers is the link between the brand and the users. People who own a different model of car are fans or sympathizers of Tesla.\nIn the mobile phone market, the competition is mainly between Apple and Samsung. It may surprise you to learn that Samsung is ranked as high as 85th. Apple phone owners are proud of the brand and are often willing to stick the company's logos on their cars. Such strong brand loyalty is not evident in the case of Samsung. It could also be interpreted that people perceive Samsung products as consumer goods. The difference is not necessarily about the quality of the products, but about the relationship with the brand.\nThe difference is not about the number of users, but brand loyalty. A brand that has a smaller number of users, but who are loyal to the brand and share a similar vision, may receive a higher rating. In Q2 2022, Samsung had a market share of 21 , while Apple only has 16 . Of course, other products from these brands need to be taken into account. Let's add that the android brand took 10th place.\nIt probably won't surprise you that the top 30 include mainly car manufacturers and brands related to the entertainment industry, computers, and the internet. These are all things we use every day. In addition to Tesla, you'll also find Mercedez, Porsche, Jaguar, Mazda, etc. in the top 30. As for the gaming industry, there are brands like Netflix, Sega, Nintendo, Prime, etc.\nIt is pleasing that cryptocurrencies have made it into the report. Cardano took 26th place. Bitcoin 30th place. It is worth noting that Ethereum took up 120th place.\nAs we have already explained, the report does not take into account the number of people who have ever heard of the brand. It does not take into account the number of users, but the relationship with the brand. That explains a lot. The Cardano community is very engaged and the relationship with the project is very strong. It is important to stress that the community is open and, unlike Bitcoin, is not toxic. Open positive debate, sharing the mission of the Cardano project with newcomers, and the desire to build, are completely different kinds of relationships with the brand than waiting for the value of BTC coins to rise.\nNeedless to say, many people buy T-shirts with the Bitcoin logo and stickers can be found in many places. As far as the project logo is concerned, Bitcoin is definitely the most visible. There are many podcasts and video channels that are dedicated only to Bitcoin. I can't rationally explain why all of this hasn't helped Bitcoin to rank higher. In the case of Bitcoin, I see a lot of positives, but I can't ignore the negatives. That's one possible explanation.\nThe bitcoin community is often concerned only with charts and pursuing the single goal of increasing the value of BTC coins. The debate is often very negative towards other projects, which prevents newcomers from building a strong relationship with the Bitcoin brand. Becoming a maximalist is essentially ignoring technological progress and becoming a fan of a single projection forever. That's a relatively strong commitment that doesn't come naturally in the world of technology or money. Not everyone wants to identify as a toxic maximalist. Unfortunately, key members of the community promote and demand this view.\nMany people desire to become rich and wish to see the value of BTC coins grow. However, they follow their own selfish interests more than Satoshi's original vision. Thus, they may only see Bitcoin as a means to enrich themselves. The Bitcoin community is divided. Former prominent members are leaving Bitcoin and are being publicly disrespected. Protocol issues are being overlooked and not addressed. It's possible that newcomers have doubts about Bitcoin, or aren't entirely convinced that it's the best thing for our future.\nCardano ranked better than Bitcoin because the community shares the vision of the project. The mission is the strongest thing about Cardano. Cardano is not presented as a path to wealth for individuals but is a technology that can help everyone, especially those who need it most. Every cryptocurrency has a speculative component to it. Even in the Cardano community, there are people who are only speculating and want to see growth in ADA value. The view that prevails in public is that the mission of the project is the most important thing, not speculation. I see this as the key difference between Bitcoin and Cardano.\nThe Cardano community believes that an alternative social and financial operating system can be built based on new technologies. Adoption by developing countries is proof that this mission is being slowly achieved. The Cardano community enthusiastically shares the successes of the IOG team and contributes to the success by working on their own projects. From the Bitcoin community, these efforts are viewed negatively and many even talk about scams. They say all we need is Bitcoin. While the first layer of Bitcoin is evolving very slowly and the team is not looking to make major technological changes, Cardano will fundamentally change literally every year. The team is to prepare a new roadmap. The Bitcoin community's reaction to any new technological development is negative, which a rational-thinking person cannot understand. Any effort to change the world for the better is desirable for the majority of the population. Cardano development is not funded by people's taxes, so public funds are not spent. Cardano can be seen as a collaborative effort between the team and the community.\nOriginally published on Cexplorer.io\nLink: https://cexplorer.io/article/cardano-is-the-highest-ranking-crypto-brand\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "8 ways you can start using multisig functionality?",
    "completion": "Did you know that Cardano offers a different approach to smart contracts for security and other operational reasons?\nUnlike other blockchains that use a banking-style account model, Cardano does not have one smart contract calling another in the same transaction.\nCardano smart contracts are used as validators to evaluate logic and decide whether a certain transaction should succeed or not, depending on the conditions set in a contract.\nFor instance, the sender doesn't need any permission for a transaction to work; they can just transfer ADA (or another asset like the NMKR token) from their wallet, and it will be done.\nPermission from the wallet owner is needed to spend ADA from their account, which requires the wallet owner to add a tamper-proof signature to the transaction verifying their identity. This workflow is the same on Cardano, whether it's a single or multisig (multisignature) transaction.\nIn essence, multisig transaction means that multiple wallet holders sign off their assets. As an example NMKR enabled multiple signatories to receive NFTs from a project in one big transaction, which was possible with multisig. Cardano nodes (which are stake pools) validate multisig transactions by looking at input UTXOs (amount of funds in your wallet), finding the addresses that own them, and then looking for signatures corresponding to the input addresses.\nNotably, with the latest advancements by IOG to UTXO (now called extended UTXO), multisig contracts can execute, all without going off-chain, which wasn't the case before.\nNow that we have covered the technicalities let's see how multisig can be used in the real world. Here are our top use cases:\nMultisig can be used to require multiple signers in order to execute a transaction. This can be useful for sensitive transactions. For example, you could create a multisig wallet with the CEO, CFO, and COO as signers. This way, all three parties would have to review and agree on the transaction before it is carried out.\nFor example, a multisig contract could be created that can only be executed if two of three signers agree to it. This could be used to create a voting system or to make sure that all parties involved in a transaction agree to it.\nThis means that a transaction cannot be executed until a certain amount of time has passed. This can be used to create escrow contracts or to ensure that a transaction is not executed until all parties have had a chance to review it.\nA limit order is an order to borrow or lend security (such as an NFT-bond) at a specified price. Limit orders are not executed until the security reaches the specified price. This can protect against market volatility or ensure that a trade is executed at a fair price that x out of n number of signers agree to.\nThis can be used to create a subscription service or ensure that funds are released only when certain milestones are met. Conditions for milestones would then be needed by x out of n signers before execution.\nThis can be used to create a safe investment environment or ensure that only trusted parties can access funds. Conversely, multisig can also be used to create a blacklist of addresses that are not allowed to receive funds from a multisig wallet.\nThis can be used to create voting contracts or to ensure that a contract can only be executed by a majority of signers.\nMint NFTs on-demand and pay the creator in ADA, swap one NFT for another, or trade multiple. One single transaction can cover it all. NMKR Studio can enable you to get there.\nIn conclusion, multisig provides a higher level of security and control for users. It also enables the creation of more complex contracts and transactions. However, they can also add complexity to a transaction because multiple signers are required. For example, a smart contract transaction is better when only 2 signers are required and the transaction needs to be executed immediately.\nOne advantage of using smart contracts over multisig is that they can be programmed to execute immediately when certain conditions are met. However, it is also important to remember that smart contracts can also be complex and may require a higher level of technical expertise to develop, integrate and manage.\nIn the end both, smart contracts and multisig, have their pros and cons; it s just a matter of deciding which is best for your needs.\nGreetings!\nYour NMKR team\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "10 ways NFTs can empower musicians?",
    "completion": "NFTs are unique digital assets that cannot be replicated, making them perfect for representing rights and ownership of creative works. Since Cardano is the most developed crypto project, it has become a breeding ground for new and innovative applications. One such application is how NMKR allows musicians to create and mint their music NFTs. By doing that, artists can own and control their creative works all by themselves and without the need for a middle man.\nIf you are a musician, here are the top ten ways NFTs can empower you and your art:\nWith traditional methods like streaming, it can often be difficult for musicians to know how their music is consumed. By selling their music directly to their fans, musicians can have control over their work. This way, artists can get directly compensated rather than always depending on middlemen like record labels or streaming services.\nUsually it is difficult for artists to find a way to build relationships with their fans. By using blockchain technology artists can interact with their fans directly because NFTs can represent things like concert tickets, meet-and-greet experiences, or even exclusive access to an artist's social media.\nIn the music industry, piracy is a huge problem that can often lead to artists losing a lot of money. With NFTs, musicians can watermark their work and track it online, making it much more difficult for pirates to steal and distribute it.\nUsing NFTs, musicians are in the driver's seat to be assured that they're getting paid a fair price. This is because NFT projects are defined before they are sold - so you, as an artist, decide who is getting what kind of split for each NFT sold.\nWith NFTs, musicians can distribute their work to a wider audience. This is because NFTs can be traded on marketplaces, making it easier for people to discover and listen to new music.\nUsing NFTs, musicians can sell their work to raise money for their projects. People are willing to pay for NFTs that represent something they're interested in, such as an upcoming album or tour.\nWhat if musicians could keep track of their royalties and fees? With blockchain technology, they can! This is because NFTs can represent things like royalties, performance fees, or even just tips from fans.\nWith smart contracts, musicians can manage various aspects of their careers, such as booking gigs or managing merchandise. This is because NFTs are the perfect way to represent things like concert tickets and such. Smart contracts on Cardano work differently than on other chains because a minting provider is needed. That's exactly where NMKR excels as the best minting solution provider in the space.\nThere are many celebrities and well-known artists who have NFTs. They can be conversation starters that can help you connect with other artists, producers, or your beloved community.\nNFTs can help musicians make money while they sleep. Talented musicians can sell their work and continue to earn royalties every time it is sold on a secondary market, even when they're not actively touring or releasing new music.\nTo wrap up, NFTs provide several advantages for musicians: They can help to protect your work, get paid fairly, reach a wider audience, and fund your projects.\nWith a strong vision and imagination, our team at NMKR is not just thinking outside the box, but building it. Our team does not care about money or awards; what matters most is that we make progress towards transforming society through blockchain technology, which will benefit everyone worldwide, not just those within our bubble. That's why we are starting campaigns like the 4+4 interview series on Youtube to share our vision with the world and inspire others to build with us.\nHugs!

    "prompt": "Cardano has the second mover advantage?",
    "completion": "The first mover advantage is no guarantee of ultimate success. Being second is also an advantage, as it is possible to learn from the mistakes of the first, do things differently, more thoughtfully and carefully. Cardano does not have a fundamental disadvantage compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nThe first mover advantage is certainly a relevant phenomenon. When someone invents a brand new product and manages to successfully penetrate the market, others start copying the idea. The first mover has an advantage because its brand is the most well-known at the beginning and it manages to build a strong market position before competitors appear.\nIn an open market, the first mover advantage may only be temporary. Competitors try to undermine this first mover advantage in various ways. This could be a lower price, a slightly different product or service, more aggressive marketing, partnerships, or a different user group.\nThe Bitcoin community likes to claim that Bitcoin has a first mover advantage and therefore no other projects have a chance of success. This view is contrary to what is happening in the market and society. Every product, every service, and every political or opinion movement has an alternative. Monopoly is even considered unhealthy and not beneficial to society. Competition, on the other hand, is healthy because it encourages innovation and pushes for greater efficiency and lower prices.\nBitcoin has its own mission and community. Cardano also has a large community, but the mission of the project is different. While Bitcoin is seen as non-state money or store of value, Cardano is meant to become a global financial and social operating system. Both projects have something in common, for example, they use blockchain and are decentralized. On the other hand, we can find many differences. For example, a different consensus mechanism, Cardano's platform allows third parties to build their own financial applications, which Bitcoin deliberately cannot do.\nBitcoin was first to market, so it has a huge community and its adoption is naturally the highest. Does that mean there shouldn't be competition? Does it mean that it doesn't make sense to develop the original idea further and create something new? People will always create competing projects and innovate. The idea that it can't or doesn't make sense is completely irrelevant. Technological development cannot be stopped. Bitcoin had an advantage in the beginning, but whether we want to admit it or not, it is slowly losing it as new projects innovate and push technological boundaries.\nBitcoin was said to be a slow and expensive database. Cardano uses PoS consensus, so we have a faster and cheaper database. Bitcoin was said to never scale at layer one. Ouroboros Leios will allow much higher scalability than PoW networks. Bitcoin's transaction network can send a transaction unconditionally. Cardano can send a transaction conditionally, which is a fundamental building block that various financial applications can take advantage of. We could go on for a long time.\nIs Bitcoin or Cardano better? Everyone will give you a slightly different answer to this question. Someone will choose the first project, and someone else the second. There will be people who will happily use both projects, each for something different. The cryptocurrency world will not have a single winner that will take over the entire market. In the end, there will be multiple projects. From time to time, one will be replaced by a competitor. This may happen as much to Bitcoin as to Cardano.\nThe only defense to stay in the market as long as possible is to keep innovating. The first mover must keep up with the newer competition. If it doesn't, it risks losing its dominance one day. Google, Meta, Amazon, and all the other giants are carefully maintaining their position through innovation. They are even willing to buy a competing product and incorporate it into their ecosystem. The blockchain world will be the same and will not break out of the established orders of competition in the market.\nYou can often hear the argument that we only need one sound money. It's just that if the Cardano community says that the ADA is going to be a store of value or sound money for them, it will happen. It's natural for merchants to accept BTC at this point. Many accepting other cryptocurrencies alongside it and even stablecoins today. Once Bitcoin breaks ground, others will have easier work to catch up and their adoption will be faster. Merchants will accept whatever customers want to pay with if there are enough of them. Does it bother anyone that BTC will be used by, say, 20 of paying customers and ADA only 5 ? Actually, it doesn't bother anyone and the ratio can change. And maybe with volatile cryptocurrencies, no one will ever be willing to pay and everything will be replaced by stablecoins. This is also a scenario that cannot be ruled out. It is even more likely.\nThe second also has many advantages. For example, it can learn from the mistakes of its predecessors. It is possible to think more and longer about the technology and then implement it well. This will increase efficiency. For example, Satoshi could not use PoS because he could not implement it and it would be a problem to distribute coins among users at the beginning. Today, more than 91 of BTC coins are mined. Satoshi predicted that as BTC coins slowly run out, more money will come into the security budget through transaction fees. This is not happening and no one knows how to solve the problem. PoS is a solution that may be more sustainable in the long run than PoW.\nA platform can collect more fees than a transaction network because it will be more useful. Only utility can generate enough profit to reward those who keep the network running. Another benefit that has recently become apparent is that DeFi will allow coins to be used in financial services. Users of Bitcoin hold BTC coins and if they want to use them for anything other than payments, they have to trust third parties. If the network enables the creation of simple embedded financial services, that's a step forward in utility, which will necessarily encourage adoption.\nThe IOG team was able to assess UTXO, which uses Bitcoin, with the account-based model used by Ethereum. It was possible to compare the two accounting models, find all the advantages and disadvantages, and then choose the better one. The IOG team chose UTXO and expanded on the concept. The result was Extended-UTXO, which is more secure from the developers' point of view and more suitable from the scalability point of view.\nCompared to other PoS projects, Cardano doesn't lock coins for any period of time, you don't need to own a certain high amount of ADA coins to engage in cardano staking, and most importantly, Cardano doesn't have slashing, so ADA holders never lose coins due to operator errors. The whole system is set up to encourage the growth of decentralization. There is a lot of research, effort, and modeling behind staking on Cardano.\nWe could go on for a long time listing the advantages of the second mover. Many small details can ultimately determine success in the market. The second mover has the disadvantage that there are more competitors in the market and every single project is trying to succeed. It is difficult for users to find their way around. It's easy to play it safe and bet on the first mover. However, over a longer period of time, a competitor will emerge that gains the necessary traction. Once Bitcoin gains say, a 60 market share, many tech enthusiasts will start trying new things. A new project will emerge that will have a similar status to what Bitcoin had in the beginning. This is quite natural human behavior. Is this project Cardano? We dare not say, because it is too early to tell. If Cardano stays in the top 10 for another 5 10 years, it will be more than certain that the project has established itself in a competitive environment and has enough users.\nThe adoption of Bitcoin essentially helps all competing projects. We already mentioned that once merchants start accepting BTC, over time they will start accepting other projects like LTC, ETH, and ADA. The same applies to investment funds. Bitcoiners are laughing that some fund is only buying BTC and not other projects. Where is it written that these funds won't be buying others in a year? Actually, it's already happening. Very few institutions are buying only BTC these days. Even the most conservative funds are buying BTC and ETH. It is natural to be aware of the competition and recognize it early. Cardano is slowly gaining attention and this will continue. However, Cardano is not about investment funds that buy ADA. Cardano is a platform for people.\nFinancial applications or Web3 services can be created on Cardano that can use tokens and decentralized identity. Once these services succeed, it will be a success for Cardano as well. All it takes is one successful NFT collection and more people will know about Cardano. All it takes is one globally successful decentralized application and Cardano will be talked about everywhere. Almost everyone has heard of Bitcoin and no one will be surprised by its existence in the future. Cardano has the advantage that brand new things will be popping up on it almost all the time. Cardano can be used in finance, gaming, Web3, and other industries. Cardano will surprise people all the time because it will allow people to unleash their potential.\nThe Java programming platform itself is boring and nobody (except programmers) cares much about it. Yet Java applications are used by many people every day. Users don't know what the applications they use are built on. The teams and companies that built the applications for people had to invent a business model. The Java platform allowed companies to implement and monetize their ideas. This fate now awaits all smart contract platforms, including Cardano.\nBeing the second mover was an advantage for Cardano as the team couldn't just copy the original idea of Bitcoin. It had to come up with something more complex that would allow for more things. This was accomplished. The team has the capacity to continue to develop and innovate the technology. This will keep it in the market for a long time to come. In fact, it's at the very beginning of its trajectory.\nPeople like to believe the idea that Bitcoin will never be beaten because it was the first. This is only true in the sense that there will not be an exact second Bitcoin created at the same time as Bitcoin and under the same conditions. The rest is completely open and no one can see into the future. Being second, third, or fourth is not as big a disadvantage as some people believe. In fact, it can even be an advantage, as something completely new will be created that will develop the first idea. People are the ones who will use the networks and only adoption will determine success.\nBitcoin has a strong market position. Cardano and a lot of other projects do not aspire to beat Bitcoin in market capitalization. The Bitcoin community likes to condemn other projects, but if they studied what these projects are aiming for, they would understand that they are no competition for Bitcoin. Can the platform beat Bitcoin in the market capitalization? It's the same question as whether Google or Amazon can beat gold in capitalization. In the end, it doesn't matter, because gold and the giants named above have a completely different mission. Gold, Bitcoin, Amazon, and Cardano all have their place in the market.\nIt definitely makes sense to build Cardano and other projects. People will never agree on a one-size-fits-all solution to use forever anyway. Humanity will always be divided into multiple camps. Even if Bitcoin were to become money, it would be healthy for it to have competition. If we want to have decentralized money, we also need to have decentralized financial services. But that's just our opinion. Those, who only want to have decentralized money can use bitcoins. Those who no longer want to trust unreliable and inefficient intermediaries can use financial services on Cardano. Both are a benefit to humanity regardless of their market capitalization.\nOrigin source: https://cexplorer.io/article/cardano-has-the-second-mover-advantage\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Kachina privacypreserving smart contracts?",
    "completion": "Smart contracts present a standard approach to expressing complex interactions between two or more parties willing to exchange currencies or data in a decentralized way. Smart contracts are effectively automated digital agreements on a blockchain. Written in code, they can track, verify and execute the binding transactions of a contract when predetermined conditions are met. To create a smart contract expressing such conditions, developers use programming languages. The contract code is stored on, and distributed across, a decentralized blockchain network, making it transparent and, if desired, irreversible.\nIn this blog post, we discuss Kachina a privacy-preserving smart contract solution developed by Input Output Global (IOG) in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh. It enables users to achieve privacy-preserving and general-purpose smart contract functionality without sacrificing decentralization characteristics.\nThe transparency and public settings of most smart contract ledgers make contract conditions visible to everyone. While transparency is one of the strongest advantages of blockchain technology, privacy remains essential for applications working with sensitive data.\nDevelopers can use several cryptographic techniques to ensure increased privacy in smart contracts. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and secure computation are two examples. Motivated by such cryptographic techniques, several solutions satisfying various definitions of privacy and requiring trust assumptions appeared. Examples include Zexe, zkay, Hawk, Zether, Secret Network, and others. The most expressive of these solutions, Hawk and Secret, rely on trust assumptions, significantly limiting the level of decentralization that they could achieve. Hawk assumes a small, fixed set of participants at the core of the system, while Secret relies on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), a technology with an extensive history of privacy-damaging attacks. These techniques fundamentally clash with the basic principles of a decentralized blockchain platform.\nKachina identifies a large class of distributed computations expressible as smart contracts with privacy guarantees, which developers can implement without additional trust assumptions.\nA smart-contract protocol relies only on zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (ZK Snarks) to provide privacy. The privacy guarantees of this protocol are proven in the Universal Composability (UC) security framework through mathematical modeling and proofs. The protocol s primary goal is to provide a sufficiently low-level and general-purpose basis for further privacy-preserving systems without requiring the underlying system to be upgraded with each new extension or change.\nKachina allows contract authors to bridge the gap between the blockchain and users local machines these are represented through two independent states, a public and private state, respectively. A contract can update both the on-chain (and shared) public state and the off-chain (and local) private state together. Parties then prove in zero-knowledge that they update the public state in a permissible way: they provide details on a private state's existence and inputs for which this update makes sense.\nKachina contracts also ensure:\nConcurrency in a privacy-preserving manner. Kachina achieves greater concurrency through the novel concept of state oracle transcripts. These are records of operations performed on the contract s state that interact with oracle queries. Contract authors can optimize conflicting transactions, ensuring minimal leakage while still allowing reorderings.\nEfficient modular construction. Kachina is designed to be deployed at scale. Previous works using zero-knowledge do not explicitly maintain a contract state. Kachina allows access to the state indirectly through oracles specified by the contract. This indirect access ensures greater scalability, and as a result, the complexity of what must be proven is under the full control of the contract author and can be optimized.\nIn the research paper, IOG demonstrates the versatility of the Kachina protocol in the case study of private payments. The team formally specifies a private token contract through its transition and leakage functions. This contract supports private fund transfers, balance queries, and asset creation.\nWhile the proposed design is mostly theoretical, Kachina proves the possibility of creating privacy-preserving smart contracts under real-life constraints:\nThe use of state oracles allows moving most computationally hard or storage-intensive operations outside the zero-knowledge proof, which reduces its cost.\nWhile the zero-knowledge proof system must still be universal, ZKP constructions exist and are practical to use in the proposed setting.\nFor more details, examples, and contract samples, read Kachina Foundations of Private Smart Contracts .\nI d like to thank Thomas Kerber for his input and support in preparing this blog post.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Debunking myths surrounding ADA price fluctuation you are a Project Manager, not a speculator?",
    "completion": "The current price fluctuation in ADA has generated much concern and a state of helplessness among my colleagues at Catalyst and the community at large in the face of the loss of value of their funded proposal budgets.\nThe purpose of this article is to present from an Efficient Market Theory* point of view, simple arguments that can provide project managers and proposal executing teams with a better view of the current developments in the field of price oscillation in the market in general, and in the cryptocurrency sector in particular, promising from the start that this will not be the first nor the last time a similar situation will take place.\nIntentional ignorance or natural aversion to certain types of knowledge is disregarded for the consequences when they show up in our lives and sabotage our well-intentioned creative efforts. Situations such as those we are currently experiencing as project implementers at the level of price volatility, where we feel a complete loss of control, call for us to begin to educate ourselves financially and give budget management its position as a key element in designing our proposals.\nVolatility, the driving force behind the aggressive price movements, is just that: a force of nature. And it is a force of nature because it arises from the millions of human interactions that occur at the market level every day. It's not just greed, or ambition, or big fish eating little fish, or a bunch of little fish wanting to be a big fish: it's all of those things at once, with the random dynamics that those situations create.\nMarket dynamics are random. There is no economic model on the planet, not even the ones that are financed with the money that can buy the best talent, the best technology, the best friends, that is able to efficiently predict what the market is going to do in the short and long term. Completely unpredictable in my opinion. However, unpredictability is not synonymous with opacity: market dynamics are available to anyone who wants to study and understand them beyond the popular \"buy low and sell high\", beyond the possible predation and advantage of a few, so famous in the 80's but reduced today (more than those few would like to recognize) in today's liquid, dynamic and efficient markets.\nIn today's liquid markets, opportunities for manipulation are rare. Professionals and institutional money still exist, and of course, their motivations remain the same. However, a cryptocurrency market of over a decade of legitimate existence despite multiple attempts at dismissal and demise (with a market cap approaching $3 trillion USD last year, $1.5 trillion this week) is evidence enough of the difficult conditions in which the Buffets, Dalios, Diamons, Roubinis, Ackmans, Bernankes, Yellens or Powells of the world find themselves when it comes to navigating with the old playbook a changing, efficient and constantly moving market like the current one.\nPrices move. This is a fundamental truth. They move, at times, to the point of eliminating companies and disappearing investments. A complete depuration process so similar to that which occurs in other natural systems that it would be unfair not to give the benefit of the doubt to the possible occurrence of a virtuous circle of elimination of excesses, intolerable for bad companies and imprudent investments.\nMarkets move, things change. The following should be known about price fluctuations:\nPrices move, but they do not do so perpetually in one direction only: they stop their movement, enter in an erratic directionless state, or sometimes simply take the opposite direction.\nAlthough it may not seem so, 95 of price movements (2 Standard Deviations) are covered by a probability distribution:\nImages: tastytrade.com\nThe remaining 5 ( 2SD) is made up of outcomes that cannot be predicted, extreme movements outside of any mathematical model. They tend to do the most damage in situations of improper accumulation of risk. This 5 is known as Tail Risk.\nWhat makes the probability distribution relevant is the fact that it is the template used by the so-called market makers to set the prices that in the form of a premium will be paid by the buyers of financial derivatives (options) and charged by the sellers of those derivatives: the buyers buy from the sellers the right to hedge their risk of loss in the face of an unexpected event (such as the current market crash, in which everything falls at once), the sellers charge for giving the buyers that right. The spread between bid and ask prices is where the profit of these market makers arises, which accumulates daily by billions of dollars through the occurrence of millions of daily transactions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the gigantic amounts of money that cutting-edge technology organizations such as Virtu, Two Sigma or Citadel generate on a daily basis must necessarily be backed up in models with the best brains and the best technology on the planet behind them.\nRemark: of course, the unbiased normal distribution shown above is almost a clich . In the reality of markets it is usual to find distributions whose probabilities are more skewed to one side than the other, i.e., where one thing is more likely to occur than the other:\nImage: Skew normal distribution. Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skew_normal_densities.svg)\nThis situation is immediately reflected in the prices of derivatives, as can be seen in the following example:\nImage via tastyworks.com\nThis stock, close to $560 usd in the public market, assigns different prices (different premium) to derivatives that are at equal distance from the $560 usd mark: $20 usd down the price of the derivative is $7.65 usd, $20 usd up the price is $6.35 usd. The price difference in the derivative premiums, at equal distance, indicates that the stock is more likely to go to $540 than to $580. If a review is made of the prices of the derivatives at greater distances on either side of the $560 usd mark, it is possible to conceive the shape of the probability distribution of the prices of that particular stock. In addition, it is possible to establish with a good probabilistic certainty (1SD) what the range of price movement will be over a specific time period (+-$33 usd in 23 days, see orange boxes at the top of the image).\nTwo are the invitations I make through this article:\nDo not base your conclusions on the information provided by the news: it is a useless and exhausting exercise. The \"talking heads\" in the news and the bombastic internet headlines are only delayed indicators of scenarios that are already baked into prices. There is not a drop of future in them and a lot of noise with an agenda behind it. If this were not the case, the cryptocurrency industry would have disappeared more than a hundred times over by now.\nWhen you get your budget badge, you are faced with three paths, or three gates as in the Monty Hall problem: the ADA price stays in a stable range (about 1:1 with the usd), the ADA price rises well above the stable range (in which we all pop open the champagne to celebrate), the price falls well below the stable range (in which we must cut wages, delay payments, reduce the quality of our product, and start blaming the market and the fat cats as a relief medicine). Two of those doors are the way to paradise (in them the concentration on creative work remains undisturbed and at a peak level), while the occurrence of one of them means a punch right in the face (we start to distribute our concentration between the not-so-creative work and the noise of financial news headlines).\nFaced with this situation, with your proposal's budget badge in one hand and a lottery ticket with a 68 probability in favor (1 Standard Deviation - see \"Standard Deviation in Options\" graph above) in the other, you must make the visceral effort to remind yourself that, above all else, from that moment on, you are a project manager and not a speculator. Therefore, you must look for ways to protect the value of your project budget by giving up price hikes altogether in exchange for protection against price drops. One such way is based on the use of stablecoins such as Djed whose algorithmic design uses smart contracts to ensure price stability.\nRemember: as a manager of a funded proposal you can hedge the risk on your budget 95 of the time, because robust mathematical models (best talent, best technology) account for 95 of everything that is possible. The remaining 5 does not happen often (only 5 of the time). However, when it does occur, it is usually an existential threat unknown in magnitude and duration to any funded project or proposal that has not taken the appropriate steps from the very beginning to protect the value of its financial resources. Conversely, those teams that from the start have foregone speculative price spikes in exchange for protection against market downturns (that unknown 5 whose effect drives the price of everything down with no place to hide), are in a better position to withstand the blows of market randomness and survive to fight another day.\n(*) In general terms, the Efficient Market Theory refers to the fact that all known information is reflected in the price at any point in time. While it is true that there is never a shortage of financial theories, it could be said that this theory in particular has important similarities with Cardano: it is in the top five list of the most important ones and has proven itself after surviving violent financial wars: the Black Monday of 1987, the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.P. (LTCM) in 1998, the dot-com bubble of 2000, the crash of 2008, the flash crash of 2010, the market crash of 2020, among others.\nThis article is based on the insights of veteran floor traders, with over 40-year careers to date, who began putting it into practice on the sweaty, noisy floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and watched it evolve into the digital world. To them, Tom Sosnoff and Tony Batista (www.tastytrade.com), my thanks for providing me with the missing piece (actually, the whole puzzle) in understanding market dynamics after more than 12 years of study.

    "prompt": "The new digital economy is emerging on Cardano?",
    "completion": "In 2015, it was common to say that it was a pity that there were no decentralized exchanges and sandboxes where people could test new concepts. New protocols are emerging on the Cardano platform that people are using to interact with each other. How to understand this and what direction can it take?\nShortly after Bitcoin's inception, there was no infrastructure. The first centralized exchanges made it easy to buy bitcoins and other emerging cryptocurrencies. After the exchanges, other centralized services began to emerge that took advantage of the hype around cryptocurrencies. The first big hacks began to occur. A few owners of centralized services took advantage of their position to steal user deposits.\nA key principle of the blockchain industry is decentralization. It was logical that people started calling for decentralized exchanges and other financial products. It didn't make sense that people could own cryptocurrencies and not be able to do anything sensible with them unless they wanted to take the risk of entrusting them to a third party.\nPeople wanted peer-to-peer services. Open-source algorithms were supposed to play the role of intermediary for more complex financial transactions. This seemed like a big technological challenge at first. One of the first attempts in 2017 was atomic swaps, which allowed tokens to be exchanged between two blockchains. This technology has not taken off. Soon after, the first DEXes appeared on smart contract platforms. You can deploy your own app on Cardano from 2021. In the same year, the first DEX MuesliSwap was launched on Cardano.\nNote that it took approximately 8 years from the inception of Bitcoin before the first swap was attempted. Sometime in 2018, the first decentralized exchanges started to appear. In order to link two blockchains together and allow them to interact, a blockchain bridge is needed. If you own bitcoins and want to participate in DeFi's activities in the Cardano ecosystem, a blockchain bridge will allow you to do so without having to sell your bitcoins.\nThere are DEXes running on Cardano that allow you to swap ADA, USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH, and other tokens. Everything is decentralized, and there's no need to trust a centralized third party with the private keys to your coins. All you need is a Cardano wallet to access all of Defi's services.\nIn the Cardano ecosystem, no one has to ask anyone for permission to build a decentralized application. Once the application is deployed, anyone can use it without permission. No one has to provide KYC/AML or other private information. It doesn't matter where you are from or what your intentions are. The community demands that third-party applications be open source. Experts can judge the quality of the source code and alert the community if they have any doubts about the quality of decentralization or security.\nCentralized exchanges demand private information from users, can monitor their activity, and abuse their position. The biggest risk is that users' deposits can be stolen by hacked or by the CEO.\nToday, it is no longer necessary to take this risk. Decentralized applications offer similar services to centralized ones. Blockchain networks do not yet scale well enough to meet the demand of the hundreds of millions of users who have accounts on centralized services. However, the IOG team is working diligently on the scalability of the Cardano protocol. Be sure to go check out Defi on Cardano.\nDefi is exactly what bitcoiners and other fans wanted to have. We still want to create a parallel financial system that is as self-sustaining as possible and in which new economic models will emerge. As soon as a team deploys their app, people immediately come and use it. This creates new communities that want to use decentralized services more than traditional banking ones.\nIt's perfectly normal for some attempts to fail. Cryptocurrencies are a new environment that is not sufficiently regulated. It's logical that some people will try to scam someone. Scams happen in the real economy too, regardless of the laws.\nDecentralization solves one fundamental issue. It does not matter the character of the person who deploys a decentralized application. As long as the application is well written, and the community can verify this for itself, even the author of the application cannot abuse his position and change the fundamental rules in the application. The decentralized world has the potential to create better conditions for users than what the banking system offers.\nMany bitcoiners criticize NFTs as completely useless tokens. Satoshi wished they would use bitcoins in games. He even suggested creating a virtual poker game that would be part of the bitcoin protocol. The reality is that nobody can predict exactly what will happen in the NFT industry. We certainly wouldn't dare to say that they will disappear completely. In any case, whatever their fate, they have an important role to play in the blockchain industry. New marketplaces are emerging where people are trading tokens. This improves the quality of these services. People can criticize things that don't work. Teams can fix and polish the flaws. This will one day get us to a stage where there is a decentralized marketplace for digital items.\nToday tokens are images, but in the near future, they could represent pretty much anything. Even in the case of the internet, no one has predicted exactly how a particular technology will change the world. Sometimes it takes several things coming together to create something that will turn an industry upside down.\nOur feeling is that bitcoiners are envious that decentralized services are emerging on Cardano and other platforms. Basically, nothing substantial has emerged around Bitcoin when it comes to decentralization. When people wanted to get a reward for providing bitcoins and didn't trust Defi, they had to entrust them to centralized services like Celsius. Celsius went bankrupt and ironically did nothing but using the entrusted funds in Defi services. If bitcoiners weren't afraid of Defi, they would still have their bitcoins under control in services that are transparent.\nBitcoin is not important to Defi. Defi needs neither BTC coins nor the PoW security of the Bitcoin protocol. The native coins of the various protocols, on which Defi services are built, play a much more important role. ADA is used to determine the value and as payment for digital objects. In the Cardano ecosystem, you can buy NFT with ADA, not with BTC. It's similar to all the other platforms, which together are used by tens of millions of people. People buy and sell things, lend money to each other, provide liquidity, and even set up new decentralized organizations. People can even financially support the creation of new projects and become their owners through tokens. Is everything automatically a scam just because it doesn't arise around Bitcoin? That's a pretty naive view of the world.\nThere will probably never be a Defi around Bitcoin that gets the traction it needs. It seems that the community doesn't even want it, or relies on the second layers who can't do it yet. New digital economies are emerging around smart platforms like Cardano.\nSome people don't believe that Defi is a real and viable business. It's healthy to be skeptical. But it is necessary for them to accept reality. For many people, denial is just posturing. It has nothing to do with skepticism. They are in a phase of denial that necessarily precedes the phase of acceptance.\nWhen you consider that Defi has only been here for a few years the adoption rate is incredibly fast. We even think adoption is faster than Bitcoin adoption. We don't think that overnight this whole industry is going to disappear for no reason. Technological progress is noticeable every single year. There are hundreds of people working on Cardano. Don't expect new decentralized banks to appear tomorrow or the day after. In 10 years or so, they will almost certainly be here. People have little patience and would like everything now. Technology development and adoption take time on the order of years, not months.\nPeople in Defi are taught to use ADA coins, which have a fixed monetary policy and are not subject to endless inflation. The question is what role stablecoins will play in this. As for algorithmic stablecoin, cryptocurrencies including ADA will be used as the underlying asset. This means that all users will be in control. No more stable coins will be created unless the necessary amount of ADA coins is locked. Mankind has never had such transparent and fair monetary systems as the blockchain industry offers.\nDefi is still a small industry compared to the traditional world of finance. We are still waiting for a pivotal moment, maybe a few smaller moments, that will draw the masses to Defi. Lending on a decentralized platform needs to be a usable alternative for ordinary people on the street. This can happen with the help of current financial institutions that compete with each other, so they are motivated to try new things. A conventional bank and a decentralized service are not two mutually exclusive things. Even a bank can deploy a smart contract that no one can subsequently change. Bankers can thus be useful assistants who will not be able to abuse their position.\nCardano has a certain advantage because it places a high emphasis on application security. Learning Haskell/Plutus may be a hurdle for some, but if we want to create reliable services, formal verification is a necessity. For financial institutions, the quality of application source code is an absolute priority. Cardano will appeal to anyone who wants to build secure and reliable applications for the masses. It could be banks and FinTech startups, but it could also be you.\nPeer-to-Peer interaction between users is a concept that is fundamentally independent of the blockchain. When two people exchange cash for goods face-to-face, it is a Peer-to-Peer interaction. Blockchain brings this model to the digital world, so it works remotely and is not required to be face-to-face. It can even work largely anonymously. Blockchain is an intermediary that acts as a trusted intermediary between participants. This principle is not limited to Bitcoin.\nIn terms of functionality, Bitcoin is basically just a transaction network that can do nothing else. Cardano allows financial services to be built on top of the transactional network that can operate without an intermediary. If you use DEX on Cardano to exchange ADA for USDC, it's a more secure way than using the Binance exchange. A lot of people have figured this out. More will join soon. Decentralization is the future of finance regardless of the specific protocol.\nBrought to you by cexplorer.io cardano explorer.

    "prompt": "PeakChain Ridesharing Platform Uber on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Ridesharing companies like Uber offer a significant mobility solution for millions of global users.\nThe market size of ridesharing services is increasing worldwide: in 2021, this was 58 billion USD, to an estimated 185 billion USD in 2026 .\nThe demand for cost and time effective mobility solutions justifies the massive number of ridesharing users. These figures are estimated at more than half a billion in 2021; meanwhile, users of such services are spread across 85 countries.\n1.1 Privacy issues:\nSensitive user data like travel trajectory and personal data could be tracked or abused by the service provider. However, through the use of the Blockchain, all user data will be hashed and remain safe. This means only permitted actors have the right to decode such data using their private keys.\n1.2. Security challenges\nUser data is stored in centralized servers, which leaves it open to hacking or manipulation. But a decentralized solution will address this issue. In fact, the Cardano blockchain, as a platform, and by design, will ensure the security of this mobility solution: there is no single point of failure.\n1.3. High fees:\nUsers are paying high fees to service providers. Still, the impact of these fees could be lessened through a decentralized solution.\nIn fact, most blockchain industry DApps represent serious competition to similar centralized solutions. This is due to cutting centralized management and governance costs, as well as the business model transparency.\n1.4. Governance:\nThe problem of all Web2 solutions, such as Uber, is that they are managed by centralized entities. Sadly, this can lead to an abuse of power and the enforcement of any rule changes without warning this could include, for example, fee changes.\nBlockchain solutions mean we can build decentralized solutions which could be governed exclusively by the service users. So, users could suggest improvements in the platform. Such improvements should be formulated in an improvement proposal and voted by the community.\nWe will build the entire solution:\n2.1. Building the platform:\nUsing our experience as a software development company, we can comfortably conceptualize and build any Web Application. We will design the solution architecture and build both the web application and apps (Android/iOS).\n2.2. Conceptualize the economic model:\nLooking at present centralized ridesharing solutions, we will look to create and deploy an economic model that provides true value and competitivity to users one way we will do this is through a Cardano native token. The project s first phase will, therefore, propel users to utilize the platform, as well as refer other users, expanding the customer base.\nUltimately, we plan to ideate and then develop the solution s Tokenomics. Then, we will host discussions with our community concerning whether to pursue an ICO or ISPO. This will only happen when the technical capabilities have been readied.\n2. 3. Building the community and Marketing activities\nBuilding the community is one major success factor of the solution. We will focus on building a sustainable community by incentivizing users and solution contributors.\n2.4. Test the solution with real users\nUpon completing the technical solution, we will proceed to test through various global users, beginning with our location in Germany. We will incentivize the first testers and users of the solution and communicate the testing experience and reports, and marketing campaigns.\n2.5. Embed the Hardware to assure the decentralization of the solution\nOnce the hardware device described in the proposal is ready, we will integrate it with the platform to assure the decentralization of the solution.\nThe blockchain solutions for the automotive sector must be real Web3 decentralized solutions. Furthermore, no centralized servers should interrupt the vehicle data that is transmitted to the Blockchain.\nUnfortunately, currently, several Blockchain solutions are claiming to be real Web3 solutions. Still, the truth is that such solutions are fully centralized and utilize Web2 that is masked behind Web3 marketing. These tools are managed by centralized entities. Moxie Marlinspike s recent blog post dives further into this problem in the blockchain industry using concrete examples.\nMeanwhile, though, PeakChain is focusing on configuring a genuine Web3 outcome for the vehicle industry. This way, centralized servers cannot be hacked or interfered with. At the same time, there will be no centralized entity management.\nAs a sector, mobility is one of the world s largest, fastest-growing. This is indicated by market size and the increasing user numbers.\nWe are homing in on a huge target audience by building a ridesharing solution on Cardano. In fact, as mentioned previously, the number of ridesharing users is estimated by more than half a billion in 2021, and the user base is spread in over 85 countries. As such, there is expected to be significantly increased demand in the number of Cardano Wallets and transactions, as well as the demand of ADA. The Cardano native Token, used to pay fees, will create this huge demand for ADA.\nUltimately, this will lead to increased demand for the Cardano blockchain and boost both retail and institutional adoption.\nOriginal article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link\nCheck our educational content under this link\nTo Support our educational content and contribute in the Success of PeakChain Automotive Solutions, we appreciate delegating to our PeakChain Pool, Ticker: [PKCP]\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "PeakChain Cardano Car Wallet Device?",
    "completion": "Today, the mobility sector is one of the most prominent, as well as fastest-growing, sectors worldwide, when judged by size and user numbers. Nonetheless, increasing vehicle connectivity constitutes rising privacy and security problems. All vehicles connect to centralized servers by sending sensitive data to manufacturers or mobility service providers servers.\nHowever, the automotive and mobility sector is aware of the current issues faced. Hence, several articles and research papers have been published to address this challenge. In these papers, Blockchain s role is emphasized in ensuring secure, private IoT vehicles.\nStill, there are no hardware devices that securely communicate with the Cardano blockchain. PeakChain, the Connected Car Solution Provider on Cardano, will develop a hardware device connecting cars to the Cardano. This is accomplished by sending sensitive data to the Blockchain and managing the vehicle wallet.\nPeakChain device, as mentioned above, will help unlock innumerable mobility solutions for exclusive Cardano Blockchain use. Ultimately, this will lead to increased demand for the Cardano blockchain and boost both retail and institutional adoption.\nBelow are some of the application domains of the PeakChain device.\n1- Remote Software Update:\nGiven the rapid digitalization and proliferation of vehicle connectivity, the number of ECUs (Electronic Control Units) embedded in each Car is growing at a significant pace.\nECUs contain software that should be continuously maintained and updated. That way, fix bugs can be applied while features can be enhanced.\nThe firmware update process could be done by driving to a service center and flashing the software manually, or through a remote software update.\nThe remote software update represents one of the biggest security challenges in the automotive industry.\nSimilar to Tesla, one current solution is using a VPN. Still, the long-term solution should be by connecting cars to the Blockchain using a dedicated device and performing the updates in a decentralized way.\nThus, a hardware component with vehicle connectivity and which receives ECU update instructions through blockchain transactions, but without a centralized manufacturer server in use, is integral. This approach will reduce the malicious actors attack surface.\n2- Insurance\nCar Insurance companies are willing to offer customizable insurance contracts based on their customers driving behavior. Nonetheless, such driving behavior contains sensitive content that should be collected directly from the car, like speed, braking behavior, etc..,\nHence, a hardware device is needed to collect these sensitive data directly from the vehicle, hash it and transmit it securely to the Blockchain.\nJust the allowed actors could decode the driving data existing in the Blockchain using their private keys.\n3- Electric Vehicles\nThe proliferation of electric vehicles is incredibly fast. Still, all data is managed in a centralized manner examples of these include the car manufacturers or charging station service providers servers. Obviously, though, all vehicle data should be managed by the charging service provider platforms for charging electric cars.\nTo help enable a smooth charging user experience, automatic vehicle charging should be adapted based on the customer s need and their typical preferred journey habits. Consequently, the car should interact with other IoT devices like a smart home. Special hardware embedded in the car is, in this use case, essential for secure and private data communication through the Blockchain\n4. Car-sharing Services\nCar-sharing services, similar to other mobility sectors, are increasing rapidly. However, currently, central entities manage payments, contracts, and customer/car data. This leads user data open to being tracked and abused.\nTo alleviate security and privacy issues, customers should ultimately communicate and exchange with the car, as well as pay, in a complete peer-to-peer manner utilizing the Blockchain. To complement this goal, dedicated hardware that is decentralized, private, and secure should be rolled out.\nWith all the above in mind, we will implement the car-sharing use case in our proposal submitted in fund 9: PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\n5. Fleet Management services\nLogistic companies must monitor fleets to reduce fuel consumption and optimize driving behavior and trajectory. Fleet management data is vital for developing a business. This data should always remain confidential, as security or privacy concerns could impact competitiveness.\nAlso, there is the need to manage the fleet data through the Blockchain using special vehicles-embedded hardware this device will be capable of retrieving and transmitting the needed data.\nWe will implement the Fleet-Management use case in our proposal submitted in fund 9: PeakChain Fleet_Management Platform\n6. Ridesharing/Ride-hailing services (like Uber)\nThe ridesharing services market size is growing worldwide. However, much like car-sharing and fleet management services, users should control their data entirely. The data retrieved from the car and trajectory of the travel and cost, as such, should remain confidential and not open to abuse or manipulation from third parties. In addition, the payment should occur in a peer-to-peer manner between the client and the car.\nThus, a hardware device is needed to connect to the vehicle to ensure the secure management of customer and car data using the Blockchain. This further assures a secure peer-to-peer payment between the customer and the car.\nWe will implement the Ridesharing/Ride-hailing use case in our proposal submitted in fund 9: PeakChain Uber on Cardano\nOriginal article published in PeakChain Medium Publication under this link\nCheck our educational content under this link\nTo Support our educational content and contribute in the Success of PeakChain Automotive Solutions, we appreciate delegating to our PeakChain Pool, Ticker: [PKCP]\nSupport also our PeakChain Automotive Solutions in Project Catalyst Fund 9!\n1- PeakChain Car Wallet Device\n2- PeakChain Uber on Cardano\n3- PeakChain Fleet Management Platform\n4- PeakChain Car-Sharing Platform\nAuthor: Oussama Benmahmoud, CEO of PeakSoft GmbH and Founder of PeakChain\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "PeakChain Fleet Management Platform on Cardano Blockchain?",

Two key examples include protecting vehicle security and optimizing fuel usage during trips.\nAs a result, a fleet management platform represents a critical component, allowing greater oversight for such businesses.\nThese days, all fleet management solutions are built on centralized servers, which are responsible for managing, storing and protecting all vehicle and trip data. This is a critical issue for businesses: any sensitive data stored on a centralized server can be hacked or compromised, resulting in devastatingly catastrophic consequences for impacted companies.\nThe perfect solution to protect fleet data? Manage the data using a genuinely decentralized blockchain solution.\nPeakChain is building a fleet management solution on Cardano, comprising four components:\n1- Hardware Component: CAN Bus raw data are retrieved directly from the car, before being transferred to PeakChain Server using a dedicated SIM\n2- Data decoding and processing component: A suitable database will be used to decode raw data. Next, the decoded data is processed to calculate the data which will be transmitted to the blockchain\n3- Vehicle Wallet component: Upon decoding and processing raw data, a transaction is built and submitted to the Cardano blockchain, which includes the vehicle and trip data.\n4- Web App component: Functionalities including vehicle registration and checking the trip will be accessible for the fleet manager.

So, there is a data issue present: customer data may be compromised by malicious third parties.\nIn 2022, people are more aware than at any other point in history about protecting their data and privacy. But, this worry can be alleviated, at least through carsharing solutions built on a real decentralized blockchain solution.\nPeakChain is building a carsharing solution on Cardano, comprising of five unique components:\n1- Hardware Component: CAN Bus raw data are retrieved directly from the car and transferred to PeakChain s Server through a dedicated SIM.\n2- Data decoding and processing component: A suitable database will be used to decode raw data. The decoded data is later processed to calculate the data transmitted to the blockchain.\n3- Vehicle Wallet component: Upon decoding and processing raw data, a transaction is built and submitted to the Cardano blockchain, which includes the vehicle and trip data.\n4- Carsharing Smart Contract: The smart contract lives in the blockchain, visible to any customer. In this way, it is a peer-to-peer contract between the vehicle and the customer. Service costs will be automatically calculated once the trip ends. Next, the fees are transferred from the Customer Wallet to the Car Wallet without any third-party interaction.\n5- Web App component: Web App functionalities include vehicle and customer registration, trip start and end data, and trip history and costs information.

I dived into the journey of exploring the technology and understanding the opportunities and challenges of building on Cardano.\nI begun by learning the basics of functional programming in general, as well as, in particular, the fundamentals of Haskell. I started my journey with Haskell Mongolia Course, published by IOG and led by Dr. Lars Br njes, the chief of IOG Learning, and Dr. Andres L h from Well-Typed LLP. It was an excellent course where I gained knowledge of the basic concepts of functional programming and Haskell, while using the same knowledge for Plutus.\nAdditionally, I have also purchased a Haskell book, Learn You a Haskell for a Great Good , which Charles Hoskinson always recommended.\nDue to enjoying podcasts, I began to search for useful ones regarding functional programming. Jonathan Fishbein, a Cardano community member and Plutus developer, recently kickstarted an interesting podcast called Plutus cast . In this podcast, Jonathan spoke about Plutus architecture and his experience as a developer in the Cardano ecosystem.\nHe also recommended an excellent functional programming podcast called lambda cast .

    "prompt": "Financial aspects?",
    "completion": "Ada (from 19th-century English writer and mathematician Ada Lovelace) is Cardano's native digital currency. It is the sole means to pay for transactions on the Cardano blockchain. Formal ledger rules determine the effects of these ledger transactions, yielding an immutable and independently verifiable record that tracks the movement of ada and other assets over time. Transactions are authorized using secure cryptographic keys that are owned by the ada holder.\nAs described below, ada holders can opt to stake their ada holding in order to participate in the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which determines how transactions are included in successive Cardano blocks. They receive rewards for this in proportion to the stake that has been delegated. In addition, ada allows holders to:\nparticipate in governance activities, including voting on Catalyst ecosystem proposals\npay for the costs of creating and transferring assets such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\npay for the costs of using smart contracts\npay for the costs of recording data on the blockchain\ntransfer ada tokens to other users\n1 ada is divided into 1,000,000 lovelace.\nAs a fully decentralized blockchain, a large network of Cardano stake pools creates 100 of the blocks. These pools gather the ada that has been delegated ('staked') by ada holders, earning rewards that are based on the blocks that the pool contributes to the chain.\nEvery 5 days (a Cardano epoch), Ouroboros chooses certain pools to add blocks to the chain, in proportion to the ada that is held by each pool. At the end of the epoch, block creation rewards are given to the pools that have been selected and that have successfully created their assigned blocks. These rewards are distributed among those ada holders who staked their ada as well as the pool operator, and contribute to the pool's maintenance, growth, and sustainability.\nSince the chance of a stake pool being selected for block creation increases based upon the amount of ada delegated to it, it's important for the pool to attract as many delegators as possible, up to the point when the pool becomes 'saturated'. When the pool is saturated, it has reached the peak return-on-investment (ROI) for its delegators. Any more ada delegated to a saturated pool will dilute the rewards for other delegators, reducing the ROI. The saturation property is designed to avoid a single pool dominating block creation, encouraging staked ada to be distributed among many stake, non-saturated pools.\nCheck out this staking tutorial for more information.\nIdentity stands at the center of everything a blockchain can do. Blockchain identity solutions enable participants to build bonds and access essential services.\nCardano integrates decentralized identity to open up a brand new range of opportunities and inclusivity that confluence in RealFi Real finance targeted at the people who really need new ways to access finance, creating that real value often missing from DeFi.\nRealFi is an ecosystem of products that remove the frictions between real world economic activities to offer greater access and cheaper credit/financial products for real people.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Technology?",
    "completion": "The Cardano architecture features three layers:\nConsensus layer\nLedger layer\nNetwork layer\nConsensus layer\nThis layer performs two fundamental functions:\nRunning the Ouroboros consensus protocol. This layer takes decisions like adopting blocks, choosing between competing chains (if there are any), and decides when to produce blocks of its own; and\nMaintaining all the state that is required to make the decisions taken in the consensus layer.\nLedger layer\nThis layer specifies:\nWhat the state of the ledger looks like; and\nHow the ledger must be updated for each new block.\nThe ledger layer consists exclusively of pure functions that specify the transitions between successive ledger states, as derived from the formal ledger rules, using the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) accounting model. The state transitions are driven by the set of transactions contained within the Cardano blocks, and by major events such as epoch boundary transitions and hard fork combinator events.\nThe consensus layer does not need to know the exact nature of the ledger state, nor the contents of the blocks, apart from some header fields required to run the consensus protocol.\nNetwork layer\nThis layer maintains the connections between all the distributed nodes in the Cardano network, obtains new blocks from the network as they are produced by block producing nodes, builds newly minted transactions into blocks, and transmits blocks between nodes.\nCardano uses strong cryptographic primitives to securely create and send transactions, and to protect the security and integrity of the protocol.\nCardano utilizes asymmetric key pairs for:\nSigning and validating payments and staking certificates;\nSmart contract execution\nMulti-signature transactions\nIdentifying and defining addresses on the Cardano blockchain\nKey pairs include a public and a private key. By using their private key, users provide cryptographic proof that they indeed own the coins or assets they're using.\nCryptography also provides security for the consensus protocol. The two main mechanisms are:\nNode keys, which are used to register and operate stake pools, and are sub-divided into Operator/operational key, Key Evolving Signature (KES) key pairs, and Verifiable Random Function (VRF) keys; and\nPayment and stake credentials, which are used to authorize fund transfers or to delegate stake to stake pools. These may be either key hashes or script hashes.\nLearn more about Cardano's cryptography.\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) communication enables nodes to self-organize into a globally distributed network of Cardano block producers and relays, and also self-optimize, choosing the best and more performant connected nodes and disconnecting from less performant ones.\nInformation is exchanged between nodes to enable a flexible network topology that automatically adapts to dynamically changing network conditions. This further boosts network decentralization, resilience and robustness.\nThe network's P2P architecture includes four elements:\nP2P Governor\nConnection Manager\nServer\nInbound Protocol Governor\nRead more about P2P communication in Cardano.\nRead more about Cardano s decentralization drive.\nCardano's proof-of-stake consensus protocol.\nIn mythology, Ouroboros (also, uroboros) is usually depicted as a snake (or sometimes a dragon) eating its own tail in a closed circle. The word Ouroboros itself derives from Ancient Greek, its literal meaning being 'tail eating' or 'tail devourer.'\nAs a symbol, Ouroboros represents the infinity of time flowing back unto itself, in a never-ending cycle, as if caught in an eternal loop. Ouroboros first appeared in Egypt, in the 13th century BC. Later, alchemists adopted Ouroboros into their mystical symbolism.\nSo why was this mythical creature chosen to represent the proof-of-stake consensus protocol that underlies Cardano? In this context, Ouroboros represents the possibility of infinite and ethical growth and scalability of the blockchain, and also, the protocol feeds itself from previous epochs for the randomness used in the current epoch. This is known as eating its own tail , as the pictorial representation of Ouroboros does.\nOuroboros' central message is the delivery of greater opportunities for the world, and its preservation through much-reduced energy consumption.\nOuroboros is the first provably secure proof-of-stake blockchain protocol. In other words, Ouroboros offers mathematically verifiable security against attackers. The protocol is guaranteed to be secure, as long as 51 of the stake is held by honest participants.\nOuroboros realizes what is known as Nakamoto-style consensus based on proof-of-stake. This provides the robustness from Bitcoin but ensures significant energy efficiency, higher speed and a fair reward mechanism. Also, the protocol ensures security against network attacks and has a rigorous game-theoretic mechanism designed to discourage monopolization.\nOuroboros upgrades are smooth due to hard-fork combinator technology, which does not cause disruptions for users. There have been several flavors of Ouroboros, released in stages.\nThis is just a high-level overview of Cardano s protocol. For more information about Ouroboros, visit IOG s research library page.\nCardano uses an innovative Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) accounting model to support multi-assets and smart contracts.\nSmart contracts are digital agreements, written in code, that can be executed without an intermediary once certain conditions are met. Smart contracts make non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance applications possible.\nBuilding on Bitcoin s UTXO model, the EUTXO model provides a secure and versatile environment to process multiple operations without system failures. This model offers better scalability and privacy, as well as more simplified transaction logic, as each UTXO can only be consumed once and as a whole, which makes transaction verification much simpler.\nEUTXO offers unique advantages over other accounting models. The success or failure of transaction validation depends only on the transaction itself and its inputs, and not on anything else on the blockchain. As a consequence, the validity of a transaction can be checked off-chain, before the transaction is sent to the blockchain. A transaction can still fail if some other transaction concurrently consumes an input that the transaction is expecting, but if all inputs are still present, the transaction is guaranteed to succeed.\nInteroperability is about two or more blockchains interacting to move assets and data back and forth. This is usually achieved by two-way mechanisms called bridges.\nInteroperating chains can be in a symmetric or an asymmetric relationship. Two main chains that interoperate (Ethereum and Cardano, for instance) form the symmetric case. A mainchain and a sidechain that interoperate form the asymmetric case.\nIn the symmetric case, if one chain dies, the other one is not affected. The situation is different with the asymmetric case, because the sidechain depends on the mainchain, but not the other way around. If the sidechain dies or is compromised, a firewall property typically protects the mainchain from harm. However, if the mainchain is compromised, the sidechain will usually no longer be able to function securely. However, the precise consequences depend on the nature of the sidechain's dependency on the mainchain.\nThe main blockchain and its properties (like throughput and scaling) represent layer 1. Sidechains and off-chain solutions (like ZK-rollups) that run independently alongside the main blockchain are referred to as layer 2 solutions.\nSidechains\nSidechains give two immediate advantages to a network:\nEasy addition of new features; and\nScalability\nNew features\nThe addition of sidechains enables blockchain developers to add new features to a network without introducing additional security risks. These added features open up the possibility for developers building on top of the network to explore new use cases.\nAlso, sidechains can inherit some (or all) features (ledger model, consensus mechanism, etc.) from their parent chain, and pair them with features that might not exist on the main chain. For example, a sidechain can combine different security models, consensus protocols, or governance models to create a brand new blockchain that can interoperate with other blockchain networks.\nThe EVM sidechain is a Cardano sidechain -which is currently underway- this sidechain will enable Solidity DApps and EVM developers to build on the Cardano platform. In this way, developers can easily expand their community's reach into Cardano and benefit from the blockchain's existing capabilities.\nScalability\nSidechains enable a high degree of versatility and scalability. A blockchain can spin up a series of sidechains and 'delegate' processing work to them to increase throughput, for example. Think of this as a manager delegating tasks to other staff so that more work can be done simultaneously.\nSidechains do have one drawback: in most cases, they're not operated by the same nodes or network as the mainchain, which means that sidechain nodes will need to trust the sidechain's security model. The EVM sidechain however will implement a sidechain that will inherit Cardano s security model.\nHydra is a layer 2 solution for Cardano. It is not a single protocol, but rather a family of layer 2 protocols designed to address network security and scalability capabilities. As part of the Basho development phase, Hydra focuses on steady network optimizations and improvements to establish a scalable, versatile, and high-throughput blockchain. The Hydra suite of protocols includes the Hydra Head protocol, Interhead Hydra, Hydra Tail, etc.\nThe Hydra Head protocol is the first in this suite and an important element of Cardano s scaling journey. It provides the foundation on which to build out advanced scalability solutions and will be the first element to be delivered while research on the others is completed.\nHydra Heads are isomorphic multi-party state channels and form fast and secure off-chain communication paths between two or more participants to process transactions. Being isomorphic means that this channel works just the same way as the mainchain, but is faster and cheaper to operate due to its local scope. It is very similar to Bitcoin Lightning, but elegantly extends the mainchain with fully capable EUTXO mini-ledgers to layer more complex solutions on top. Use cases of the basic Hydra Head include bank-to-bank private transfers for processing multiple transactions between 2 or more peers, a pay-per-use API service to pay a virtual private cloud provider for resources, an auction between a seller and several bidders, etc.\nThis technology can also produce advanced layer 2 solutions, including networks of Hydra Heads that would support fast and cheap consumer-to-consumer payments, or Interhead Hydra, which could introduce seamless smart contract scalability.\nMithril\nMithril is a research and engineering effort carried out by IOG to boost the efficiency and speed of data synchronization, state bootstrapping, and trust issues in blockchain applications. As part of the Basho development phase, Mithril is now in development to be applied as a protocol on Cardano.\nData synchronization and state bootstrapping are integral to ensuring the accuracy of operations on the blockchain. For certain messages or actions, it is important that a particular number of stakeholders provide their cryptographic signatures.\nFor the base case, we go from a linear number of participants (without Mithril) to a logarithmic one (with Mithril), which is more efficient. This means that the higher the number of participants who need to agree on operations, the more complex it becomes to efficiently aggregate their signatures. In a base scenario, to presume a signature that talks for the majority of stakeholders, every stakeholder needs to sign the appropriate individual message. This results in delays in terms of scalability and speed.\nMithril has been designed to address these issues and to ensure efficient data and state synchronization while preserving rigorous security settings. Simply put, Mithril allows a variety of applications to work faster on the blockchain. Mithril's aggregation does not require signers to coordinate with other signers to produce signatures: they can sign independently and anyone can perform the aggregation, even at a later time. The signature scheme also lets different stakeholders validate only a given checkpoint of the chain (where 'checkpoint' is a state of the chain at some point in time, plus Mithril proofs to support that) without going through the whole transaction history of the given state. This results in fast chain state bootstrapping,\nOverall, the protocol is also beneficial for light client applications like light wallets that need to work fast without a full chain synchronization. Mithril signatures can be also useful for lightweight tally verification, or cryptocurrency governance decision making. When applied to full node clients like Daedalus, Mithril can boost full node data synchronization ensuring speed and decreasing resource consumption.\nSince the Alonzo hard fork in September 2021, Cardano offers a blockchain environment to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The DApp Store currently under development will be a gateway to the Cardano DApp ecosystem.\nFor developers, the DApp Store will provide a path to building product awareness and driving user adoption, plus a way to establish their DApps' legitimacy and build reputation.\nFor end users, the dAppStore will be an on-ramp, the main touch point to a wide range of blockchain products, and a path to the discovery of new use cases and capabilities offered by DApps. The DApp Store will provide frictionless access to the ecosystem through an easy to use interface. End users will be equipped with all the information about DApp offerings, including the security assurance level of certified DApps, and usage statistics to help them make the right choices.\nHard forks tend to be 'traumatic' events where a blockchain splits ('forks'), rendering the 'old' blockchain invalid, along with its transaction history, protocol, etc.\nThe hard fork combinator is an IOG engineered, open-source technology that, rather than discarding the old data, combines two protocols into a single protocol. We call this a sequential combination of the two protocols because it runs the first protocol for a while and at some point, it switches over to the second. The current Cardano chain combines blocks of the following development phases: Byron, Shelley, Allegra, Mary, and Alonzo. After future transitions, it will also combine Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire blocks - all as a single property.\nWe have successfully used this technology for all the hard forks that Cardano has undergone (except for the first one, where Cardano switched from Ouroboros Classic to Ouroboros BFT.)\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

Decentralization dissolves the concentration of power by enabling peers to make choices and decisions, and returning ownership of personal information where it belongs- with the users.\nOn March 31, 2021, Cardano's block production became fully decentralized. On that day, the stake pool operator (SPO) community began producing 100 of new blocks. This was an important milestone on the way to Cardano's ultimate destination; the creation of a platform wholly and democratically operated and controlled through a global community of SPOs, developers, and ada holders.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "completion": "The project to create Cardano was initiated by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, and entrepreneurs concentrated in Asia at the end of 2014. Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood founded Input Output (initially, IOHK) to design and implement Cardano. In addition, the Cardano Foundation was set up to oversee and supervise the development of Cardano and to act as an advocate for its users. The foundation is based in Switzerland. A third entity, Emurgo, was created to pursue commercial activities on behalf of the ecosystem and community. The three entities have separate ownerships and leadership.\nThe Cardano blockchain and ada, its founding native cryptocurrency, was launched in 2017 and established itself as one of the leading blockchains.\nIOHK has evolved into Input Output Global, Inc. (IOG) with Charles Hoskinson as Chief Executive Officer. IOG is incorporated in the state of Wyoming, USA.\nAs the blockchain engineering and research company that is participating, along with the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and other third parties, in developing the core Cardano platform, IOG has assembled a multi-talented global team of more than 600 people. This includes computer scientists, academic researchers, software engineers, product specialists, and technical architects.\nWith over 600 staff (as of May 2022), IOG is an ever-expanding constellation for the development of decentralized applications, identity solutions, wallets, and an eclectic and thematically diversified range of decentralized applications for blockchain.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "What Vasil upgrade brings to Cardano?",
    "completion": "The IOG team doesn t care if it s a bear or bull market and is constantly improving the Cardano protocol. What matters is the long-term vision. This way the team delivers what the community expects. Let s take a look at what the long-awaited Vasil upgrade brings to Cardano.\nNo digital technology can do without a team that fixes bugs and brings major improvements from time to time. Blockchain is a technology and it needs to be improved, as only increasing efficiency, new capabilities, and reducing costs for users will bring long-term success in the form of wider adoption. This is true for both the current IT giants and for blockchain technology, which came into the world more than 10 years ago as very inefficient. If a blockchain network is one day to be used by hundreds of millions of users per day, continued innovation is essential.\nCardano is designed to be able to innovate regularly without interruption. Cardano is a global network, so it is not possible to temporarily shut it down to update the network. The team has found a way to make updates while not impacting the use of the network. They created a hard-fork combinator tool to do this. The hard-fork combinator allows updates to be deployed without restricting usage. Users won t even notice that the improvements have been deployed. However, they can start using them immediately.\nThe Vasil upgrade brings significant performance and capability enhancements to the Cardano protocol. The upgrade is included in Cardano node version 1.35.0. The most important improvement in the Vasil upgrade is mainly Diffusion pipelining, which will affect better scalability. There are also several CIPs (Cardano Improvement Proposal) that are related to the Plutus platform.\nDiffusion pipelining streamlines the propagation of information about newly produced blocks among participants in a Peer-to-Peer network. This enhancement allows the distribution of block information before the block is fully validated on a node. This makes it possible to parallelize block validation and distribution.\nThe throughput of the network can be made more efficient by increasing the block size and decreasing the interval at which new blocks are created. More information, for example, transactions, can be inserted into a larger block. The more frequently blocks are created, the more user requests will be processed in a given time.\nIncreasing block size and decreasing block size has limitations due to the capabilities of the Internet. Cardano is a global network with nodes all over the world. If a node creates a new block in, for example, Europe, the block must gradually make its way through other nodes to Asia, South and North America, Australia, and other places. Each individual node validates the information before it can distribute it further to its peers. This means that some time called Delay elapses before the block reaches at least 95 of the nodes in the network. This time is at most 5 seconds in a Cardano network. Delay set to 5 seconds is the time needed to guarantee the propagation of a block whose size does not exceed 2 MB.\nObviously, the bigger the block, the longer it will take to validate it (CPU time) and therefore the longer it will take to distribute it. In the Cardano network, it is necessary to validate not only transactions but also Plutus scripts. Validating scripts is more computationally intensive than validating transactions. As the block size grows, the number of scripts in it may grow, so the time to validate the whole block will also grow.\nNote that the block time must be set to a longer time than the Delay to allow sufficient margin to propagate the block through the network. In the case of Cardano, the block time is now set to 20 seconds. If the time to distribute the block can be reduced, the block time can be gradually reduced as well. This will result in higher throughput.\nHow is the validation of blocks actually done? For simplicity, you can think of each node as having three layers. At the very bottom is the network layer, which receives and sends data over the Internet. The network layer can receive and send blocks. A block can be processed in parts, i.e. as a block header and block body. The second layer is the consensus layer. At this level, validation of the block header and body takes place. Validating the block body is more computationally intensive than validating the header. The third layer is the blockchain, which receives valid blocks. You can think of it as information moving from the bottom layer to the top. Only valid blocks get into the blockchain. Invalid blocks will be discarded by consensus, so they will not be stored in the blockchain or distributed further into the network.\nLet s now take a simplified look at how a block is distributed in a Peer-to-Peer network. Imagine that a block producer has just created a new block. We ll look at what the block validator has to do. The block producer sends the block header to the block validator. The block validator must verify that the header complies with the protocol rules. For example, it must verify that the block producer was indeed the chosen slot leader (proof must be provided), that the digital signature is correct, and that the new block correctly references the previous block. If the block header is in order, the block body is also downloaded. The block header contains a reference to the block body. The block validator verifies that the reference is correct and if so, can validate transactions and execute Plutus scripts. If the block body is correct, the block validator can add the block to its version of the blockchain and further distribute the block to the network to the next peer (next block validator).\nNote that each block validator must validate both the block header and the block body before the block can be redistributed. The total time required to distribute a block to the entire network would be obtained by multiplying the average validation time on one block validator by the number of hops in the network.\nDiffusion pipelining will speed up the distribution of blocks in the network by having the block validator send the block body to the network before validating the contained data. The block validator only validates the reference between the header and body and if it is OK, it immediately propagates the block. The validator must verify that it has received the block that belongs to the received header. Validating a reference (header s body hash) takes only a short time compared to validating the rest of the body. This means that the total budget for distributing the block to the entire network is reduced by the time that individual hops would have spent validating the block body. In other words, the validation of the block body and the block distribution are done concurrently. Diffusion pipelining increases the speed of data availability.\nNote that only the block producer (slot leader) validates the block body at the beginning of distribution to the network. All other nodes distribute the entire block after validating only the block header and the reference in the block body.\nIncomplete blocks are not distributed in the network because if the block validator does not receive a block body with a correct reference, it discards the entire block. If the reference in the block body is correct but the subsequent validation of the body fails, the entire block is discarded by honest nodes.\nNote that a change at the network level has no significant effect on consensus. All the necessary validation to accept a block and add it to the blockchain is done in the same way as before the upgrade. Diffusion pipelining increases the speed of block propagation in the network, opening up opportunities for increasing block size and potentially reducing block time.\nLet s calculate how much faster the block is propagated from the block producer through the 4 block validator if the header validation takes 50 ms and the body validation takes 250 ms. We will count the block production in the total time since the producer has to validate the body. Without Diffusion Pipelining, the validation of the whole block takes 300 ms at each node. So the propagation time from the block producer to the fourth block validator takes 5 * 300 ms, which is 1500 ms (1.5 s).\nWith Diffusion Pipelining, validating a block takes only the time needed to validate the header (50 ms) and verify the reference between the header and the body of the block, counting 5 ms. Only 55 ms is required for the block to be sufficiently validated and distributed to the peer. The total block distribution time will take 300 + (4 * 55), which is 520 ms.\nThe following table shows the improvements that can be achieved through the upgrade. The last line shows the data for Asynchronous Validation (AV). AV is not part of the Vasil upgrade and is another possible enhancement that extends Diffusion pipelining.\nCIPs related to the Plutus platform\nLet s start with CIP-32, which refers to Inline Datums. Extended UTXO allows users to optionally add arbitrary user data in JSON-like format to UTXO. This data is called Datum. The Datum will allow developers to give scripts state-like functionality. User data can be considered as a local script state. This state has only local validity as it is associated with a specific UTXO.\nCurrently, Datum is implemented by attaching hashes of datums to outputs, and requiring that the spending transaction provides the actual Datum. The data from the spending transaction is verified by making a hash that must match the hash that is stored in Datum.\nThe advantage is the space-saving in the blockchain since the Datum is just a hash to the data, which can be arbitrarily large. The disadvantage is that the data, whose hash is the same as the hash in Datum, must be provided in the transaction. Let s add that, in theory, the data can be, for example, just a short number that can be smaller than the hash. In this case, it would be more convenient to have the data directly in Datum rather than a hash.\nA Datum contains data that represents some application logic. The data in Datum is inserted by the party that creates the output by the Plutus transaction. The spending party must understand this application logic, i.e. it must understand the contents of the Datum, and this is not possible without communication with the party that created the output. The communication must take place either off-chain or by another way on-chain. This might be inconvenient for the spending party.\nCIP-32 proposes that the Datum could either contain the data directly (inline data) or a hash of the data, as it is now. Plutus transactions allow you to choose one of the approaches.\nIf the data were directly in the Datum, there would be no need to insert the data into spending transactions. Remember that the user can still use Redeemer as input for the Plutus script.\nThis new approach to Datum will make dApp developers jobs easier, especially when combined with CIP-31.\nCIP-31 proposes to create a new kind of input, a reference input, that would allow you to look at the output without having to spend it. This will allow access to the information that is stored in the blockchain in the form of Datums without having to spend and recreate the UTXOs that are associated with Datums. In addition, it will be possible to check the value related to reference input.\nThe Datum essentially provides a way to store data on the blockchain and access it. You can look at it as a source of information. Unfortunately, access to data in Datum is currently limited in many ways. In order to access and use the information, you must spend an output that is associated with the Datum.\nThe application may need to use the information and if it wants to keep it for future use, it must create a new output with the same information. The disadvantage is that new output is created, so if someone else wants to access the information, they cannot use the old output, but the newly created one. However, the new output is created after the new block is added. In practice, this means that some applications are limited to one operation per block.\nMoreover, if a party wants to look at the information in Datum and is forced to spend an output, then it means that the spend conditions must be met and the party must consider what to do with the funds. This is inconvenient and most importantly expensive.\nCIP-31 is going to change it. The author of a transaction specifies inputs as either spending inputs or reference inputs. A reference input is a transaction input, which is linked to a particular transaction output as normal, except that it references the output rather than spending it.\nIn other words, you now have to pay the transaction fee to get information from Datum since it is necessary to spend the output. After the Vasil upgrade, you can get the information almost for free in the context of spending transaction that is going to spend other UTXOs. Note that even if a transaction contains an input reference, it must still spend at least one output. So the transaction fee must always be paid.\nReference output is not taken into account when balancing a transaction, i.e. when checking if the value on the input is the same as the value on the output of the transaction. This means that spending conditions for reference output are not checked at all. The reference output remains in the active UTXO set for future use. Importantly, reference inputs are visible to scripts, so the data from the Datum of these reference inputs can be used as input for the script s decision logic.\nThe script receives information about transactions through the script context. Newly, it receives additional information that a list of reference inputs can be included. This way the script will know how to work with reference inputs correctly.\nThe transaction has as input a UTXO that is planned to be spent and at the same time can also have a reference input. Reference input can be used during the execution of the Plutus script. After validation and inclusion of the transaction in the block, the UTXO is spent, but the reference input remains unchanged and can be accessed by another party afterward. The information in Datum is thus available for a longer period of time for multiple users.\nFor example, applications can check the state (Datum, or locked value) without having to consume the output. On-chain data providers can store arbitrary data in Datum and other scripts (applications) can access that data. There is only one payment for storing the data on the blockchain, and then it will be available to others.\nCIP-33 uses CIP-31 and CIP-32 to allow attaching scripts to outputs. CIP-33 introduces reference scripts that can be used to satisfy script requirements during validation.\nEach time a script is to be used, the transaction that requires its use must provide the whole script as part of the transaction. This bloats the chain and increases the user fee. If a transaction uses multiple scripts, it may run into a problem with the maximum size limitation.\nReference input and inline Datum solve the problem by allowing the script to be stored in the blockchain. Then it can be referenced repeatedly. A spending transaction that wants to spend UTXO can reference the script to be used for validation. This means that the transaction that uses the script does not have to carry the script s contents. It just needs to reference the output in which the script is located.\nWhen a transaction is validated and it is necessary to provide the script corresponding to a script hash, in addition to the scripts provided in the transaction itself, it will be also considered any reference scripts from the outputs referred to by the inputs of the transaction. In other words, the reference to the script (that has been already stored in the blockchain) will be used.\nWith this enhancement, applications don t have to frequently send scripts every time they want to use it. The script will be stored on-chain and reusable for multiple UTXOs. The same script can be used by multiple parties.\nWe have described the main improvements that the Vasil upgrade will bring. In fact, the upgrade will include several other minor improvements. Increasing the scalability and improving the Plutus platform opens up new possibilities for developers and benefits for users.\nWe'll be anxious to see how the TPS changes after activation on cexplorer.io.\nThe upgrade was named in honor of the late Vasil St. Dabov, a Cardano ambassador and a big supporter of the project who sadly passed away in 2021.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Why the EUTXO model is ideal for layer 2 zkrollups like Orbis?",
    "completion": "The Cardano blockchain is constantly evolving to serve a thriving community of users that leverage it for various financial services and transactions. This year, the blockchain s main focus is to develop and implement scaling solutions methodically.\nLayer 2 solutions create additional improvements to the layer 1 protocol, helping a blockchain scale and providing efficient and seamless transaction experiences to its users.\nThat s where layer 2 scaling solutions come in. The Orbis protocol, which I previously discussed in April s 360, is one such example.\nDuring the show, I gave a detailed explanation of what Orbis would do for Cardano. In this post, you can learn more about Orbis, how it will help the blockchain scale, and why Cardano s EUTXO model lends itself more to building effective layer 2 solutions compared to other accounting models.\nTo understand why the EUTXO model works well for scaling solutions, let s first look at what these solutions are.\nSimply put, the Orbis protocol will be Cardano s first layer 2 zero-knowledge (zk) proof solution that is infinitely scalable. With zk-rollups such as Orbis, a ZK proof enables batching thousands of transactions into a single proof and verification of their validity through a single transaction on the Cardano blockchain.\nOrbis is a general-purpose zk-rollup compatible with any DApp that runs on Cardano. The layer 2 solution aims to support DeFi applications by offering enhanced transaction throughput and scalability required for Cardano to truly become a global financial system.\nScaling is possible through the following steps:\nMultiple transactions take place off-chain on layer 2.\nThey are then bundled into one zero-knowledge proof (zk-rollup).\nAnd finally, the zk proof is submitted on-chain to Cardano s layer 1 for verification.\nFigure 1. The relationship between Orbis and Cardano\nThese zk-rollups guarantee, with complete mathematical certainty, that each of the multiple transactions has occurred on the Orbis protocol. And they do so without revealing all the details of said transactions.\nOrbis will essentially consist of two main parts:\nAn off-chain Prover node that processes and proves that transactions are taking place, allowing its users to interact with Orbis and post transactions.\nAn on-chain Verifier contract that settles transactions happening on-rollup onto the layer 1, accepting asset inputs to be used on the rollup and verifying the Prover s transactions.\nThe ability to effectively compress transactions together on the layer 2 ensures a much higher throughput at a faster speed and lower fees.\nZK-Rollups usually operate on an account-based model like Ethereum s, however, according to Ryan, Cardano s EUTXO model is better suited for zk-rollups.\nHere s how.\nThe main difference between the EUTXO and account-based models that gives Cardano the edge comes down to how the two handle state.\nWhereas Ethereum s model considers a whole set of data through a global state, Cardano s model considers a local state, only analyzing a relevant transaction s UTxOs. This makes it easier to parallelize transactions and bundle them together into a single proof that can then be submitted on-chain.\nFigure 2. Cardano s EUTXO model v Ethereum s Account-based model\nParallelism, one of Cardano s key features, is basically a system s ability to create multiple transactions at the same time without any interference.\nOn Cardano, parallelism goes hand in hand with concurrency, another key advantage of the EUTXO model. As parallelism aligns the transactions, concurrency processes them simultaneously. Thus, the maximum achievable parallelism increases as the level of concurrency increases. Through this process, performance and throughput improve.\nParallelism and concurrency, therefore, allow Orbis to leverage the EUTXO model and scale throughput infinitely in the long run, while reducing the amount of computational data required to process transactions.\nAs you can see with Orbis zk-rollups approach, Cardano s architecture is aptly constructed to eventually become the blockchain that provides financial services to the entire globe.\nHowever, Orbis isn t the only way that Cardano is scaling in 2022 and beyond.

    "prompt": "Cardano data on BigQuery?",
    "completion": "Summary:\nBigQuery allows querying Cardano data quickly, seamlessly, and at a low cost\nArticle:\nThe Cardano blockchain is fast becoming a hive of development for decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. With almost one hundred projects already live, and over one thousand projects busy building, Cardano s database of transactions keeps growing.\nData querying is essential for live projects or developers working on the blockchain. Why? Because data accuracy is the foundation for secure and trustless activities. Think about wallets. To process a transaction, the system needs to know how much funds you have and whether it is enough to cover the intended transaction. The record of this transaction is then added to the chain, which requires the wallet to be fully synced with the latest blockchain state.\nIf you are building on Cardano, you will likely need to query blockchain data. And in this post, we discuss some options including a way to query Cardano data using Google BigQuery.\nThousands of decentralized nodes maintain the Cardano network, each holding a full copy of the blockchain. Because the blockchain size constantly increases with the number of new transactions and data added to the chain, the time to sync the whole blockchain history increases accordingly.\nCardano DB Sync is one of the core Cardano components, which provides a convenient way to find and query historical information from the Cardano blockchain. DB Sync connects to the local node as a client and synchronizes with the on-chain activity. Using DB Sync, however, requires deeper technical knowledge to run a node and a local database server.\nAddressing the need to provide a simpler data querying alternative, several solutions appeared. Depending on technical expertise, software requirements, and needs, users can choose from a number of community-driven solutions that aim to streamline data querying. Cardano Blockchain Insights, for example, provide blockchain data in visual charts and dashboards using Google Data Studio. Scrolls and Blockfrost are among other solutions that aim to optimize working with the blockchain data.\nIOG is introducing a Google BigQuery option for working with Cardano data. Google BigQuery makes it easier to look up data without the need to run specialized software. All the data is fetched directly from Cardano DB Sync and validated to ensure its accuracy. This means that due to a sophisticated data validation process, users can be assured of having access to the same data as in DB Sync. BigQuery organizes Cardano data by epoch numbers, which allows per-epoch queries, resulting in lower costs. By additionally using Google Data Studio, you can create advanced visualizations and dashboards based on the BigQuery data.\nEnsure you're logged into your Google Cloud Platform account and have the BigQuery API enabled. Then, getting started is straightforward:\nopen or create a Google BigQuery or a Data Studio project\naccess the IOG analytics dataset\nYou can now query the Cardano blockchain data.\nUsing the dataset is pretty simple. You can select any table you re interested in and click Query to get the details:\nFigure 1. IOG data analytics dashboard\nYou can also import the queried data into Google Data Studio. This will allow you to create various charts and graphs to visualize transaction or block statistics. See some Cardano Blockchain Insights examples here.\nThere are several things you should note when working with BigQuery:\nThe data is fetched and copied over from DB Sync every two hours.\nThe data is only updated to approximately the last 20 blocks before the current block height in DB Sync. This is essential to prevent rollbacks of blocks in the case of chain forks.\nUsually, the cost for querying data on BigQuery is $5 per terabyte (TB) of data processed. There is also a free quota of one TB of data per month. To find out more, see the BigQuery pricing details. It is important to note though that Cardano data tables are divided by epoch numbers, which makes it possible to query data for the exact epoch of choice, which reduces the amount of data processed and thus incurs lower costs.\nCurrently, the Cardano BigQuery project is in its beta release. It does not include all the blockchain data, particularly staking and staking rewards details. The team at IOG is now working on its further development, and in future iterations, the IOG analytics dataset will cover all the Cardano data from DB Sync.\nTo start working with a tool, make sure to read the documentation with a step-by-step tutorial. You will also find different table schemas with example queries.\nWe welcome your feedback, which you can share by emailing data-analytics@iohk.io.\nI d like to thank Alexander Diemand and Thomas Kaliakos for their input and support in preparing this blog post.\nLegal Disclaimer\nIn this piece there are links that will bring you to a third-party website, owned and operated by an independent party over which Input Output Global, Inc. has no control (\"3rd Party Website\").

    "prompt": "Cardano staking and how does it work?",
    "completion": "Staking is the process of allowing people to participate in the decentralisation and security of the Cardano network. People can earn rewards for participating. In a decentralized network, decision-making power must be distributed among the participants. ADA coins are used to do this. Everyone who owns an ADA coin holds a stake, i.e. a certain share of decision-making power. These people are called stakeholders.\nADA coins can be used to actively participate in the network consensus. New blocks must be created in the network at regular intervals. Entities called cardano stake pools are responsible for producing blocks. A pool is a network node that is operated by a pool operator. Anyone with the necessary technical knowledge, equipment and a certain number of ADA coins can operate their own pool.\nStakeholders can take advantage of ADA coins and engage in stake delegation. It is necessary to have coins in your own wallet, which will allow you to choose one of the many pools to which coins can be delegated. By delegating coins, the selected pool gains a stronger position in the network and gets the opportunity to create more blocks. The strength of the pool is capped and can grow to the point of saturation. Stakeholders become delegators. Let's add that by delegating, stakeholders are essentially putting their trust in a selected pool. It is a kind of voting process.\nDuring the process of delegation, the coins still remain in the owner's wallet and are not locked. The owner cannot lose the coins and can even spend them at any time. Time is divided into epochs of 5 days in the Cardano ecosystem. Between the transition from epoch to epoch, a so-called snapshot is taken, during which the exact number of ADA coins in the wallets involved in the staking is scanned.\nStakeholders may spend some of ADA coins or, conversely, acquire new ones. During the snapshot, the current state is taken into account. If the stakeholders have delegated to a pool producing blocks, in a few epochs they will start receiving regular rewards. The rewards are automatically counted into the staking during subsequent snapshots. A staker can delegate to another pool at any time.\nThe process of staking and delegation is similar in principle to bitcoin mining, but more inclusive. There is no need to acquire expensive hardware and pay electricity bills, so anyone who owns ADA coins can get involved.\nFor more information, stake analysis and exploring, visit cardano explorer (cexplorer.io)\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Welcome to the age of RealFi?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nJohn O'Connor - African Operations Director\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: November 25, 2021\nSummary:\nBy integrating digital identity with Cardano, we can create real value and opportunity for people across the globe\nArticle:\n\"The point of RealFi is to serve real people real finance, and thus be able to innovate and do interesting things.\nCharles Hoskinson\nWhen it comes to the story of blockchain s recent evolution, it is decentralized finance (DeFi) that has taken center stage. DeFi uses smart contracts on a blockchain to give anyone access to banking using a public, decentralized, ledger. By removing the middlemen, the bankers, and the brokers, DeFi has brought in a new generation of users and the sector has enjoyed meteoric growth, now estimated to be worth some $100 billion.\nDeFi is an open financial network. People do not need to go through any one private enterprise, such as PayPal, Western Union, or a bank, to send, borrow, or lend money. Instead, this is done between individuals, in a peer-to-peer fashion, using blockchain as the underlying ledger to support and enable the transaction.\nThe basic concept of DeFi is sound. Loans are typically fully-, or over-collateralized. This is because little (or in some cases, nothing) is known about the borrower, and there is little recourse if the loan is not paid. Also, borrowing is normally re-invested in further crypto opportunities. Users interact in a peer-to-peer fashion with no central governing body, relying instead on smart contracts and the inherent transparency and immutability of blockchain-based systems. In this way, most of the usual regulatory constraints around lending and borrowing do not apply, while fees tend to be significantly lower.\n\"It is our belief that over the next 12 to 24 months the majority of DeFi providers will be systematically upgrading to RealFi, to actually encumber identity, and metadata, to create proper standards and make sure they're secure and functional and to ensure they resolve the issues of regulation and governance, and also they're in the market for new customers.\"\nCharles Hoskinson\nAmong nations with developed economic systems, DeFi has highlighted the potential for blockchain to disrupt financial legacy systems and open up access to new users hunting for better yields and moving liquidity around. It has established an entirely new financial paradigm and the $100bn DeFi market is expected to grow significantly over the next few years as models continue to evolve.\nHowever, as much as the age of DeFi is creating fresh markets and driving compelling new use cases, it has also further highlighted the economic divide between people who can easily access financial products, and those who cannot.\nPricing credit is about trying to assess and mitigate the risk of default. Traditional consumer finance and credit reduce risk by understanding how borrowers behave how much they spend, their income, and so on. DeFi's approach to risk mitigation is different.\nA mature credit scoring system is key to delivering credit in developed economies. But it is even more critical in emerging markets. The reason why banks refuse credit or loans in emerging markets is often that they don t have enough data about the person or organization intending to borrow. The systems are either less sophisticated or simply not there. It is impossible to create an accurate financial picture through a credit score.\nHowever, it is possible to build up a credit score by querying proxies, linked to an identity. You could contact utility companies to check if the customer has always paid their bills, or check with a phone provider to see how often the prospective borrower topped up their mobile. An identity is out there, the problem is how to tie data to the identity. Once that is achieved, the data can be presented to a local bank, microfinance initiative or a decentralized pool of capital provided by people across the world in the Cardano community.\nWe have now reached a point when we can enable this through innovations in crypto. All the necessary financial information can be stored and relayed in a verifiable manner through an Atala PRISM ID. The monetary building bricks of DeFi can be used to structure these loans and hedge the currency risk, while scalable payment rails provided by Cardano and various layer 2 solutions will make it possible to transfer capital across the world without friction.\nThis year we have announced two very significant blockchain agreements. Our partnership with the Ethiopian Ministry for Education is creating a national attainment recording system to verify grades, monitor school performance, and boost nationwide education. Meanwhile, our collaboration with World Mobile in Tanzania will connect the unconnected and enable access to essential online services through blockchain.\nPowerful deals like these are the jumping-off point for Cardano's mission to build RealFi: real finance targeted at the people who really need new ways to access finance, creating that real value often missing from DeFi. RealFi is an ecosystem of products that remove the frictions between crypto liquidity and real-world economic activities to offer attractive yields to crypto holders, and cheaper credit/ financial products for real people.\nCardano adds the final piece of the financial puzzle by unlocking real economic value at the end of the transaction chain: personal identity.\nIdentity is central to everything. Once someone has an economic identity, a world of opportunity and inclusivity opens up. Real opportunity comes with access to essential services that were hitherto out of reach. And real finance, such as loans to open a business or maintain an existing one. RealFi.\nIdentity can become an asset in so far as it can be a substitute for collateral. A lender's overriding concern is to ensure that loans (plus any interest accrued) are paid back. One way of enforcing this is by collateralizing the loan, but if the lender has enough and clear information about a borrower (if they know the borrower is a high-earner or a long-standing customer), the lender might be more inclined to forgo the collateral.\nMicrolending platforms such as Kiva offer a successful business model, perfectly suited to the African continent's emerging economy. In this environment, small loans can be life-changing for farmers, entrepreneurs, and people with the drive to create and succeed.\nBut access to finance is only part of a larger picture. Without access to insurance, education, and health services, people would still be exposed to huge risks. RealFi, through the power of blockchain and a digital identity platform like Atala PRISM, offers a comprehensive solution to this quandary. Digital identity enables access to not only financial products but also to services that enable people to thrive on a level playing field with their counterparts in more developed parts of the world.\n\"Cardano has always been about entering the developing world. We really want to focus on the 3 billion people who don't have reliable access to financial services. If we look at a lot of the markets that we play in, we're super excited to bring those markets in through identity and through wallets into the cryptocurrency space, and then giving them access to RealFi, so for the first time ever, they can participate in a global market fairly.\"\nCharles Hoskinson\nRealFi will herald a new age of on-chain credit activity. Cardano owners currently hold coins worth $80bn, and many of them will soon be looking for more yield options besides staking. The tangibility of this real-world application of crypto, the provision of real finance to real people, is the switch that can light up Cardano's power and uniqueness. This is the real use case that many people fail to see in cryptocurrencies. RealFi marks a new era of on-chain credit activity. With a validated identity, someone in Rome might have the confidence to make an uncollateralized loan to a business in Kenya, for example.\nTo start down this road, IO has partnered with Pezesha to facilitate loans to small and medium-sized businesses looking for short-term loans for working capital. These loans have a default rate of just 2 , but struggle to be funded in the Kenyan market due to a lack of local liquidity. The goal is to build simple friction-free tools that enable crypto holders to seamlessly lend into real-world opportunities, receiving repayments in crypto directly into their wallets. We see a world where people can lend into real-world opportunities as seamlessly as they do crypto.\nRealFi represents the very antithesis of financial exclusion and heralds the arrival of a new era of financial and societal inclusivity in Africa and elsewhere. Through RealFi, Cardano becomes a beacon of identity provision to help people help themselves. RealFi's mission is the creation of real financial value for real people, and the key differentiator between Cardano and other blockchain platforms.\nThe Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Kenya projects are the first steps of a much longer journey towards global fairness and inclusiveness. The start of a drive to end the marginalization of the disadvantaged whilst offering attractive yields to cryptocurrency holders. Much like DeFi, RealFi will be an ecosystem of products and technologies that reduce the friction between Crypto liquidity and real-world economic opportunities. Through RealFi, we want to make the world smaller, connecting everyone into a global community of capital and opportunity that's now open and welcoming to them.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Vasil upgrade the state of play?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nNigel Hemsley - Head of Delivery and Projects\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: June 20, 2022\nSummary:\nVery close but a little further still to go. Here s an update on the progress towards the Vasil upgrade\nArticle:\nOn Friday, the core Input Output Global (IOG) team working toward the Vasil upgrade held its regular end-of-week evaluation call. Today (Monday, June 20) was the latest date that we could facilitate a Cardano testnet upgrade before the next epoch boundary, so we agreed to re-evaluate the latest status this afternoon, taking into account the work our engineers did over the weekend.\nThe IOG engineering team is extremely close to finalizing the core work, with just seven bugs still outstanding to complete the hard fork work, with none currently ranked as severe . After some consideration, we have agreed NOT to send the hard fork update proposal to the testnet today to allow more time for testing.\nTo date, we ve managed to get through the majority (approx 95 ) of our Plutus V2 test scripts. However, we still have a few outstanding items that we need to run to confirm everything is working as expected. We have determined we'll need a few more days for this. This puts us behind schedule on our previously communicated target date of June 29 for a mainnet hard fork.\nSince the start of June, we have been successfully running an early build of the new node (which includes diffusion pipelining and the new Plutus v2 CIPs among other enhancements) as a semi-public Vasil developer testnet (Devnet). We now have some 35 developers from across 27 projects testing their DApps and helping identify any issues, along with 16 stake pool operators (SPOs) supporting. We re also working closely with some of the leading tool/API providers, including Blockfrost, Cardano Serialization library (EMURGO), and Cardano Multiplatform Library (dcSpark). We want to call out the work of Mlabs and Dquadrant in particular for providing great support throughout the process. This developer testnet stage puts us in a good position when it comes to Plutus code compatibility and functionality. This valuable work will continue on this development testnet over the next few weeks.\nThe work on Vasil has been the most complex program of development and integration to date, from several angles. It's a challenging process that requires not only significant work from core teams but also close coordination across the ecosystem.\nThe final decision to hard fork the Cardano Testnet will be made in consultation with members of the SPO and DApp development community against 3 key criteria:\nNo critical issues outstanding on node (including ledger, CLI, consensus, etc.) or our internal audit function,\nBenchmarking and performance-cost analysis is acceptable, and\nCommunity (including exchanges and DApp projects) has been properly informed and has had sufficient time to prepare for the hard fork combinator event.\nThe project continues to track well against these criteria. Once we can comfortably and confidently tick all these boxes, we can move forward and hard fork the Cardano testnet, marking the final countdown to the mainnet hard fork. The Cardano Foundation integration team leads this process and typically aims to give exchanges 4 weeks to finish their own integrations/updates. The Pareto principle tends to be followed here - aiming to achieve 80 exchange compliance (by liquidity) before mainnet hard fork thus minimizing inconvenience for users while recognizing different exchanges can work to different timelines.\nToday, IOG and the Cardano Foundation have agreed on a new target date to hard fork the testnet at the end of June. Once completed, we will then allow four weeks for exchanges and SPOs to carry out any required integration and testing work. This is only reasonable and should not be rushed. The working assumption should therefore now be a Cardano mainnet hard fork occurring during the last week of July.\nWe recognize that this news will be disappointing to some. However, we are taking an abundance of caution to ensure that we do this deployment correctly.\nAs we have consistently communicated, and most in the community recognize, no timelines can be absolute in software development. Quality and security must remain paramount. If more time is needed to get the core code right - and ensure all ecosystem players (SPOs, DApp projects, tools, exchanges, etc.) are fully comfortable so be it. Giving the process longer is the only responsible thing to do.\nThe IOG and Cardano Foundation teams will continue to work closely with the developer community and exchanges as we draw closer to the Vasil hard fork on mainnet. And to keep the updates to the community coming.

    "prompt": "The Ouroboros path to decentralization?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nProf Aggelos Kiayias - Chief Scientist\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: June 23, 2020\nSummary:\nThe protocol that powers Cardano and its design philosophy\nArticle:\nDesigning and deploying a distributed ledger is a technically challenging task. What is expected of a ledger is the promise of a consistent view to all participants as well as a guarantee of responsiveness to the continuous flow of events that result from their actions. These two properties, sometimes referred to as persistence and liveness, are the hallmark of distributed ledger systems.\nAchieving persistence and liveness in a centralized system is a well-studied and fairly straightforward task; unfortunately, the ledger that emerges is precariously brittle because the server that supports the ledger becomes a single point of failure. As a result, hacking the server can lead to the instant violation of both properties. Even if the server is not hacked, the interests of the server s operators may not align with the continuous assurance of these properties. For this reason, decentralization has been advanced as an essential remedy.\nInformally, decentralization refers to a system architecture that calls for many entities to act individually in such a way that the ledger s properties emerge from the convergence of their actions. In exchange for this increase in complexity, a well-designed system can continue to function even if some parties deviate from proper operation. Moreover, in the case of more significant deviations, even if some disruption is unavoidable, the system should still be capable of returning to normal operation and containing the damage.\nHow does one design a robust decentralized system? The world is a complicated place and decentralization is not a characteristic that can be hard-coded or demonstrated via testing the potential configurations that might arise are infinite. To counter this, one must develop models that systematically encompass all the different threats the system may encounter and demonstrate rigorously that the two basic properties of persistence and liveness are upheld.\nThe strongest arguments for the reliability of a decentralized system combine formal guarantees against a broad portfolio of different classes of failure and attack models. The first important class is that of powerful Byzantine models. In this setting, it should be guaranteed that even if a subset of participants arbitrarily deviates from the rules, the two fundamental properties are retained. The second important class is models of rationality. Here, participants are assumed to be rational utility maximizers and the objective is to show that the ledger properties arise from their efforts to pursue their self-interest.\nOuroboros is a decentralized ledger protocol that is analyzed in the context of both Byzantine and rational behavior. What makes the protocol unique is the combination of the following design elements.\nIt uses stake as the fundamental resource to identify the participants leverage in the system. No physical resource is wasted in the process of ledger maintenance, which is shown to be robust despite costless simulation and nothing at stake attacks that were previously thought to be fundamental barriers to stake-based ledgers. This makes Ouroboros distinctly more appealing than proof-of-work protocols, which require prodigious energy expenditure to maintain consensus.\nIt is proven to be resilient even if arbitrarily large subsets of participants, in terms of stake, abstain from ledger maintenance. This guarantee of dynamic availability ensures liveness even under arbitrary, and unpredictable, levels of engagement. At the same time, of those participants who are active, barely more than half need to follow the protocol the rest can arbitrarily deviate; in fact, even temporary spikes above the 50 threshold can be tolerated. Thus Ouroboros is distinctly more resilient and adaptable than classical Byzantine fault tolerance protocols (as well as all their modern adaptations), which have to predict with relative certainty the level of expected participation and may stop operating when the prediction is false.\nThe process of joining and participating in the protocol execution is trustless in the sense that it does not require the availability of any special shared resource such as a recent checkpoint or a common clock. Engaging in the protocol requires merely the public genesis block of the chain and access to the network. This makes Ouroboros free of the trust assumptions common in other consensus protocols whose security collapses when trusted shared resources are subverted or unavailable.\nOuroboros incorporates a reward-sharing mechanism to incentivize participants to organize themselves in operational nodes, known as stake pools, that can offer a good quality of service independently of how the stake is distributed among the user population. In this way, all stakeholders contribute to the system s operation ensuring robustness and democratic representation while the cost of ledger maintenance is efficiently distributed across the user population. At the same time, the mechanism comes with countermeasures that de-incentivize centralization. This makes Ouroboros fundamentally more inclusive and decentralized compared with other protocols that either end up with just a handful of actors responsible for ledger maintenance or provide no incentives to stakeholders to participate and offer a good quality of service.\nThese design elements of Ouroboros are not supposed to be self-evident appeals to the common sense of the protocol user. Instead, they were delivered with meticulous documentation in papers that have undergone peer review and appeared in top-tier conferences and publications in the area of cybersecurity and cryptography. Indeed, it is fair to say that no other consensus research effort is represented so comprehensively in these circles. Each paper is explicit about the specific type of model that is used to analyze the protocol and the results derived are laid out in concrete terms. The papers are open-access, patent-free, and include all technical details to allow anyone, with the relevant technical expertise, to convince themselves of the veracity of the claims made about performance, security, and functionality.\nBuilding an inclusive, fair, and resilient infrastructure for financial and social applications on a global scale is the grand challenge of information technology today. Ouroboros contributes, not just as a protocol with unique characteristics, but also by presenting a design methodology that highlights first principles, careful modeling, and rigorous analysis. Its modular and adaptable architecture also lends itself to continuous improvement, adaptation, and enrichment with additional elements (such as parallelization to improve scalability or zero-knowledge proofs to improve privacy, to name two examples), which is a befitting characteristic to meet the ever-evolving needs and complexities of the real world.\nTo delve deeper into the Ouroboros protocol, from its inception to recent new features, follow these links:\nOuroboros (Classic): the first provably secure proof-of-stake blockchain protocol.\nOuroboros Praos: removes the need for a rigid round structure and improves resilience against adaptive attackers.\nOuroboros Genesis: how to avoid the need for a recent checkpoint and prove the protocol is secure under dynamic availability for trustless joining and participating.\nOuroboros Chronos: removes the need for a common clock.\nReward sharing schemes for stake pools.\nAccount management and maximizing participation in stake pools.\nOptimizing transaction throughput with proof-of-stake protocols.\nFast settlement using ledger combiners.\nOuroboros Crypsinous: a privacy-preserving proof-of-stake protocol.\nKachina: a unified security model for private smart contracts.\nHydra: an off-chain scalability architecture for high transaction throughput with low latency, and minimal storage per node.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Plutus Application Backend PAB supporting DApp development on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nFernando Sanchez - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: October 28, 2021\nSummary:\nThe PAB provides the components and an environment to help developers create and test DApps, before deploying them to a live production environment\nArticle:\nThe Alonzo protocol upgrade introduced Plutus a platform that provides a native smart contract language along with the necessary infrastructure and tools to support smart contracts on Cardano. The Plutus platform enables developers to write decentralized applications (DApps) with scripting capabilities that interact with distributed ledgers.\nTo understand Plutus, one has to recognize three concepts:\nThe Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model\nPlutus Core the on-chain part of Plutus\nThe Plutus Application Framework (PAF) Plutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user s machine (off-chain or client code)\nBoth the on-chain and off-chain code are written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs.\nIn a previous blog post, we discussed the on- and off-chain functionality of core components of Plutus in greater detail. Here, let s dive deeper into Plutus off-chain capabilities and take a look at the Plutus Application Backend (PAB).\nIn the UTXO model, we have off-chain infrastructure that builds the transactions that move the apps along. This off-chain infrastructure is quite complicated because it needs to look at the ledger state, pick some information from the ledger, and put it all together to build a transaction with the right pieces of data in the right place. The PAB is a single Haskell library that makes it easier to write this off-chain infrastructure and the on-chain scripts.\nThe PAB helps with building the UTXO transactions in two ways:\nThe read path - That is, getting information from the chain, and reacting to events that happen on the blockchain. The read path is currently working on the testnet\nThe write path - This is where we actually construct the transactions that run the Plutus scripts\nThe PAB is a key component of the Plutus Application Framework (PAF) that enables developers to create and test DApps locally, before deploying them to a live production environment. A little like the Marlowe Playground provides a sandbox for devs to create and test financial smart contracts, the PAB offers a similar environment for devs to create and test full DApps.\nThe PAB is an off-chain, backend service for managing and handling the requirements of the application instance throughout its lifecycle. This includes interaction with external clients (such as wallet frontends) and acts as an intermediary between Plutus Applications, the node, the wallet backend, and end-users. Such interaction is made possible by PAB commands and mock components that enable convenient simulations and integration of DApps.\nWhile not a prerequisite for DApp creation or implementation some developers are creating their own tools and indeed API-based alternatives are being worked on by the community the PAB removes the need for developers to create their own infrastructure from scratch (including chain index, etc.) reducing development time and resources needed. It allows developers to simulate how an application would behave on-chain for prior testing and error elimination, to ensure a flawless transition for launch.\nThe purpose of the PAB is to:\nprovide a standardized environment for Plutus applications to run in\npresent discoverable interfaces to the external clients\ntrack on-chain information for smart contract uses\nallow the developer to work in an emulated or non-emulated environment\nThe PAB can switch between emulated and non-emulated (real network) environments seamlessly. This makes it easier to write all kinds of different tests unit tests, integration tests, property based tests, etc. The PAB allows DApps to easily communicate with it as the backend can receive and deliver messages. Thus, the DApp can send usual requests to endpoints that the PAB has exposed, and which correspond to actions and operations that any particular smart contract is capable of handling.\nApplications deployed using the framework s libraries can run on the PAB, which provides runtime support for access to the blockchain to further perform smart contract operations triggering transactions based on the EUTXO model. Additionally, PAB features functionality for persistence, logging, and monitoring.\nEarlier this summer, we deployed the first in a series of color-coded testnets to bring core Plutus smart contract capability to Cardano. This was deployed on mainnet via the Alonzo hard fork. Smart contract capability is currently accessible using a Command Line Interface (CLI). While the first simple smart contracts were enabled on mainnet in early September, this was always the first stage in the road to DApp deployment on mainnet.\nDevelopers have meanwhile been working on their DApps (many via the PAB) locally while testing any core smart contract functionality on the testnet. These elements need to come together before an DApp hits mainnet and this takes time. Once the PAB is integrated with the node and other core components such as the wallet back end (WBE) connector, developers will be able to move their DApps into a state of readiness and bring them to the Cardano testnet prior to mainnet launch.\nThese early applications built locally will then be able to interact with the mainnet as intended. The mockchain approach to development to date means that for DApp creators, it will be a smooth transition from testnet to mainnet. All it takes is a change in the configuration files to start the PAB, it requires no changes to the actual code or to the Haskell code. This integration work is complex and a critical part of Cardano infrastructure so we need to ensure it is done correctly. We re continuing to work on the final integrations and based on the current trajectory, we plan to deliver the integration in November, assuming we don t encounter any critical issues.\nThis is just the start. As always, this will be an iterative process. With the evolution of the Plutus platform, we will be inviting the developer community to deploy their own tooling and create off-chain code for their DApps running on Cardano. We have already seen a hive of activity in this area, through both the Alonzo testnet program and Project Catalyst.

    "completion": "Original author:\nDor Garbash - Head of Product\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: February 12, 2021\nSummary:\nThe next Catalyst funding round will be our most accessible and ambitious round of funding yet\nArticle:\nWe launched Project Catalyst six months ago as a series of experiments to advance on-chain governance and accelerate community-driven innovation on Cardano. The project seeks to achieve the highest levels of community collaboration and to seed the best ideas with development funding via a community-moderated process. Community, innovation, funding, value, growth Catalyst creates powerful synergies, and ultimately a self-sustaining engine of growth for Cardano s future.\nEach funding round has grown in its scope, level of funding, and community engagement. We already have 7,000 members on the IdeaScale innovation platform with 1,800 active voters. Adoption is growing by 10 every week and we have only just begun.\nFund4 will be our most accessible and ambitious round yet and our first million-dollar round that s the size of the ada pot to fund development projects on Cardano. Proposal teams will use these funds to develop tooling, build decentralized applications, launch education and training initiatives for developers, and so much more. Every fresh contribution adds fresh value to the ecosystem. And since the community is at the core of Catalyst, 20 of treasury funds are set aside to reward and incentivize community advisers, referrers, and participating voters for their contribution.\nThroughout 2021, we will continue to encourage engagement with the project across the Cardano community by making it more accessible. In Fund3, voter registration has been significantly improved. Registration is now fully integrated with the Daedalus wallet, within a new registration center. This replaces a separate user-unfriendly and time-consuming process we had to use in Fund2 for technical reasons, now addressed. For Yoroi light wallet users, a browser extension provides easy registration. Voters will then use a dedicated mobile voting app downloadable on iOS or Android to complete the process. In a future Daedalus release, users will ultimately be able to register and vote from the wallet. To participate in voting you need to meet a threshold currently set at 3,000 ada - a threshold set to help protect the voting system from malicious attacks. To get a Cardano wallet, make sure to download Daedalus only from its official site or use the official Yoroi browser extension.\nIn less than half a year, Project Catalyst has grown to become the world s largest decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It is a fulcrum of future development and sustainable innovation, driven by the Cardano community, for the Cardano community. This latest fund is a huge step up for the proposers, advisers, and voters collaborating already. We want to encourage everyone to become part of bringing on-chain governance to Cardano.\nIf you are an ada holder and you want to influence and contribute to the future direction for Cardano, then bring your ideas and join us at Project Catalyst.\n*Please note, due to an editing error, a previous version of this blog erroneously stated that voter registration and voting would be included in the forthcoming Daedalus release. Our apologies for any confusion.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Nosurprises transaction validation part 2?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nPolina Vinogradova - Research Engineer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: September 7, 2021\nSummary:\nAlonzo transaction validation is performed in two phases to ensure fair compensation for validation work\nArticle:\nIn our previous blog post, we discussed the deterministic nature of transaction and script validation on the Alonzo ledger, which provides assurance that the outcome of on-chain transaction application and script validation can be accurately predicted locally, before the transaction is ever submitted.\nRelying on the guarantees provided by the deterministic design of the Alonzo ledger, we have implemented a specific two-phase validation scheme. It is designed to minimize the resources the nodes use to validate network transactions while also eliminating unexpected costs for the user. In this blog post, we dive deeper into how the two-phase validation works.\nIn the Shelley, Allegra, and Mary eras, transaction validation was a one-step process. The effect of a valid transaction on the ledger was fully predictable before it was applied. If a transaction was valid, it got included into a block and added to the ledger. If not, a node would reject it after a failed validation attempt and the transaction would not be included in a block. However, nodes that validated incoming transactions used time and resources, regardless of whether or not the transaction ended up in a block.\nAlonzo introduces Plutus scripts, which might require significantly more resources to validate them compared to simple scripts in previous eras. To address the issue of nodes expending resources on validating scripts of transactions that get rejected, Alonzo introduces a two-phase validation approach. This strategy maintains a predictable outcome of applying transactions to the ledger, and also ensures fair compensation to the nodes for their work and resource usage.\nTransaction validation on Cardano is divided into two phases. The main reason for introducing two-phase validation is to limit the amount of uncompensated validation work by nodes. Each phase serves a purpose in achieving this goal. Roughly speaking, the first phase checks whether the transaction is constructed correctly and can pay its processing fee. The second phase runs the scripts included in the transaction. If the transaction is phase-1 valid, phase-2 scripts run. If phase-1 fails, no scripts run, and the transaction is immediately discarded.\nThus, nodes are expected to add processable transactions to a block even if the transactions are not phase-2 valid. This means that either:\na small amount of uncompensated work is done by a node to find out that a transaction is not processable, but no expensive phase-2 validation is done, or\nthe transaction is processable. The node can then perform phase-2 validation of the scripts, tag the transaction accordingly as either phase-2 valid or phase-2 invalid, and add it to a block. In either case, the node will later be compensated for both phases of validation via the fee or collateral collected from this transaction.\nThe expectation is that phase-2 failure should be rare, because a user submitting a transaction with failing scripts will lose ada while achieving nothing. This is locally predictable, and therefore a preventable event. The phase is a required safeguard to guarantee compensation for scripts potentially resource-intensive computation.\nLet s take a closer look at the specifics of each phase.\nPhase 1\nThe first phase of validation must be simple. If this phase fails, a node does not get compensated for the work it has done, as it cannot accept processing fees from unprocessable transactions.\nPhase-1 validation verifies two things: that a transaction is constructed correctly, and that it is possible to add it to the ledger. This validation includes the following checks and some additional ones:\nit pays the correct amount of fees and provides the correct amount of collateral (i.e. ada collected in the case of script failure, explained below)\nit includes all the data required for executing Plutus scripts\nit does not exceed any bounds set in the protocol parameters (on output sizes, etc.)\nits inputs refer to UTXOs existing on the ledger\nthe stated computational budget for the transaction does not exceed the maximum resource limit per transaction\nintegrity hash checks, etc.\nBefore adding an incoming transaction to the mempool (and eventually, to a block), a node must perform all phase-1 validation checks. If any of these checks fail, the transaction is rejected without being included into a block, and no fees are charged. In previous eras, this was the only validation phase, and Cardano handled all validation failures in this fashion.\nHonest, non-compromised nodes are not expected to intentionally produce unprocessable transactions. Nodes can also drop connections performing adversarial dissemination of phase-1 invalid transactions.\nPhase 2\nThe second phase of validation runs Plutus scripts, which can be more computationally expensive. Therefore, fees are charged following either a success or a failure in the second phase. Collected ada goes into the fee pot, and thus compensates nodes for the resources used in the validation process.\nSuccessful phase-1 validation does not guarantee that all of the transaction s actions are processable, only that collection of the collateral is possible. Phase-2 performs Plutus script validation, and the decision of whether to perform full processing or only collect collateral is made based on the outcome of validation:\nfully apply the transaction (the only possibility prior to Alonzo) if the Plutus scripts validate all the actions of the transaction, or\ncollect the collateral ada and ignore the rest of the transaction if one of the Plutus scripts fails .\nRecall that script validation has a locally predictable outcome and is guaranteed to terminate. Users can locally check script validation outcomes, and there will be no disagreement between honest nodes on how to process a given transaction and the scripts therein.\nCollateral\nIf scripts don't validate, we still need to compensate the nodes for their work. But we can't just take money from the transaction inputs, because those might have been locked with scripts - those that failed! So instead, Alonzo introduces a special provision for this. The collateral of a transaction is the amount of ada that will be collected as a fee in case of a phase-2 script validation failure. In a processable transaction, this amount must be at least a certain percentage of the transaction fee, specified in a protocol parameter.\nThis amount is specified at the time of constructing the transaction. Not directly, but by adding collateral inputs to the transaction. The total balance in the UTXOs corresponding to these specially marked inputs is the transaction s collateral amount. These UTXOs must have public key (rather than script) addresses and contain no tokens other than ada.\nThe collateral inputs get removed from the ledger UTXO only if any script fails phase-2 validation. If all scripts pass, the specified transaction fee amount gets collected, as in previous eras. In particular, the amount comes from the regular, non-collateral inputs, and the collateral inputs are simply ignored. And, good news! It is permitted to use the same inputs as both collateral and regular, since only one of the two sets ever gets removed from the UTXO.\nThe signatures required to validate the spending of collateral inputs also play an important role in maintaining the integrity of a transaction. They do so by preventing adversaries from altering its contents so that it continues to be processable but fails phase-2 validation. An example of this would be an adversary replacing a redeemer. Collateral key holders signatures are required to make such a change. The collateral key holders are also the only users who stand to lose any ada if script validation fails.\nSince script evaluation is deterministic, the collateral key holders are able to check locally whether the transaction will pass phase-2 validation on-chain before they sign it. If it does, then they can be sure it will also do so on-chain, and they will definitely not lose their collateral. A user acting in good faith should never lose their collateral. It also means that they can reuse the same collateral inputs for multiple transactions, and be sure the collateral is not collected.\nNow that we have launched the public Alonzo testnet, we welcome all users and developers to assess it by building and executing Plutus scripts. You can find out more information in the dedicated Alonzo testnet repository, or discuss Plutus and Alonzo topics with our diverse community.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Nosurprises transaction validation on Cardano?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nPolina Vinogradova - Research Engineer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: September 6, 2021\nSummary:\nCardano's EUTXO model enables the deterministic nature of Plutus script execution\nArticle:\nAs the Alonzo hard fork brings core Plutus smart contract capability to Cardano, the ledger evolves to meet the growing need for the deployment of decentralized solutions. Cardano ledger design focuses on high assurance, security, and proven formal verification. In alignment with this strategy, it is also important to ensure that transaction processing is deterministic, meaning that a user can predict its impact and outcome before the actual execution.\nThe ability to guarantee the cost of transaction execution, and how the transaction behaves on the ledger before it is submitted, becomes even more prominent with the introduction of smart contract support. Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)-based blockchains, like Cardano, provide such capabilities. Account-based blockchains, like Ethereum, are indeterministic, which means that they cannot guarantee the predictability of the transaction s effect on-chain. This presents risks of monetary loss, unpredictably high fees, and additional opportunities for adversarial behavior.\nIn this blog post, we take a closer look at the benefits of Cardano s deterministic design that allows for secure transaction and script evaluation before execution. In the following blog post, coming later this week, we discuss the two phases of transaction validation on Cardano.\nDeterminism, in the context of transaction and script processing, is a synonym for predictability. This means that a user can predict locally (off-chain) how their transaction will impact the on-chain state of the ledger, without:\nA transaction in a deterministic system might yet be rejected, even if constructed correctly. Rejected means that the transaction could not be applied to the ledger at all, therefore having no effect on its state, so no fees are paid. The reason this would happen is due to ledger changes caused by other transactions processed between the time when the initial transaction is constructed and the time it is processed. This can happen even with simple transactions. For example, another transaction might spend a UTXO that a user was also planning to spend. Determinism ensures that, whenever a transaction is accepted, it will only have predictable effects on the ledger state.\nIndeterminism means that we cannot predict what effects a transaction will have on the ledger before execution. When designing the ledger, as well as a smart contract interpreter, it is important to foresee conditions in which indeterminism might occur, and make design decisions to avoid them. One of the main hazards in such a case is access to mutable ledger data, that is data that can be changed or altered. When the changes a transaction or a smart contract make to the ledger depend on its state at the time of processing, rather than only the contents of the transaction, indeterminism might become an issue.\nEthereum is notably susceptible to this problem. For example, gas prices, or a decentralized exchange (DEX) rate can fluctuate between the time a user submits a transaction and the time it gets processed. This results in unexpected gas fees, or price changes of assets being purchased. Or a script might simply fail, resulting in high execution costs (hundreds of dollars) and no other effect. This could occur, for instance, if the funds available to cover the gas costs run out mid-execution. Deterministic ledger design eliminates these possibilities.\nOther possible sources of indeterminism include allowing scripts to see:\nIn most systems, there are ways to mitigate these issues with improved script-writing practices, or layer-2 solutions. Cardano is designed to guarantee predictable outcomes for all scripts and transactions.\nThe Cardano ledger is built on a UTXO accounting model, which means that assets are stored on the ledger in unspent outputs, rather than in accounts. Each of these outputs specifies quantities of assets stored therein, together with its address. Unspent outputs are immutable, so a transaction might consume the entire output, but it cannot alter it.\nTo transfer assets, a transaction consumes one or more outputs and creates new ones, which, in total, contain the same quantities of assets as the ones consumed. These quantities -and their UTXO addresses- are specified in the outputs of the transaction. The only way a transaction can influence the effect of another transaction applied to the ledger is by spending the same UTXO as the later transaction attempts to spend, thus causing the node to reject it. This is the key feature on which the UTXO model relies for maintaining determinism.\nA UTXO ledger has both benefits and drawbacks over the account-based model. The latter will encounter fewer instances of transactions blocking one another, for example. Unlike UTXOs, accounts are mutable ledger data. So a transaction might see, for example, a different quantity of assets in an account, depending on whether it was processed before or after another transaction that updates that same account. This circumstance might not cause the transaction to be rejected, but it could result in different and unpredictable changes to the ledger.\nSpending a UTXO is just one example of an action a transaction can take. Next, we explain what transaction actions are, and how they can be validated. The most significant set of changes introduced in Alonzo are changes to the process of action validation.\nAn important aspect of processing a transaction is validating the actions it is taking. A transaction is taking an action when it contains data in the specific field to that action. For example, a transaction is spending UTXO U when it contains a reference to U in its input field, and it is minting a token X when its mint field contains X.\nWhen the node processes a transaction, it verifies whether it can perform the action it intends to. For this, the author of the transaction must provide relevant pieces of data, e.g., scripts, redeemers, or signatures. A common example of an action that requires validation is spending a UTXO locked with a public key. The transaction must provide a signature from the corresponding private key to perform this action.\nCardano uses scripts to validate actions. These scripts, which are pieces of code, implement pure functions with True or False outputs. Script validation is the process of invoking the script interpreter to run a given script on appropriate arguments.\nScript validation can be performed for the following actions:\nBesides letting the node know which script to run, all transaction actions indicate how to assemble arguments passed to that script.\nCardano s multi-asset ledger (Mary) supports simple multisig and timelock scripting languages. These allow users to specify signatures required to perform an action (such as spending a UTXO or minting a non-fungible token (NFT)), and the time interval in which it can be performed. A timelock script can never see the actual slot number in the transaction that includes it. Timelock can only see the validity interval of the carrying transaction. Allowing a timelock script to see the current slot number (i.e., data coming from the block, rather than the author) would break determinism. This is ensured by the fact that a user cannot know the exact slot in which the transaction gets processed, and therefore they cannot predict how the script will behave.\nMary scripts, unlike Plutus contracts in Alonzo, are very limited in what they can express. The Alonzo hard fork ushers in a new era of powerful, stateful contracts that do not compromise the deterministic ledger property.\nAlonzo introduces a new approach to transaction validation on Cardano due to the implementation of Plutus scripts. The extended unspent transaction output (EUTXO) model, deployed as part of Alonzo, provides the ledger infrastructure to support Plutus contracts. Below, we provide a high-level overview of ledger and transaction changes. For more details about working with the ledger and Plutus scripts, check out the Plutus Pioneer program!\nAlonzo changes the data on the ledger as follows:\nTo support Plutus scripts, transactions have been upgraded as follows:\nThere are also some changes to the specifics of Alonzo transaction validation as compared to Mary. For each action, the node assembles script arguments expected by the Plutus interpreter, including:\nThe node performs new, Alonzo-specific checks that ensure the transaction is constructed correctly. For example, it must not exceed the maximum execution resource budget. It also invokes the Plutus script interpreter to run the scripts.\nDatum objects vs script state\nLike mutable accounts, mutable script state falls squarely into the mutable ledger data category of indeterminism sources. We already saw that the UTXO model avoids the mutable accounts indeterminism issue. It can also help us reimagine the concept of script state in a way that maintains determinism. If a UTXO is locked by a Plutus script, that UTXO s script code is associated with its address. The state-analog of this script is the datum stored in that UTXO. When a transaction spends that UTXO, it gets deleted from the ledger, including the datum. However, the contents of the Plutus script could enforce that the transaction carrying it must also create a UTXO containing a specific datum that can be viewed as the updated script state.\nScript execution budget\nThe non-deterministic gas model can charge users unpredictably large fees. In Cardano scripts, this source of indeterminism is addressed by requiring that the resource budget itself, as well as the fee required to cover this budget, are included in the transaction. In Alonzo, a user can predict both locally when constructing the transaction. Script execution necessarily returns either True or False, and will not loop indefinitely. The reason for this is that every operation a script performs takes a non-zero amount of resources, which are tracked by the interpreter. If the budget specified by the transaction is exceeded, script execution terminates and returns False.\nAddressing the possible sources of indeterminism, the following key points make the outcomes of script and transaction validation predictable:\nThe last point is largely inherited from the UTXO model, as Alonzo ledger protocol updates remain, for the most part, consistent with updates in previous eras (including the delegation scheme, etc.). After the Alonzo upgrade, script validation failure or success does affect how a transaction is processed (more about this in part 2!). However, the True or False outcome, as well as ledger changes associated with either outcome, are predictable for a given transaction.\nThe deterministic behavior of Cardano s script and transaction validation is not a natural outcome of using the EUTXO model. To ensure this property, the IOG team had to carefully track the source of every piece of data which a script is allowed to see.\nThe deterministic evaluation property is formally specified in the Alonzo specification, and the IOG team has also sketched proof that the interpreter gets only those arguments that would not break the property.\nIn our second blog post, we ll take a closer look at the 2-phase validation process of Cardano transactions. So, keep an eye out later this week for part two.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

While full node wallets are a good option for more tech-savvy users, these wallets consume a significant amount of resources and take longer to sync because they hold a full copy of the blockchain. So a full-node wallet might not suit users requiring fast access to their assets. As Cardano reaches more mainstream audiences and developing markets an alternative is required.\nTo simplify the experience for wallet users, IOG is developing Lace a one-stop-shop for all blockchain operations. This new platform will be feature-packed, yet lightweight, streamlining online finance. Acting as a portal to Web3.0, Lace will encompass elements of true decentralization. This means that users will be able to interact with other users and organizations in a peer-to-peer way, exchanging data and assets without relying on third parties.\nBroader mainstream adoption requires a greater user experience. That's why IOG gathered user feedback early in the development process, and built Lace following requirements for speed, simplicity, and seamless flows.\nDesigned to cater to a variety of users interested in leveraging Cardano s infrastructure to optimize their wallet experience, Lace will allow everyone to become a part of the crypto space. The light wallet will provide unparalleled security and functionality. So, whether you re a crypto-savvy user, an enthusiast, an ada holder, or a newbie, Lace 1.0 will provide a friendly and intuitive experience to:\nsecurely store your funds\ntransact and make payments\nstore and view your non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\ndelegate stake\ninteract with different DApps.\nIn future iterations, Lace plans to support identity and voting on Cardano the key pillars to ensure secure personal data protection in a decentralized way.\nOver time, Lace also intends to utilize different Cardano products combining a range of features into a cohesive user experience. This will include integration with Atala PRISM for identity and personal data management, along with Project Catalyst for easy registration and voting. Other future enhancements may also include integration with EVM sidechains (allowing Ethereum developers to easily harness the robust and verifiably secure infrastructure of Cardano) and Hydra for scalable and cost-efficient transaction processing.\nWhile initially the light wallet is built for the Cardano blockchain, the long-term goal is to make it blockchain-agnostic.

    "prompt": "Interoperability is key to blockchain growth?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nOlga Hryniuk - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: April 13, 2022\nSummary:\nBridges, sidechains, and the AGIX ERC20 converter are providing solutions for Cardano cross-chain development\nArticle:\nCardano is steadily expanding a broad community of developers and blockchain enthusiasts. According to Cardano blockchain insights, there are over 4.5 million native tokens, over 5 thousand NFT projects, and more than 900 projects overall building on Cardano to date.\nTo support this growth, the community is now working on Cardano's wider adoption. The ability to work with other blockchains interoperability is key to this.\nIn this post, Input Output Global (IOG) takes a look at blockchain bridges, sidechains, and the role of the AGIX ERC20 converter. These are the core elements that enable communication between blockchains to ensure greater scalability, technology adoption, and ease of use.\nToday, there are thousands of blockchains Bitcoin, Ethereum, Algorand, Solana, and so on. They employ a range of programming languages and have their own systems and rules. Interoperability is the ability of different blockchain networks to connect in order to exchange and leverage data between one another and to move unique types of digital assets.\nThe value held in blockchains is increasing exponentially. However, to evolve the industry, each network cannot be limited to its own silo , functioning in its own ecosystem. As the volume of transactions increases, users tend to switch to other networks because each blockchain handles specific tasks that others may not address. The desire to switch networks can also relate to fees, speed of transaction processing, security, or incentives.\nInteroperability is essential for blockchain technologies to succeed users need to have the ability to transact with each other without being limited to a certain network. Developers should be able to write smart contracts that are compatible with many blockchains. And, of course, users should be able to transact with all types of tokens without limitations.\nSidechains and blockchain bridges are two technologies that enable interoperability by allowing users to interact with each other simultaneously across multiple blockchains.\nBack in 2017, during his Cardano whiteboard presentation, Charles Hoskinson said:\nThe idea of interoperability is that there won t be one single token to rule them all.\nBlockchain bridges enable a token native to one blockchain, to be used on a different blockchain. A bridge allows tokens to be moved from one blockchain to another, where they can be used for payments or to interact with decentralized applications (DApps).\nThere are three types of blockchain bridges:\nCentralized: these bridges are owned and fully controlled by a single party (ie. a company) that validates all bridge operations.\nPermissioned (federated): these bridges are more decentralized as they are operated by multiple parties. However, a person or entity willing to become a validator needs permission from the federation that maintains the bridge to set up and run a node that helps validate bridge operations.\nPermissionless (trustless): these bridges work like a fully decentralized system. Anyone can join this bridge to help maintain the validity of its operations.\nGenerally, bridge operators act as network validators. Operators accept the tokens that are undergoing migration and store them in a special smart contract. Then, using smart contracts, operators can issue the equivalent of those tokens on another network. Some bridges can only move tokens in one direction, others can make transfers in both directions. For example, unidirectional bridges can move tokens from Ethereum to Cardano for users to interact with DApps on Cardano. If a bridge is bidirectional, then users will be able to move tokens back from Cardano to Ethereum. The bridge mechanism depends on the type of smart contracts used within the networks.\nWhat is the AGIX ERC20 converter?\nThrough a collaborative effort, IOG and SingularityNET embarked on a mission to build a solution to drive greater adoption for Cardano creating a bridge for Ethereum developers to leverage the inherent benefits of the network, including a more predictable and cost-efficient way to host their applications.\nSingularityNET has recently launched the AGIX-ERC20 converter on mainnet. This bridge is centralized meaning that the validity of its operations and token transfer success will be managed exclusively by SingularityNET.\nWhile SingularityNET can now support the AGIX-ERC20 converter independently, IOG continues to explore the possibility of other solutions. This will bring a greater degree of choice to the Cardano ecosystem empowering developers to select tools that fit their specific needs. IOG s commercial team is also available for developers, DApps, and enterprises alike to inquire about potential collaborations regarding future converters or any other initiative and can be reached using the contact form.\nNow let s talk about sidechains. The main benefit of sidechains is their ability to introduce new features to the network without causing security risks to the mainnet. Sidechains expand blockchain s scalability because they take the burden of processing complex logic off the main chain, thereby increasing the speed (and decreasing the cost) of transaction processing. Sidechains can also act as a two-way mechanism for transferring tokens between the main and additional chains, which in turn greatly increases blockchain interoperability.\nSimply put, a sidechain is a separate blockchain that is connected to the mainnet. The mainnet acts as a parent blockchain, but since sidechains are separate ledgers, they are not affected by the overall traffic. Organizations can set up their own sidechains to process transactions, execute smart contracts, and move tokens faster. These operations are not only more efficient, but also much cheaper than on the main chain, which benefits everyone.\nSidechains can also inherit some (or all) features of the parent chain, such as the ledger model and consensus mechanism. However, they can also adopt a different model depending on the organization s goals. For example, a sidechain can combine different security protocols, consensus algorithms, or governance models to create a new sidechain that interoperates with other networks.\nCardano sidechains\nBy adding a sidechain to Cardano, it is possible to create opportunities for developers using the Solidity language on Ethereum. For instance, using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), developers can easily build DApps on top of Cardano.\nMilkomeda is a sidechain protocol that was launched recently to support Cardano. It allows EVM-compatible smart contracts to be executed on the Milkomeda C1 sidechain, which is connected to the Cardano main chain. Currently, Milkomeda does not use Cardano s security model, but this is being addressed to ensure the highest level of security. Milkomeda provides a broad selection of DApps by allowing developers to port over existing projects from Ethereum and also enables the latest innovations in zero-knowledge technology to be implemented as L3+ solutions on top of its protocol. Additionally, Milkomeda aims to provide interoperability between Cardano and other blockchains such as Solana by the end of 2022.\nEarlier this week, Wanchain announced new decentralized, non-custodial, bi-directional cross-chain bridges connecting Cardano to other layer 1 blockchains. Wanchain is both a sustainable layer 1 proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain and a decentralized interoperability solution. The Wanchain layer 1 PoS blockchain is a full Ethereum-like environment that works with industry-standard Ethereum tools, DApps, and protocols. Importantly, it shares some common ground with Cardano. Wanchain uses a PoS consensus algorithm called Galaxy Consensus that leverages a variety of cryptographic schemes including distributed secret sharing and threshold signatures to improve random number generation and block production mechanisms. Galaxy Consensus, developed by world-class researchers and academics, is a continuation of Cardano s own Ouroboros.\nDr. Ben Goertzel, SingularityNET s CEO, has also recently announced that his pioneering AI project is introducing the HyperCycle sidechain. It is being designed as a lightweight layer 2 architecture to enable inexpensive, high-speed, large-scale on-chain execution of microservices. This project is specifically designed to optimize AI-related processes, and will have profound implications for many domains beyond AI that require efficient and scalable sidechain solutions.\nOrbis and Fourier are additional scalability solutions being developed within the Cardano ecosystem. Orbis will act as a ZK (zero-knowledge) rollup layer 2 protocol, moving computation off-chain to scale Cardano's throughput. Meanwhile, Fourier Protocol is being designed as an interoperable, EVM-compatible solution on Cardano to accelerate the migration of EVM-based projects into the Cardano ecosystem and further boost the adoption of Plutus-based applications that lack an interoperable scaling solution.\nLast but not least, IOG is planning to release a new permissionless EVM sidechain this year. This sidechain will allow developers to write Solidity smart contracts on Cardano, create EVM compatible DApps, and ERC20-compatible tokens (and in time, their own sidechains) while gaining many of the benefits of Cardano. That means users will benefit from far lower fees and faster settlement times on a more environmentally sustainable blockchain. The key features of the EVM sidechain will be full compatibility with Ethereum upgrades and tools, Web3 wallet compatibility, the use of the proof-of-stake Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus protocol, and, of course, its ability to inherit security from the Cardano main chain.\nApril s Cardano360 show will feature updates from Milkomeda, Wanchain, Orbis and IOG s own EVM sidechain teams.

(Along with an introduction to AV, its even more performant sibling )\nArticle:\nThe recent enabling of smart contracts on Cardano has led to a significant increase in user activity. Simultaneously, average transaction sizes grew due to code-carrying script transactions. With the first decentralized-finance (DeFi) applications now deployed on the Cardano ecosystem, and more on the way, we expect this trend to continue. To keep up with this elevated demand, the system s current transaction throughput must be increased.\nAn obvious approach to increase transaction throughput is to increase the block-size limit to fit more transactions per block. Block size has already been increased by 25 this year from 64kB to its current 80kB, and we anticipate further increases. However, there is a limit on how large a block can be securely maintained by a ledger-consensus protocol if the block production rate is to be kept at the current level. To achieve high throughput without compromising the security of the system, additional measures are required. To understand why we need to take a closer look at how ledger consensus works in general:\nLedger consensus protocols are characterized by two-time parameters:\np, the maximal network delay for a new block to reach (e.g.) 95 of the network, and\nb, the (expected) time between the generation of two new blocks\nIn typical protocols, to argue consistency for consensus, the propagation of a prior block must finish before the next block is generated at least most of the time. Thus, b is chosen to be somewhat larger than p. In Cardano, we have p=5s (seconds) and b=20s.\nNow, how much data can be transported by a block under these conditions? To see this, we need to examine in more detail what exactly has to be achieved within p.\nFigure 1. Block network diffusion and validation within the p=5s budget\nConsider the above Figure 1 depicting in a simplified way, how block propagation works in the network. The block producer sends their new block header to Peer 1 (white h-box), occupying both nodes network links during the time span indicated by the white h-box. Peer 1 then validates the header (involving local computation during the time span indicated by the gray hv-box). If the header is valid, i.e. the header proves eligible block leadership, etc., the block body is downloaded by Peer 1 (white b-box), again occupying both nodes network links. Finally, Peer 1 validates the block body (gray bv-box), and, only if the block body is also valid, Peer 1 is ready to propagate the block to other peers along the lines of what was just described.\nAn unfortunate side effect of this mode of operation is that a single node s CPU and network link is only utilized during a small fraction of p=5s while remaining (mostly) idle during the rest of the (expected) b=20s.\nConcretely, the amount of data we can fit into a block is determined by the peer-to-peer network delay of the block and the required validation time. Both grow roughly linearly in the size of the block times the maximal number of hops required to reach 95 of all nodes. Measurements show that, to guarantee network propagation within p=5s, the block size should not exceed 2 MB. Accounting for computationally intense scripts, validation time may even impose a much lower limit.\nThe good news is that, within these constraints, transaction throughput can be exceeded by applying changes to the peer-to-peer network and/or consensus layers. We explain these techniques below.\nReconsidering Figure 1, we see that all nodes actions are performed in strict sequence, and thus p needs to fit the time required by a single node multiplied by the number of hops in the peer-to-peer path. We observe that, while this is necessary for network transmission, it is not for block validation.\nConsider Figure 2. By allowing blocks to be propagated before full validation has taken place, we can exclude (repeated) body validation from the propagation path. As soon as Peer 1 has received the block body (b-box), it can already start propagating the block concurrently to validating the block-body, etc.\nIn contrast to the scheme in Figure 1, the p budget now only needs to account for body validation once. This results in a higher time budget for peer-to-peer network transmission and/or body validation, thus allowing for a higher transaction throughput (for easy comparison to Figure 1, this gain is illustrated by a larger body-validation ( bv ) budget).\nFor reasons explained below, it is crucial that the following two validation checks remain fully replicated in the propagation path:\nHeader correctness, i.e. the block correctly references its predecessor, and correct block leadership (verifiable-random-function (VRF) and block-signature validation).\nBlock completeness, i.e. the received (but not yet validated) body is indeed referenced by the header s body hash.\nHow might diffusion pipelining (as described above) affect the security of the consensus and network layers?\nFirst, note that the consensus layer remains unaffected by this change:\nHonest blocks are always valid, since the block leader fully validates the chain to be appended by the new block as well as the new block itself, and,\nIncomplete blocks are not propagated (due to Point 2 above), and,\nInvalid (complete) blocks, though possibly propagated through the network, are always discarded by an honest node after body validation\nSecond, concerning Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the network layer, note that the adversary can try to congest the system by diffusing invalid blocks. However, correct block leadership is still verified (due to point 1), implying that such a block will only be propagated if the adversary is scheduled to do so, i.e., no more load is generated than if this block leader was honest (except for the block not contributing towards the throughput of the system). Furthermore, stake-pool operators (SPOs) generating invalid blocks can be easily identified and punished, in fact an infraction management system is currently in development to perform exactly this function.\nTo conclude, diffusion pipelining increases the budget for block propagation and validation times within the p limit, allowing for larger blocks and thus for increased transaction throughput while leaving the consensus rules unchanged. It promises to substantially increase throughput while being achievable by minimally invasive changes to the system, and is thus an excellent candidate for implementation in the short term. Still, the impact of pipelining (alone) is limited, and our ambitions do not stop here.\nWe next give a summary of a more powerful technique that can achieve even higher transaction throughput, but also requires some more dramatic protocol changes.\nThe idea behind diffusion pipelining delayed body validation can be taken to the extreme: a new block is still required to arrive within p, but we do not demand that its body validation be completed within p. We refer to this as asynchronous validation (AV).\nConsider Figure 3. Body validation is allowed to essentially consume the remaining (expected) b budget (besides block transmission and header validation), thus virtually putting the nodes CPUs at permanent load. However, note that the network link and the CPU are also assigned to other tasks (such as mempool synchronization), meaning that we do not want to utilize the full remainder of b for body validation, but leave a couple of seconds assigned to such other tasks.\nThis has a notable side effect. In contrast to diffusion pipelining, ledger validation generally lags behind the head of the chain. In particular, even honest block leaders now may possibly create blocks that are (partially) invalid, as they may not have finished validating the transaction history leading up to the new block.\nTo cope with this side effect, the ledger rules need to be adapted: to guarantee that honest blocks always contribute to the security of consensus, blocks carrying invalid transactions must still be considered as valid chain extensions. Invalid transactions can then simply be discarded during ledger validation.\nAlthough substantially improving over diffusion pipelining, AV can be even further improved. The reason is that, generally, not enough data can be diffused during p to produce enough validation work to max out the CPUs during the full remainder of the b period. To fully leverage the benefits of AV, we will combine it with the mechanism of input endorsers, which we will describe in an upcoming blog post.\nWhat impact on throughput can we expect from pipelining and AV? Finding the precise answer to this question is still ongoing work by our network and research teams, as giving a rigorous analysis in case of a malicious adversary (attempting to maximally disrupt the protocol) is rather involved. Still, to provide a first estimate, we give below a throughput analysis for the optimistic case where all SPOs behave honestly in expectation that the results for the malicious case will not deviate substantially (given also the presence of the infraction management system). Still, note that the real throughput of the system will likely vary from the given estimates.\nIn Table 1, we present these throughput estimates (in transactions per second, TPS). Recall that throughput depends both on transaction sizes and validation times. For a selection of size/validation-time pairs, we assume that all transactions have the same characteristics, and give the respective throughput numbers. We compare four different protocols:\nPraos: Cardano s currently deployed protocol (block size 80 kB)\nPraos Max: Praos with the maximal possible block size that can be safely maintained (under the above assumptions)\nDiffusion pipelining\nAV (with 20 of the b budget discounted, and reserved for different tasks)\nWe consider four different transaction types with varied size and required time for validation. A simple payment transaction is somewhere near the 0.5 kB / 0.5 ms category, while script transactions may fall into either one of the other types, which require both a larger size and more effort to validate. Note also the last column (2 kB / 32 ms) where validation time becomes substantial in comparison to the network delay: Increasing the block size (from Praos to Praos Max) does not help to improve throughput as validation already maxes out the time budget. Consequently, pipelining and AV provide strong relative gains exactly in these cases since they increase the validation-time budget.\nIncreasing the throughput of a permissionless blockchain is security critical, as admitting more load to the system may introduce DoS-attack opportunities. It is thus advisable to perform such changes in a sequence of small steps while carefully observing the effects on the system.\nThe first such steps were taken last December and this February by raising the block-size limit (and Plutus-script memory units) from 64kB to 80kB (see also this recent blog by John Woods).\nOver the months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor and adjust these parameters, based on network demand and capacity constraints. Further improvements will come with the implementation of diffusion pipelining. Other consensus optimizations, including input endorsers, are still under development, and more details on how these will be executed will be announced in due time.\nNote that the optimization endeavor of the Cardano Basho era extends beyond the network and consensus layers, and includes Plutus script enhancements as well as off-chain processing see this recent blog by Tim Harrison. In particular, Hydra, a layer-2 protocol suite under development, offers another pathway for a dramatic improvement in total transaction throughput by allowing to execute transactions off-chain.\nAcknowledgments.

    "prompt": "How were scaling Cardano in 2022?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nTim Harrison - VP Community & Ecosystem\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: January 14, 2022\nSummary:\nWith core smart contract capability now deployed, the next phase for Cardano focuses on performance optimization and scaling. And it starts right here\nArticle:\nThe Cardano project has always been committed to addressing the classic blockchain trilemma; scalability, security, and (importantly) decentralization. As the organization tasked with creating the core platform, we have always pursued a defined, clearly staged roadmap to deliver on Cardano s capability and fulfill its long-term potential.\nUtilizing formal development methods and Haskell code with deep roots in a peer-reviewed academic approach we have delivered a robust, secure platform fit for the future. Built for correctness. We named this phase Byron.\nAn incredible community has grown up around our endeavors and, through a network of some 3,000 stake pool operators, we now have one of the most decentralized proof-of-stake networks in the world. This era of decentralization and stake pools we named Shelley, after poet and political radical, Percy Bysshe Shelley.\nGoguen (which included the Alonzo HFC event) brought with it core smart contract capability, paving the way for DeFi and DApps. With initial Plutus capability now deployed, we continue to evolve the expressiveness of the Plutus language and the overall proposition, in collaboration with a growing community of developers.\nNow, as we enter the Basho stage, we re investing further energy into optimization and scaling. Building on these foundations, and steadily increasing capacity and throughput to deal with the growth in the DApp ecosystem and onboard first hundreds of thousands, then millions of new users. From DeFi degens to citizens of developing nations.\nDuring the course of this year, starting right now, we ll be pursuing this next phase of our mission. Parameter adjustments, improvements, enhancements, and other innovations will all play their part in steadily increasing Cardano s capacity & throughput during 2022. While maintaining the considered, safe approach that has served us to date. Yes, we anticipate periods of high demand, and network congestion at times. We re on an exciting journey and usage will be high. While we may at times feel impatient, this is the way. Here s how we will optimize and scale as we grow.\nThe bigger the block, the more transactions it can carry. Block size was recently increased by 8KB to 72KB (a 12.5 increase); further increases will be applied over time based on ongoing system monitoring and overall network health.\nImproves block propagation times by coalescing validation and propagation. The goal is for blocks to be propagated to at least 95 of peers within five seconds by reducing the dead time between blocks (the block propagation overhead). This provides the headroom to make more aggressive scaling changes, such as increasing block size/increasing Plutus parameter limits.\nInput endorsers improve block propagation times and throughput by allowing transactions to be separated into pre-constructed blocks. This improves the consistency of block propagation times and allows higher transaction rates.\nMemory usage is more efficient across the chain. Specifically, there are memory improvements in Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) handling, stake distribution, live stake distribution and pools, and hash representation.\nEven more effective usage of the powerful eUTxO model through smart contract optimization, including:\nReference inputs (CIP-0031) Plutus scripts can inspect transaction inputs without needing to spend them. This means that it is not necessary to create UTxOs simply to inspect the information held by an input.\nPlutus Datums (CIP-0032) Datums can be attached directly to outputs instead of datum hashes. This simplifies how datums are used, as a user can see the actual datum rather than having to supply the datum that matches the given hash.\nScript sharing (CIP-0033) Plutus script references can be associated with transaction outputs, meaning that they can be recorded on-chain for subsequent reuse. It will not be necessary to supply a copy of the script with each transaction, hugely reducing friction for developers. Reusing scripts in multiple transactions significantly reduces transaction sizes, improving throughput and reducing script execution costs.\nImprovements will help even the distribution of stake and reward computations across the epochs, thus providing greater headroom for block size increases. Also, memory usage is now more efficient. Memory compaction reduces RSS footprint, and memory sharing means we need fewer data instantiated. Node version 1.33.0, from January 2022, reduces peak load at critical points, including the epoch boundary.\nBy storing portions of the protocol state on disk, nodes will need to hold less in memory, meaning that RAM-constrained systems will be able to run nodes provided they have sufficient storage, and memory will no longer be a bottleneck on scalability. This will enable significant growth in the blockchain state.\nA sidechain is a separate blockchain connected to a main blockchain (the 'main' chain, also known as parent chain), through a two-way mechanism (the 'bridge') that enables tokens and other digital assets from one chain to be used in another and results returned to the original chain. Assets can be moved between chains as needed. One single parent chain can have multiple interoperable sidechains connected to it, which may operate in completely different ways. EVM sidechains coming to Cardano include dcSpark s Milkomeda and IOG s Mamba.\nIntroduces a family of layer 2 protocols including isomorphic state channels to maximize throughput, minimize latency, incur low to no costs, and greatly reduce storage requirements. Hydra provides a more efficient means to process transactions off-chain while using the main-chain ledger as the secure settlement layer.\nOffloading some of the computation, for example with Asynchronous Contract Execution (ACE) can drive greater core network efficiency. Transactions occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap transactions via a trust model.\nTo achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of participants. Mithril will improve chain synchronization while maintaining trust. The result? Multi-signature aggregation that is fast and efficient without compromising security features.\nInfographic credit: Mikki Pham/Fernando Sanchez\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "completion": "Original author:\nTemujin Louie - Director of Marketing, Wanchain\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: April 27th, 2022\nSummary:\nToday we re announcing new interoperability solutions between Cardano and EVM blockchains.\nArticle:\nAt Wanchain, we believe in the importance of decentralization and have a clear vision of a future where the global blockchain landscape behaves as a beautiful, singular, interoperable network. We re particularly excited to take another important step in this direction, and today we can share the news that we are enabling interoperability between the Cardano mainnet, Cardano sidechains, and other blockchain networks.\nThese efforts will see the deployment of decentralized, non-custodial, bi-directional cross-chain bridges connecting Cardano to other layer 1 blockchains. Wanchain bridge nodes will be upgraded to further secure Cardano s cross-chain bridges and transactions and Wanchain will become an EVM-compatible sidechain to Cardano.\nWanchain is both a sustainable layer 1 proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain and a decentralized interoperability solution. The Wanchain layer 1 PoS blockchain is a full Ethereum-like environment that works with industry standard Ethereum tools, DApps and protocols. Importantly, it shares some common ground with Cardano. Wanchain uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called Galaxy Consensus that leverages a variety of cryptographic schemes, including distributed secret sharing and threshold signatures to improve random number generation and block production mechanisms. Galaxy Consensus, developed by world-class researchers and academics, is a continuation of Cardano s own Ouroboros.\nMeanwhile, Wanchain bridges are decentralized, direct, non-custodial bridges that connect both EVM and non-EVM networks without requiring any relay chains or intermediary networks. These bridges use a combination of Secure Multiparty Computation (sMPC) and Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) to secure cross-chain assets. Currently, more than fifteen layer 1 and layer 2 networks (and counting!) are connected by Wanchain s network of blockchains.\nBy turning Wanchain into an EVM-compatible sidechain to Cardano, Cardano DApp developers and users will gain access to more coding languages, frameworks and integrated developer environments. Furthermore, not only does this novel approach maximize the security of Cardano s interoperability solution, it also doubles as a scalability solution. Transactions can now safely be moved off Cardano, recording only the vital information on the layer 1 blockchain to ensure security and immutability.\nThis sidechain approach heralds a new era for Cardano, as it begins to transition into a fully-fledged multi-chain ecosystem with greater security and scalability.\nHopefully this is just the beginning of a longer term collaboration between Wanchain and Input Output and we look forward to sharing more updates soon.\nLearn more about Wanchain and the project on April s Cardano360 show, where Wanchain s VP of Engineering Dr Weijia Zhang will be appearing as a special guest.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "DeFi Demystified?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nOlga Hryniuk - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOG.io: January 10, 2022\nSummary:\nWith the Cardano ecosystem set to grow exponentially in 2022, now is the time to get to grips with some of the prime principles and jargon behind DeFi\nArticle:\nThe number of ada users and software developers building on the Cardano blockchain continues to grow. With projects now in final testing and starting to deploy, sites like Cardano Cube, Built on Cardano, Building On Cardano, Essential Cardano, and Developers.cardano.org are busy mapping an exciting ecosystem. Cardano has been created as a secure, robust platform to build blockchain-based products, services, and systems. With a clear roadmap to steadily develop, we now see it scaling to serve on a global scale.\nDeFi decentralized finance has exploded in recent years, opening up a host of new financial instruments from the useful to the crazily speculative. Ultimately as this market matures, the goal of DeFi is to help individuals and companies engage in financial activity without going through a central, expensive middleman such as a bank, or to attain higher returns on their assets in an era of inflation and negative interest rates.\nCardano has expanded on this idea. The aim is to bring inexpensive banking and insurance services to the millions of people worldwide who cannot access such products. This would help break down the barriers between developed and developing nations. We call this vision RealFi .\nDespite this surge for Cardano, overall blockchain understanding and adoption levels are still low. Not least, because of the mountain of jargon, every crypto-curious person needs to grapple with. So, in anticipation of the next wave of fresh interest in Cardano and particularly to welcome new readers to this blog we thought the beginning could be a great place to start!\nSo we ll try to unpack the complexity of some notions that we so often read about with blockchain. Terms like DeFi, RealFi, DApp, DEX, liquidity, and so on go hand-in-hand with the latest blockchain products. Let s take a look at what these terms mean, and let s start with the basic building blocks.\nIt all starts with a blockchain. So, simply put, a blockchain is a digital book of records what accountants would call a ledger about transactions. What s unusual about this book is that it is not controlled by a single person, company, or government official. Instead, entries are made in a decentralized way. By decentralized, we mean that thousands of people s computers communicate with each other to agree on whether a transaction is valid. They reach this consensus based on the rules built into the blockchain software they are running. Blockchain records cannot be altered and can be examined by everyone making it impossible to delete the record about a transaction, forge its amount, or hide any details. This feature guarantees transparency and trust between the users. Interestingly, although the blockchain shows such information, users are presented as addresses. So, although anyone can see what transactions were made to and from an address since the blockchain started, no one can identify the person at the blockchain address.\nThe advantages of decentralized systems are summarized in Figure 1.\nBut how do we use blockchain in daily life, and why does it matter? The answer is that blockchain is about trading or exchanging funds under specified conditions, for a potentially infinite number of applications. Companies in healthcare, art, retail, collecting, beverage, sportswear, and gaming already use blockchain technology.\nFigure 1. Decentralized v traditional finance\nDecentralized finance or DeFi is a blockchain-based form of finance that addresses the same needs as traditional finance. You can send and receive payments, pay for products or services, or invest in cryptocurrency projects instead of bonds or stocks. However, DeFi does not depend on any intermediary and uses smart contracts to settle deals fairly. By adding an identity component such as Atala Prism and thus a bridge to the real world you have what we call RealFi.\nIn a traditional setting, we use money to pay for products and services. This medium of exchange is usually represented as coins or banknotes issued by central banks. Crypto users have popularized the use of the term fiat to describe real-world money. The US dollar, British pound, and Japanese yen are all fiat money. The word has been used since governments stopped having to back their currency with gold. Instead, they issue a formal decree a fiat that their currency is legal tender.\nOn the blockchain, people use crypto assets instead of fiat. Let s take a look at the different types (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Types of cryptocurrency assets\nBefore we dive into the peculiarities of DeFi terminology, let s first see what makes it all work. So, the driving force of security and fair agreements lies in smart contracts. Let s say you download a DeFi app and you d like to lend Alice 10 ada. We need to be assured that Alice will pay it back, and we d also like to earn some interest if she pays it back later than agreed. Traditionally, users sign agreements and specify such conditions. That s also done on the blockchain, but in the form of smart contracts.\nAn interesting fact is that smart contracts don t find specific data themselves. For example, we agree with Alice that she pays back by say, January 20. For a smart contract to execute, it needs to know the date, whether Alice processed a transaction and whether the sent amount matches the indicated amount. For this, smart contracts use oracles.\nWith Cardano, users can work with Plutus or Marlowe contracts:\nPlutus: a set of programming tools for writing smart contracts on Cardano. Deployed since September on Cardano, it includes Plutus Core the software that runs Plutus transactions and contracts and the Plutus programming language, which is based on Haskell, a language designed for writing extremely reliable programs. There is also the Plutus Playground a place where developers can test their code before using it on the main chain.\nMarlowe: Marlowe is a language designed specifically for writing financial smart contracts. It is limited to financial applications and is for experts in finance rather than in programming. There is also the Marlowe Playground, where users can create, edit, simulate, and analyze Marlowe contracts in a web browser. Marlowe will be deployed to Cardano later this year.\nUsers access various DeFi platforms and applications for different purposes. For instance, asset management products (or simply, wallets) store, send and receive cryptocurrencies between users. There are many decentralized applications (DApps):\nNow that the Cardano ecosystem is growing fast, more and more DeFi products are coming to Cardano. Users will soon be able to use new DApps and platforms for their financial needs. Thus, to ensure that users and the developer community can offer and consume products of the best quality, we are working on:\nThe dAppStore: a user-friendly marketplace for all Cardano DApps. It is also a place where users with limited blockchain knowledge will be able to explore ways that the technology can be useful to them.\nDApp certification: certification and assurance help ensure that products meet certain quality checks. While voluntary (Cardano is, after all, open and decentralized) Certification benefits both developers and users because it includes security checks that help with auditing smart contracts. There are three levels of certification, each of which is complementary to the others.\nDeFi platforms and DApps mainly deal with financial activities. Besides sending and receiving funds, these can be used for investing, lending, and borrowing.\nAs a matter of fact, users can borrow cryptocurrency on the blockchain without paying interest:\nLet s take a look at a few more of the most common terms you ll come across in DeFi:\nLiquidity is another term that you ll commonly hear. It measures the circulating supply and trading activity in a certain DEX, CEX, or another network. Circulating supply is essential to meet the trading needs of users. For example, Alice wants to sell some bitcoins she owns and instead buy some ada, and let s say, some tokens needed for her new shopping app. While bitcoin trading is very popular, she won t have any difficulties. She ll probably buy ada as well if the chosen exchange supports it. But what if there are none of the tokens she s looking for? Or, say, she wants to get 100 tokens for her app, and there are only 30? This is what liquidity is about having enough supply of coins or tokens to satisfy users requirements.\nLiquidity includes relevant activities and notions that go hand in hand with them:\nLiquidity mining: the process of creating or adding new coins or tokens to support the demand for transactions. Liquidity miners (providers) usually get rewards that incentivize them to support the user base and grow liquidity pools. Liquidity mining is also known as yield farming.\nLiquidity pools: a pool of deposited cryptocurrencies that provides liquidity to the network, where the currencies are in demand.\nAMM (automated market maker): a pool of cryptocurrencies that provides liquidity between trading pairs . A trading pair is a match between Alice, who wants to sell her bitcoin, and Bob, who wants to buy it, for example. AMMs are decentralized and depend on the liquidity provided by their users.\nDecentralized exchanges aren t only convenient marketplaces for cryptocurrency trading. They also serve as tools for earning profit. So let s discuss some relevant terms:\nROI (return on investment): the profit or loss on an investment, often expressed as a percentage.\nYield farming: as mentioned above, this is also known as liquidity mining. Because rewards are gained for providing funds, such a process is called farming.\nYield: rewards earned for cryptocurrency staking or liquidity mining.\nLeverage: the act of using borrowed capital, expecting profits to be greater than the paid interest.\nPlease note that we re not giving any financial advice. This post explains some of the DeFi terms for informative purposes only.\nAnd while we re discussing some earning profit terms, let s also recall how ada holders can securely benefit and get rewards from their ada:\nWhile these are exciting times, we continue to stress the importance of doing your own research and approaching new products with caution.

    "completion": "Original author:\nAnthony Quinn - Editor\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: September 26, 2021\nSummary:\nInnovative coin for the fast-growing ecosystem announced today at Cardano Summit 2021\nArticle:\nAt the Cardano Summit stage in Laramie, Wyoming, on Sunday, Charles Hoskinson and Shahaf Bar-Geffen announced that the COTI platform would be the official issuer of Djed, a new stablecoin for Cardano.\nDjed is based on an algorithmic design that uses smart contracts to ensure price stability. Smart contract programming is also used to ensure that the stablecoin will work effectively for decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions.\nDjed operates by maintaining a reserve of base coins, while minting and burning various other stable assets and reserve coins. It is designed to be used for paying transaction fees on the Cardano network. One benefit of this is to make transaction costs more predictable, so avoiding volatile and exorbitant gas fees for users.\nThe COTI development team believes that stablecoins are a 'killer app' that will be adopted by a large number of crypto users for settling payments and covering fees. The company was the first recipient of equity investment from the cFund for Cardano developments.\nShahaf Bar-Geffen, chief executive of COTI Group, said: 'The stablecoin ecosystem has matured tremendously over the past few years. Blockchain participants are using stablecoins to engage in everyday transactions because they allow monetary value to be exchanged in a seamless manner, regardless of the sender and recipient s location.\n'I believe that adding the Djed stablecoin to the Cardano blockchain will significantly improve how transactions are settled on the platform.'\nIO Global chief executive Charles Hoskinson said: 'The Djed stablecoin could be a game-changer in the crypto space, appealing to an entirely new audience at a time when the industry is already experiencing astronomical growth. Djed shares our commitment to formal verification, proving a robust method of combating price volatility of crypto markets.\n'COTI has been a long-time partner of the Cardano ecosystem. It s great to have them on board with this new venture.'\nCheck out the Djed website.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Combinator makes easy work of Shelley hard fork?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nAnthony Quinn - Editor\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: May 7, 2020\nSummary:\nA behind-the-scenes look with Duncan Coutts and Edsko de Vries\nArticle:\nSince the launch of the Incentivized Testnet marked the coming of the Shelley era last year, the Cardano platform has entered a fast-moving period of development. The Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol has supported Cardano Byron and the ada cryptocurrency for the past 30 months, and we ll soon be switching to Ouroboros Praos. This is the version of our proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol that will initially power Shelley as Cardano decentralizes. It builds in the staking process with monetary rewards for ada holders and stake pool owners.\nWe upgraded Cardano on February 20 with a hard fork that switched the mainnet from the original consensus protocol, Ouroboros Classic, to an updated version, Ouroboros BFT. This BFT hard fork began a transition period under Ouroboros BFT, a slimmed-down version of the protocol designed to help us make the switch to Praos, while still preventing any malicious behavior. Many probably didn t even notice. For Daedalus wallet users, it meant a standard software update. Exchanges had to upgrade manually, but they had several weeks to do this and we were on hand to help.\nThe next event was the Byron reboot on March 30. This released totally new code for many of the Cardano components, including a new node to support delegation and decentralization, and future Shelley features. A big advantage of the new code base is that it has been redesigned to be modular, so many components can be changed without affecting the others.\nIn turn, the BFT will act as the jumping-off point for the Shelley hard fork, which will happen once we re happy with the Haskell testnet. This second hard fork will be a similar process to the February one for exchanges, ada holders, and wallet users, and, hopefully, just as much of a non-event.\nHowever, while everything looks smooth on the surface, there is a lot of hidden activity going on. Like a duck serenely swimming across a pond while its feet are furiously paddling below the calm waters our blockchain engineers are hard at it.\nSo, we sat down with two of the leading engineers on the Cardano project, Duncan Coutts and Edsko de Vries, to find out how they ve done it. Duncan has been Cardano s architectural lead for the past three years, and between them, Duncan and Edsko have spent 35 years using Haskell, the programming language being used to develop Cardano.\nAs described in the Cardano roadmap, IOHK s blockchain engineers believe in smooth code updates. Instead of trying to do the jump from Ouroboros Classic to Praos in a single update which would be an incredibly complex task it s been a two-stage approach using Ouroboros BFT as an intermediary (Figure 1). The BFT code is compatible with both the Byron-era federated nodes and the Shelley-style nodes released in the Byron reboot. It's like a relay race: one runner (in our case, running one protocol) enters the handover box where the other runner is waiting; they synchronize their speeds (so they're perfectly compatible with each other) and then hand over the baton (operating the mainnet), and then the new runner with the baton continues from the handover box for the next lap.\nFigure 1. Mainnet Byron to Shelley roadmap\nThe Daedalus Flight process has helped us quickly develop and test a new wallet and, once everyone is running that on the mainnet, and once we finish swapping over the core nodes, the old code is redundant. We are in that transition phase right now, with a new mainnet Daedalus wallet released on April 24.\nOur aim is to have a graceful entry into Shelley , as IOHK chief Charles Hoskinson describes in his whiteboard video about the hard fork. A vital tool in making this move has been creating a hard fork combinator.\nA combinator is just a technical term for something that combines other things. For example, addition is a combinator of numbers. A hard fork combinator combines two protocols into a single protocol. We call this a sequential combination of the two protocols because it runs the first protocol for a while and at some point, it switches over to the second. In our case, these are two versions of Ouroboros as we move from BTF to Praos.\nThe clever part of all this has been the use of discrete modules that do their job while knowing as little as possible about each other and the blockchain. Simplicity is the key here and this process of taking out the details we call abstraction . Most of the consensus modules don t even have to know that they re dealing with a cryptocurrency and could be putting pretty much anything on a blockchain. For example, we ve done seminars using the example of a Pok mon ledger on an Ouroboros blockchain. The only thing that s different is the ledger rules; the consensus is all the same. You just set it up instantiate it in the programming jargon with the rules for playing Pok mon rather than for UTxO-style accounting.[For readers with a technical interest, watch out for Edsko delving further into the abstraction process and combinators in a future blog post.]\nIn fact, it s tricky because Cardano is running the ada cryptocurrency, and a pile of other things, at the same time. Think of it as changing all the wheels on a car while you re driving along and towing a caravan. So we have to be sure we can do this in a totally reliable way.\nWe could have tackled this as a one-off task, but it made sense to do it in a generic way using a protocol combinator. We chose this route because we get a better result and the testing that is vital to ensuring the code works is made far easier. On top of that, there will be more hard forks to come, which made the choice even clearer. For example, as we near the culmination of Cardano s development and move through the Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire eras, there will be at least one hard fork at each stage.\nWell, first off, we had to do it without research to turn to. The researchers describe a single protocol as a free-standing, perfect thing. But that s not where we are. We are trying to run Praos after having started with a chain that was using something else. What Edsko s working on, going from one protocol to another in a generic way, is just not covered in the research. And it s hard, it s complicated. All the details need a lot of thinking, a lot of scratching your head. But switching between Cardano codebases is not the sort of thing the academics can expect to get published. It doesn t have a novel aspect and is seen as just an implementation issue.\nAs Duncan says, for the researchers, these implementation issues are trivial but dealing with them is 99 of what we do. Take the problem of time for a blockchain. It s what I ve been banging my head against for a couple of weeks. Time is divided into slots where the chain can contain at most one block per slot. We often need to convert between slot numbers and time in the real world, for example when a node needs to know Is it my turn? to generate the next block. This is fundamental to Cardano, but the length of a slot changes after the hard fork. For Byron, a slot is 20 seconds; for Shelley, it will be two seconds, or perhaps one. To really complicate things, the exact point of time when the hard fork is made is decided on the chain itself. Yet, I need to know when the changeover point is. It s a quandary: to do slot conversions I need to know the state of the blockchain, but to know the state I need to know the slot conversions!\nThis is real chicken-and-egg territory with many complex things to disentangle. We have to be very precise with how we do things. It might be trivial in theory, but it s very difficult to disentangle things and make sure it s not a circular problem.\nDuncan: That s an excellent question. My reply is that you come to the answer on two levels. The first is intellectual: you analyze the problem, you do the maths, you talk to colleagues and wrestle with it until you can see how it all fits together. Second, we do all our QuickCheck testing to give us the confidence that this does what we think it does. We do extensive testing that really takes us into the unusual cases that you might never think of, including this changeover. We can do 100,000 tests every time we change a line of code. [Lars Br njes has written about how John Hughes, one of the creators of Haskell, has helped IOHK develop its testing strategies.]\nEdsko: Yes, I agree with those two points. In terms of the combinator, I resolve these things by thinking about the guarantees that the code I write needs to provide, and which guarantees that it, in turn, needs from the ledger. I sketch a mathematical proof that this if-then reasoning is indeed justified, and then turn to the formal method teams. The formal methods team are the people who set up the mathematical rules that describe the blockchain, and they can then tweak the rules in such a way that they provide the required guarantees.\nIn terms of Duncan s second point, I know the time issue I mentioned above is correct by thinking hard mathematically, and by testing. Timing decisions are easy when we have the full blockchain but are hard when we have to make predictions about the future. Fortunately, the way we set things up means I can easily create testing blockchains. So, I can create a full blockchain, then slice this chain in half. I take the first half and consider that to be in the pres, and set the other half in the future. Then I can use the present (first half) to make predictions about the future (the second half) and verify them against the whole thing (on which the calculations are easy). If they match, then I know everything is OK.\nRight after Duncan came up with the genius idea of the OBFT. So I ve been thinking about the combinator on and off for about 18 months. It was a design goal from the very beginning of our modular rewrite of Ouroboros starting in October 2018, with my first commit to the GitHub repository. We had a prototype demonstration with OBFT and Praos soon after, in December 2018.\nDuncan: Many people have been working on the consensus code, but whenever we have anything really hard, like this combinator, we give it to Edsko: he s our software engineer extraordinaire! This is Haskell programming as free climbing, rather than climbing with the ropes of formal methods for support.\nDuncan: The code that was running is right now being phased out and pretty soon the code that was running Cardano a month ago will no longer exist. Once everyone is running the new code on the mainnet and once we finish swapping over the core nodes, the old code is redundant. We are in that transition phase right now and no one is shouting that the sky is falling. No one has noticed it.\nEdsko: That is quite an achievement in its own right. The idea of OBFT was crucial in making the transition, but it s not relevant anymore once we make that transition to Shelley. This has been a way for us genuinely to ditch legacy code, which is often very difficult to do, as the banks know to their cost.\nDuncan: And if it all works fine, you won t notice anything.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Cardano marks its launch with Tokyo event?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nJane Wild\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: October 16, 2017\nSummary:\nHundreds of fans celebrate bright future for the cryptocurrency\nArticle:\nThe technology was conceived in an Osaka restaurant more than two years ago and from that small beginning Cardano has been built into a leading cryptocurrency. The project has amassed a team of experts in countries around the world, has generated more than 67,000 lines of code, and has a strong and growing community in countries across Asia and beyond. Along the way, Cardano has set new standards for cryptocurrencies with best practices such as peer review and high assurance methods of software engineering. The official launch was held in the district of Shibuya in Tokyo on Saturday October 14 for an audience of about 500 people, who had each won a ticket through a lottery held on social media. Excited cryptocurrency enthusiasts, Ada holders and business people from across Japan queued to get Cardano t-shirts and souvenir physical Ada coins, before going into the main hall to hear about how Cardano was created and the vision for its future. \"The first thing we did when we knew the project was real was to build great partnerships,\" Charles Hoskinson, founder and CEO of IOHK, told the audience. \"Our chief scientist is based at University of Edinburgh, it is a wonderful place, where they built the heart of Cardano. We have a lot of wonderful people at the University of Athens, they are rigorous, making sure that the theory works. And we have people at Tokyo Tech who work on multi party computation and look to the future, and work out how to make Cardano last a long time.\" The vision for Cardano, Hoskinson said, was that it would pull together academic research and bright ideas from computer science to produce a cryptocurrency capable of much more than its predecessors.\nThis \"third generation\" cryptocurrency would be able to scale to a billion users, using a proof of stake algorithm, Ouroboros, which avoided the huge energy consumption of proof of work cryptocurrencies. Features that would be added to Cardano to help it scale included sidechains, trusted hardware, and RINA, or recursive internetwork architecture. Sustainability would be part of the design by way of a treasury system to fund development indefinitely, allowing stakeholders to vote on proposed changes to the protocol. Meanwhile, the computation layer of the technology, would be innovative in using a tool called K Framework to allow developers to write smart contracts in the programming language of their choice, he said. Security is paramount to cryptocurrency because flaws in code increase the risk of hacks and the loss of coin holder funds, unfortunately witnessed too often. With that in mind, Duncan Coutts, head of engineering at IOHK, explained how the company approaches software development: cryptography research papers are translated into code using the technique of formal specification. This involves a series of mathematical steps that progressively take the cryptography closer to the code that the developers write, a process that allows checks to be made that the specifications are indeed correct.\nDuncan Coutts, IOHK Director of Engineering, presenting at the Cardano launch event\n\"I m passionate about bringing clever ideas from computer science and using them in Cardano,\" Coutts said. \"And I m obsessive about software quality. Beautiful software is like beautiful mathematics or poetry.\" Aside from engineering, the other twin pillar of IOHK is research, and Bernardo David went on stage to talk about the rigour supporting the papers that IOHK produces. David is an assistant professor at Tokyo Tech where IOHK has a research partnership, and was one of the team that produced Ouroboros, a provably secure proof of stake algorithm. On the question of whether people should accept the quality of the research, he pointed to the paper s peer review through its acceptance to Crypto 2017, the annual cryptography conference held in California. \"This is the first proof of stake paper that was published in a big conference so you can trust the largest and most respected cryptography conference in the world,\" he said. \"You don t have to take my word, you can trust all the other cryptographers.\"\nMichael Parsons, Chairman of Cardano, speaking at the Cardano launch event\nThe launch event introduced the other important organisations supporting Cardano, such as the Cardano Foundation. The Swiss-based standards body acts as the guardian of the protocol and its duties include providing information to the community and working with governments to shape regulation. Michael Parsons, chairman, announced that Ada holders would be able to store their coins in the Ledger hardware wallet and integration was being worked on. Plans for the future included working with a respected London think-tank to produce blockchain research. Thanking the community, he said: \"Cardano is a blockchain protocol with integrity. We are dedicated to helping it derive its full potential and make the world a better place. You supported us to help make Cardano what it is, so thank you.\" The third organisation supporting Cardano is Emurgo, which is based in Japan and extends support and advice to anyone wishing to build applications on the software.\nCardano fan Naomi Nisiguchi\nKen Kodama, CEO of Emurgo, emphasised the advantages of Cardano s technology over older cryptocurrencies, and said: \"Emurgo sees a bright future that Cardano will provide a more trustable way of identifying individuals and also a reasonable, and faster payment method to people who don't have them now. Emurgo will play an important role in plugging developers and startups to the Cardano ecosystem.\" Kodama, along with Darren Camas, senior adviser to Emurgo, spoke about how a network was being established in other Asian countries to support its growth. Camas said: \"The question for us is how do we help Ada become the fuel that powers financial technology, not only in the developed world but in Malaysia, Vietnam, Argentina, Nigeria How do we bring more people from across the globe to transact in the Cardano ecosystem?\"\nAfter the presentation crowds formed outside the hall to have their photos taken with the Cardano team. Some people who came along were longstanding supporters of the project, such as Naomi Nisiguchi, from Mie Prefecture. She works as a manager in the construction industry and has had an interest in cryptocurrency for four years. \"Around two years ago I heard about Ada and that Charles Hoskinson was involved,\" she said. \"I ve been following the news on Facebook and I m very interested to learn how the project will move on.\"\nKen Kodama, CEO of Emurgo, speaking at the Cardano launch event\nMany people had plans regarding Cardano. Takashi Kawaguchi set up Fintech Academia last month to give Japanese people information about cryptocurrencies, and came along because he believes Cardano has the potential to rise up and be on par with Bitcoin and Ethereum. His website would provide educational resources that would help people understand and trust crypto, he said, and learn that it wasn t an enemy, but represented the future.\nOther people at the event were planning business interests, such as Nobuyoshi Hayashi from Tochigi prefecture, who owns a consultancy and wants to begin offering cryptocurrency advisory services. The launch itself is only the beginning for Cardano, with many new features to be added during the next three years that will cement its position as the leading cryptocurrency. Mario Larangeira, specially appointed associate professor at Tokyo Tech, was in the audience, and said it was a great time to be working in cryptography. \"To be part of this project is challenging, complex but also very exciting,\" he said. \"Now we are working on multi party computation and putting even more cryptography into Cardano, for example with Kaleidoscope, new research that is being produced at Tokyo Tech with Bernardo David and Rafael Dowsley.\"\nBernardo David, IOHK Research Fellow, speaking at the Cardano launch event\nThere was much hard work ahead, agreed Charles Hoskinson, and holding an event in Tokyo with Cardano partners was a very special occasion. \"This is a really fun event,\" he said. \"Cardano has its largest community here in Japan and we felt it was so important to have a launch event to thank the community for being so supportive, loyal and patient. The point of this event has been to talk about where we came from and where we plan on going, and meet some new people and make new friends.\"\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Bringing ERC20 to Cardano?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nFrancisco Landino - Project Manager\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: May 17, 2021\nSummary:\nOur new ERC20 converter will allow Ethereum tokens like AGI to run on our proof-of-stake blockchain coming soon to testnet\nArticle:\nConnecting blockchain protocols and collaborating on applications are essential to achieving the promise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and provide an alternative to the traditional banking system.\nAccording to DeFi Pulse, a tracking website, cryptocurrency to a total value of over $75 billion is now locked up in DeFi. A year ago, the total was just $700 million. Most of this value is in the form of crypto-assets based on the ERC20 token standard.\nBut Ethereum s proof-of-work infrastructure is challenged with ever-rising costs. We foresaw this issue and providing an alternative was one of the founding principles we set for Cardano. This is about to come into fruition.\nTo expand the variety of use cases for application developers and businesses, Cardano will support the ERC20 token migration to its platform. The Alonzo hard fork and Plutus smart contracts are on the way. Once deployed, users of supported Ethereum tokens will be able to bring them over from Ethereum's congested network and take advantage of Cardano's transaction capacity and lower fees, while enjoying enhanced security, reduced cost, and interoperability.\nLet s take a closer look at the nature of ERC20 to understand why this standard fits the market trends in terms of business needs. First, of course, Ethereum brought the concept of smart contracts and programmable money to the blockchain in 2015. Since then, tokenization and the ERC20 token have gained popularity because of utility in everyday business transactions. Applications built on a blockchain can provide tokens that can serve as:\na payment unit\na transaction unit\naccess to digital services\na reward or incentive\na right to vote\nan investment mechanism\nWell-designed ERC20 tokens address many needs, and the more useful they become, the more demand grows and so their value grows accordingly. That is why these tokens are widely used and are so well supported by wallets and exchanges.\nThe ERC20 standard was invented for Ethereum, and as of today, there are over 400,000 contracts based on this token standard with examples including Binance coin (BNB), Tether (USDT), Uniswap (UNI), and Dai (DAI) to name a few.\nEthereum is a popular and functional blockchain platform, but it is slowing down and becoming more expensive. As more network participants interact with decentralized applications, the gas fees paid for validating transactions are rising sharply (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Ethereum gas fees are increasing\nThe problems being experienced by Ethereum users have also been identified by a Cointelegraph survey cited in DeFi Adoption 2020 :\n45 of platforms built on Ethereum name scalability and high gas costs among the top three problems constraining mass DeFi adoption.\nEthereum has not yet resolved these challenges and is unlikely to do so in the short term. So many businesses will want to consider other options.\nBy enabling the migration of ERC20 tokens to Cardano, we focus on delivering a value proposition that leverages Cardano s advantages over Ethereum. In particular, Cardano's higher capacity for transaction processing and lower fees when compared with Ethereum's high cost and often congested traffic.\nThe key to addressing the problem of network congestion and high fees is Cardano s Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Compared with Ethereum s proof-of-work protocol, Ouroboros needs far less energy to process network transactions; it runs using amounts of electricity on the scale of a large house, rather than a small country. Because of this, Ouroboros is not only eco-friendly but also needs far lower fees to process transactions.\nAdditionally, Cardano does not require smart contract execution costs as the ledger supports native token functionality with its built-in accounting model. This means that the tracking, transfer, and ownership of different types of assets are handled by the ledger instead of smart contracts. Whereas the creation and transfer of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum require the manual modification of the standard contract type, the logic for this is built into Cardano, which also eliminates the risk of errors and vulnerabilities.\nCardano currently supports ada and native tokens, which have proven successful with over 160,000 tokens minted. We are now launching an ERC20 converter to ensure better interoperability in the future as well as lay a solid background for extended business opportunities.\nOur ERC20 converter is a tool that will allow issuing organizations and their users to handle ERC20 token migration to Cardano. It is designed for token issuers (organizations that wish to enable the migration of their tokens to Cardano), and their users (token holders) to use the tool to move their ERC20 tokens to the Cardano network.\nUsers can convert their Ethereum tokens in just a few clicks, and when moved across, these tokens will be translated into a special native token on Cardano that has the same value and works just like an ERC20. Additionally, if the user wishes to do so at a later stage, they can move their tokens back to the source network by burning them on Cardano. Two-way convertibility is baked in.\nWe ll soon spin up a version of the ERC20 converter tool on a dedicated testnet. IO Global is currently working with partners for migration to Cardano, and SingularityNET will be the first of these. The ERC20 converter will introduce a new SingularityNET AGIX token, the deployment of which marks the first milestone in the SingularityNET to Cardano migration plan. The initial testnet will allow users to assess the process of migration while working with AGIX tokens both in Cardano and Ethereum Kovan testnets.\nIt will be possible to authenticate an account using Metamask (an extension for the Chrome browser) with more options to come later. Users will also need to add their Daedalus testnet address so they can migrate their tokens to Cardano and easily track balances and transactions.\nWhen users log into their ERC20 converter account, they will see SingularityNET tokens listed and available for migration, and, by clicking on a token details such as token balance. They will just need to select the token, indicate the amount they would like to convert, and then migrate them by specifying a Cardano address. When tokens migrate to the address, it will be possible to use them for payments and transactions from the Daedalus wallet. All the activities will be visible both within Etherscan and the Cardano Explorer.\nFigure 2. ERC20 converter dashboard\nAt later stages, users will see different types of tokens within the dashboard. Tokens available for migration will be listed first, and if not yet eligible it will be possible to subscribe for updates about any changes.\nAs the number of ERC20 converter partnerships increases, the range of token types supported will grow. Currently, our partners need to be custodians of their tokens, however, we will achieve greater interoperability while onboarding organizations when Plutus smart contracts operate on mainnet.\nOur goal is to support many tokens to create possibilities for business deals. So, further down the road, with a variety of tokens, the ERC20 converter will act as a bridge between blockchains, and this will promote effective cross-chain communication.\nThe ERC20 converter testnet is now in the final stages of quality assurance testing before the public launch. This stage will allow us to test the user journey and improve their experience along with fixing any occurring issues. We will also soon provide the dedicated testnet environment with relevant documentation and instructions on how users can test the converter capabilities.\nWe ll share an update on May s Cardano360 show. Meanwhile, stay tuned and follow our Twitter announcements to find out more in due course!\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Boosting Cardanos throughput with script referencing?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nOlga Hryniuk - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: April 13, 2022\nSummary:\nWe take a closer look at just some of the enhancements coming to Cardano in June\nArticle:\nDuring the Basho development phase, the ledger continues to optimize and scale for the growing demand. Along with parameter adjustments and node upgrades, Plutus capability continues to develop at a steady pace.\nPlutus is a living, evolving smart contract language. Cardano improvement proposals also known as CIPs play an important role in this evolution. Through the CIP mechanism, anyone can suggest an improvement to Cardano. CIPs encourage community engagement and proposal reviews, which are continually maintained on the Cardano Foundation s GitHub repository.\nLet s drill down into two of these. CIPs for reference inputs (CIP-31) and reference scripts (CIP-33) have been submitted to be implemented on Cardano and are among those due to be implemented as part of June s Vasil hard fork. Along with other scalability improvements, these enhancements to Plutus will boost throughput for decentralized apps (DApps) decentralized finance (DeFi), RealFi, products, smart contracts, and exchanges building or operating on Cardano.\nIn this post, we take a closer look at what these CIPs are and how they benefit and optimize Cardano's scalability.\nTransaction outputs carry datums, which enable the storage and access to information on the blockchain. However, these datums are constrained in a number of ways. For example, to access datum s information, you d have to spend the output that the datum is attached to. This requires the re-creation of a spent output. Any user who wishes to look at the data cannot spend the old output (which is gone), but must spend the new output (which they will not know about until the next block). In practice, this limits some applications to one operation per block, thus decreasing the desired performance.\nCIP-31 introduces a new mechanism for accessing information in datums a reference input. Reference inputs allow looking at an output without spending it. This will facilitate access to information stored on the blockchain without the need for spending and re-creating unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\nReference inputs also enable the other key improvement reference scripts.\nWhen you spend an output locked with a Plutus script, you must include the script in the spending transaction. Hence, the size of the scripts contributes to transaction size, which directly influences Cardano s throughput.\nLarge script sizes pose problems for users because:\nLarger transactions result in higher fees.\nTransactions have size limits. Large scripts can hit the limits. Even if one script fits, multiple scripts in one transaction might not fit. This makes it difficult to execute complex transactions that rely on several scripts.\nCIP-33 suggests script referencing as a possible solution. This is the ability to reference a script without including it in each transaction, which hugely reduces the contribution of scripts to the transaction size. Referencing scripts in multiple transactions can significantly reduce transaction sizes, improve throughput, and reduce script execution costs.\nHow does script referencing work?\nThe idea is to use reference inputs and outputs that carry actual scripts (reference scripts). The script referencing proposal eliminates sending frequently-used scripts to the chain every time they are used. Instead, scripts will be available in a persistent way on-chain. This means that the transaction using the script will not need to include the script itself, as long as it references the output that contains it.\nThis approach follows the reference inputs proposal (CIP-31). CIP-31 considers how to enable data sharing on-chain, and concludes that referencing UTXOs is the most appropriate solution. UTXOs store data safely, and take advantage of the existing mechanisms for size control.\nFor reference scripts, transaction outputs must be extended to carry an optional field to include a script. The minimum UTXO value for such outputs will depend on the size of the script, following the coinsPerUTxOWord protocol parameter.\ncoinsPerUTxOWord\nWith the proposals already submitted and implemented, Plutus script referencing and reference inputs are planned to be included in the June Vasil hard fork. The CIP process enables the community to contribute to the development of Cardano by proposing, discussing, reviewing, and contributing to improvement proposals. We encourage the developer community to join CIP discussions and visit Cardano Foundation s CIP repository for more details.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Atala SCAN Blockchainbased product authentication?",
    "completion": "Author:\nNeil Burgess\nSummary:\nHow a smart microchip can work with an advanced blockchain to defeat product counterfeiters\nYou ve paid a premium price for that collectible bottle of premium spirits, but there s that nagging doubt. Do you trust the retailer and all the actors in the supply chain to act with complete integrity?\nYou buy an expensive drug from an online pharmacy. Are you sure you are getting what you paid for? Atala SCAN IOG s product authentication system can answer your questions without the need to trust the retailer or anyone in the supply chain.\nPart of the solution for bottles of spirits is a smart seal that knows if it has been tampered with. Atala adds to this an encrypted, auditable link between the seal and the full manufacturing history of the specific bottle to which the seal is attached. You can check the history using a free app on your phone that can instantly verify a product s authenticity.\nAtala SCAN is built on the third-generation blockchain technology of Cardano. Blockchain software combined with touch-chip technology offers real advantages over traditional security methods like cap seals, holograms, and fancy packaging the history of a product can be checked instantly by the customer.\nThe need for improved security on products such as premium spirits, cosmetics, fashion goods, and prescription medication is being driven by the battle against ever-more sophisticated counterfeiters. The United Nations agency that is coordinating the fight against transnational organized crime groups describes the problem: The production and sale of counterfeit goods is a global, multi-billion dollar problem and one that has serious economic and health ramifications for governments, businesses and consumers.\nThe size of the international counterfeit market doubled from US$200bn in 2008 to US$509bn in 2019 equivalent to 2.5 of world trade, according to the US Patent and Trademark Office. Counterfeiting at such a scale costs jobs in manufacturing, endangers the lives of food and pharmacy customers, and deprives innovators of due rewards for their efforts.\nIOG s solution to counterfeiting crime is an integrated system comprising a smart seal based on a chip with wings that can be linked at the touch of a smartphone to the production records of the item. The records are held in secure storage that cannot be changed. Purchasers can check the provenance quickly, easily, and at no charge.\nThe smart seal is at the heart of the system. It is a wafer-thin label incorporating a near-field communication (NFC) chip. It is small enough to be glued to a product, incorporated in a card, or embedded in a product or its packaging. For example, it can be part of a special bottle cap or stitched into a handbag. You may have seen the NFC logo on a bank card. The technology allows devices to exchange information simply by touching or placing them next to one another. Like the microchips used for pet dogs, the smart seal consumes no power and silently waits for a signal from a reader. The signal induces an electric current in the chip s antenna, and that is enough power for the chip to transmit its stored data.\nModern smartphones incorporate a bi-directional NFC device as a standard feature so that a phone can operate both as a reader and a tag. The Nexus S was the first Android device to include it. That was in 2010. Apple added NFC to the iPhone in 2014 it has been built into every iPhone since the 6.\nMost tamper-evident NFC tags are designed to stop working if disturbed. All NFC tags need an antenna to work, and if the antenna is fragile enough, any tampering will stop the tag from working. The NTAG product used in Atala SCAN applications takes this one step further. The chip in the tag has two antennas, only one of which is designed to break. If the tag is disturbed, it continues to work but transmits a modified signal as evidence of the tampering.\nAtala SCAN is implemented at the first point in the supply chain that delivers the finished product to the brand owner. The brand owner s records can include product images and a full history, including tracing each component back to its point of origin. The brand owner decides what information is disclosed to the end customer through the embedded smart chip. It might be basic tracking data or part of a global consumer marketing campaign. This information is linked to the unique identifier of each tag. Atala SCAN engineers can help with setting up this linkage. The tag is then attached to, or associated in some way with, each product item.\nCardano is a blockchain platform for changemakers, innovators, and visionaries. It uses the Ouroboros proof of stake protocol to achieve consensus so that it is provably secure while consuming only a fraction of the resources required by older blockchains. With Atala, every item is associated with a unique entry on Cardano. That entry cannot be altered, but can be read easily, and can be used as part of an auditing system. Each entry comprises the cryptographic hash of the tag s identifier and links to the product metadata. The metadata, including images, is stored off-chain.\nJuan Ignacio Sierra, the Atala SCAN project manager, says: Working with blockchain ensures the immutability of the product information, but if there s no mechanism in place to securely link the information to the product itself, fake products can take advantage of the same blockchain information as the originals do. In Atala SCAN we use high security cryptographic hardware in the seal to ensure the security of the link between the blockchain information and the physical product.\nIf you have a smartphone, you will be able to download the free Atala SCAN app from the relevant online store. This application uses a phone s NFC reader to read the chip and look up the product information on Cardano. Simply touch the phone to the product, and know at once if the product is genuine and learn about its history.\nIOG is talking to several companies about launching the system.\nAtala SCAN has been in gestation for some time and it s exciting now that we can start to bring the proposition to market , says Juan Sierra. We re in discussions with a number of potential clients. We will have more to share soon!\nIf you are interested in product authentication for any reason, please get in touch with IOG through the Atala SCAN website, and we will be delighted to answer your questions.\nThanks to Anthony Quinn and Rachel Epstein for their indispensable contributions to this post.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "A closer look at the cFund?",
    "completion": "Original author:\nFernando Sanchez - Technical Writer\nOriginally published on IOHK.io: July 28, 2021\nSummary:\nFirst announced at last year s Shelley summit, the cFund is an early-stage investment fund focused on innovative companies primarily utilizing the Cardano blockchain and its technology.\nArticle:\nAs we move closer to smart contracts on Cardano, fund activity is now accelerating. We spoke with David Roebuck, Principal at Wave Financial, to find out more about the fund and its goals.\nThe cFund is a crypto-native hedge fund managed by Wave Financial in partnership with IOG. The fund employs an early-stage venture strategy and invests in innovative technology companies developing applications, businesses, and products being deployed on Cardano and in other R&D projects IOG is working on.\nThe c in the name is a reference to the mathematical term coefficient which refers to the multiplier of a variable. Leveraging both IOG s and Wave Financial s domain expertise and industry connections, cFund is positioned to create a multiplier effect for its portfolio companies in terms of growth and reach.\nIOG is focused on accomplishing two objectives. One is enabling developers to build scalable, interoperable, and sustainable blockchain-based solutions. The other is to foster financial inclusion to the underserved populations of the world. Ultimately, IOG aims to create a new financial infrastructure for emerging economies by cultivating a community of DApps and protocols deployed on Cardano and other blockchains.\nTo help IOG achieve this vision, it partnered with Wave Financial, a digital asset manager with ~$500 million in assets under management across various different strategies and products, to create cFund.\nWhile the cFund, IOG, and the Cardano Foundation all operate independently, they look for opportunities to collaborate. cFund in particular evaluates and provides strategic advice to its portfolio companies wishing to deploy on the Cardano blockchain.\ncFund is funded by third-party, high-net worth individuals, family offices, and institutional investors (including IOG). cFund looks to invest in, and partner with, leading early-stage projects and businesses that primarily have a focus on the Cardano ecosystem and associated technology. The fund is already actively deploying capital and creating partnerships across the Cardano ecosystem.\nWhen analyzing investment opportunities, cFund takes a disciplined approach that considers a multitude of factors when evaluating an opportunity. Firstly, the fund evaluates whether there is a clear need in the market for the offering a company provides and determines if other competitors can out-execute. In venture, we call this timing the market. Next, the fund evaluates the background of the team to determine if the founders have the knowledge, skills, resources, and ability to scale their company or project. The fund also considers possible exit scenarios.\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/1e357c7c-7b55-424d-9f69-f84310e982a5/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/1e357c7c-7b55-424d-9f69-f84310e982a5/)\nImage of the COTI logo\nSince one of cFund s primary objectives is to help Cardano build alliances across the blockchain space, one of the most important factors cFund considers during its due diligence process is whether or not the company can be a value-add to the Cardano ecosystem.\nOne market that cFund has been deploying capital into is Decentralized Finance (DeFi), or more broadly, what is called Open Finance. cFund s first investment in this market was COTI, a decentralized and scalable payments network for the global e-commerce market. COTI is a value-add because it plans to provide a bridge for DeFi applications wishing to deploy on the Cardano blockchain. The company is now developing ADA Pay, a gateway solution that enables merchants to accept payments in ada (the native protocol token for Cardano) with near-instant settlement. The company is also developing a stablecoin that will run on Cardano.\nImage of the BlockSwap Network logo\nAnother DeFI investment in the portfolio is BlockSwap, which is an automated liquidity protocol for proof of stake chains that allows users to re-stake their staked assets. Blockswap brings liquidity for staking activities, providing DeFi benefits to the network. Users will be able to re-stake their fully staked assets, earning yield without the use of a synthetic asset.\nImage of the Occam.Fi logo\ncFund s most recent investment in this space is Occam.Fi, a suite of DeFi solutions tailored for Cardano. The company s first product is a decentralized funding platform. Through this launchpad, the next generation of disruptive DeFi applications will be able to raise capital using the Cardano blockchain. Overall, DeFi is one of a number of markets cFund invests in, but ideally the portfolio companies must have the capability of building on the Cardano ecosystem in some capacity.\ncFund is both a capital provider, an advisor, and a partner to its portfolio companies and the broader Cardano ecosystem. Leveraging IOG and Wave Financial s resources, reputation, expertise, and network, cFund provides unparalleled access and guidance to its portfolio. cFund firmly believes in being a value-added investor. cFund aspires to be a management team's first call.\nProspective projects and businesses can reach out to Wave Financial s early-stage distribution email, or directly message and/or follow me on Twitter.\ncFund aims to be the leading early-stage venture firm that invests primarily in Cardano blockchain based technologies besides becoming an integral part of the Cardano ecosystem. In line with IOG s founding principle of cascading disruption, the idea that most of the structures that form global financial, governance and social systems are inherently unstable and thus minor perturbations can cause a ripple effect that fundamentally re-configures the entire system. cFund's goal is to identify and back technologies that force these perturbations together to push to a fair and transparent order for all stakeholders.\nThanks for your time, David.\ncFund page\nWave Financial website\nCardano website\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Epochs in Cardano?",
    "completion": "In the Cardano ecosystem, time is divided into epochs of 5 days. Between epochs, a snapshot occurs in which the ADA coin balance of the accounts is scanned. For example, if you delegate ADA coins to a pool, it will only show up after a new snapshot.\nEpochs are used as a specific accounting period for which rewards are paid. It is necessary to measure the performance of pools in terms of block production in order to reward pool operators and delegators.\nThere are 432,000 seconds in each epoch, which corresponds to the number of slots in which a new block can theoretically be created. The protocol is set up so that a new block is only created in certain slots. Some slots will remain empty. In certain slots, randomly selected pools get a chance to create a block. The assigned pool is called a slot leader. Pools have an economic incentive to create a block in assigned slot, since pool operators get rewarded for doing so, along with all delegators who delegated ADA coins to that pool. However, it may happen that due to technological problems, for example, a new block will not be created.\nAll epochs have a similar meaning. If you look at the epochs from the perspective of newly delegated coins to the pool, you could distinguish 5 epochs between the delegation process and the first reward: Delegation, Stake registration, Skate usage, Reward calculation, Reward distribution. If you look at it through the eyes of multiple delegators, you will see that our artificially named epochs run in parallel. Someone has just delegated their coins for the first time, another user's stake has just been used by the pool in that epoch, other users are already getting rewards.\nIf you delegate ADA coins 1 day before a new snapshot, you must wait one epoch (5 days) before the pool can use your stake in the next epoch (another 5 days). It takes another one epoch to calculate the rewards (5 days). In the next epoch the rewards are distributed. You need to wait 15-20 days (at least 3 epochs) before you receive your first reward. After that, you can expect to receive a reward every epoch.\nYou can explore all epochs since genesis here: https://cexplorer.io/epoch\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Understand Cardano via Cexplorer.io?",
    "completion": "It can be difficult for the average user to understand how a blockchain network works because they can t touch and view it. Various tools that monitor the network and provide users with information in an understandable form can help with analysis. Learn how to use https://cexplorer.io.\nMost users interact with the Cardano network through wallets or the interface of decentralized applications. This is good, as users should be insulated from technical details and use should be as simple as possible. However, in the case of public networks, it is good to have some understanding of how they work. The theory is a good basis, but people may need to be in some closer connection with the network. For this, they need analytical tools to help them explore the network, look at events, or track various statistics.\nThis is useful for staking, for example. Users know that by holding ADA coins they can participate in the security and decentralization of the network. Practically, this means that they have to choose the right pool to which they delegate their ADA coins. Therefore, it is necessary to use a suitable tool that shows detailed information about the pools.\nIn this article, we will try to clarify the important aspects of the Cardano network and show you the Cexplorer tool that will help you to get important information about the network. The article does not aim to completely describe all available data, but only the really important ones.\nThe Dashboard provides an overview of the most important information about the network. Specifically, if the network is running, if it is able to process transactions, what epoch we are currently in, how many ADA coins are in circulation, and how many coins are staked.\nThe most important information in Dashboard. Basic information about the price of ADA coins, epoch, staking, and assets can be found in 4 boxes.\nThere are two key roles in the Cardano ecosystem in terms of block production: pool operators and stakers. Pool operators have registered with the network to produce blocks, they become staking pool operators. They operate full nodes 24/7 and are given assignments to produce new blocks at random intervals. The frequency of block production assignments is proportional to the pool's total stake (size). The total stake of a pool consists of the number of ADA coins that the pool operator has put into his/her pool (pledge) and the ADA coins delegated to the pool by a group of stakers. Stakers increase the total stake of the pool through the process of delegation while ADA coins remain unlocked in their own wallets.\nThe operator put his 1,000,000 ADA coins (pledge) into the pool. 12 stakers have delegated ADA coins to the same pool, increasing the total stake of the pool by 1,051,155. In total, the total stake of the pool is 2,051,155.\nIn the Cardano ecosystem, time is divided into epochs of 5 days. Between epochs, a snapshot occurs in which the state of ADA coin balances on addresses are scanned. Epochs are used as a specific accounting period for which rewards are paid. The Cardano network measures the performance of pools in terms of block production in order to reward pool operators and stakers.\nThere are 432,000 seconds in each epoch, which corresponds to the number of slots in which a new block can be created. The protocol is set up so that new blocks are produced only in certain slots. Some slots will remain empty. Randomly selected pools become slot leaders in randomly selected slots. It means that a selected pool (or a few pools) is assigned the right to produce and sign a new block.\nIf you want to specify a point in time in the Cardano network, you can do so by combining epoch and slot as follows: epoch/slot. At the time of writing, the time is 343/212,079.\nWe found this information in the Dashboard, in a box called Epoch. Note that the slot number increases every second. In the progress bar, you can see when the epoch ends. In our case, it s in 2 days and 13 hours.\nYou can find more useful information related to the epoch. For example, the average block size in an epoch and blockchain increment per epoch. As you can see in the picture, the average block size is 59 and the increment is 522,4 MB. At the very bottom of the box, you can find the number of registered pools. In the picture, it is 3,174.\nA box called Live Stake gives you an overview of the most important information regarding staked coins. Cardano has capped the number of ADA coins at 45,000,000,000. Circulating supply, the number of coins currently in circulation, is 33,939,795,591 at the time of writing. This is 75.4 of the total coin supply. Every epoch, rewards are paid to pool operators and stakers, so the circulating supply will increase. By the way, if you want to know the exact figure, hover your mouse over the value and a tooltip will appear.\nThe progress bar shows the amount of staked coins from the circulating supply. As you can see, 73 of the coins are staked at the time of writing. That s 24,555,840,771 ADA coins.\nDuring the current epoch, Cardano uses the state that was valid two epochs earlier at the time the snapshot was taken. This state is called Active Stake. This state is immutable and serves as input to the network consensus. The snapshot contains information about the total stake of all pools together with all delegations. This is important information when determining slot leaders and calculating rewards. The larger the pool, the more likely it is to be given the right to produce more blocks. New delegations and pool changes do not affect the active stake.\nPeople can delegate to another pool at any time during the epoch, new pools can be registered or their settings can be changed. The state is constantly changing so it is called a Live Stake. All ongoing changes in blockchain are reflected in the live stake. The current live stake will become the active stake over the next epoch. In other words, the current state (live stake) has to wait for an epoch before it becomes the input to the network consensus (active stake).\nIf you delegate coins to a pool in the current epoch N, the coins will be used by the PoS consensus in epoch N+2.\nAt the time of writing, the live stake was 24,666,617,259 ADA coins. If you follow the figure for a while, you will see that it is constantly changing.\nAt the end of the active stake line, you can see the percentage that indicates the difference between the active stake and the live stake. At the time of writing it is 0.5 . A positive figure means that the live stake is higher than the active stake. This means that more people stake ADA coins in the current epoch than in the previous epoch.\nCexplorer can show you details of your staking rewards. In the left menu, go to More / Rewards. Copy your staking key or address from your Cardano wallet and paste it into the edit box. You will see all the rewards of the past epochs.\nCardano pays out rewards after ADA coins have been used in the active stake epoch. You must wait for one epoch after the end of the active stake epoch to be rewarded.\nNote that when you delegate ADA coins in the current epoch, i.e. in a live stake, the ADA coins are only used after one epoch has passed. Once the coins are used in active stake, you must wait for another one epoch before the reward is paid. So there are 3 epochs in between your delegation and receiving the reward.\nIf you go to More / Epochs, you will see detailed information about epochs. Of interest is information on how many blocks were minted and how many were missed (slot leaders did not produce any blocks in their slots), how many transactions took place, how many ADA coins the network collected in fees, and what the total reward was to pool operators and stakers. Rewards increase the number of coins in circulation.\nEvery staker will be looking for information on pools. These can be found by clicking on Pools in the left menu. On this page, you will find a list of all registered pools in the Cardano network and details about them. There is one pool on each line.\nA staker will only receive a reward in an epoch if the pool to which the staker has delegated ADA coins receives the reward. A pool only gets a reward if it produces at least one block in the epoch. In order for a pool to produce at least one block in an epoch, it must have a minimum total stake.\nIf you sort the pools by stake size and go from the pools with the largest total stake to the smaller ones, you will find that if a pool has a total stake of roughly under 1 million ADA coins, it is not certain to produce a block in a given epoch.\nTo prevent the existence of big pools, there is a limit to the size of rewards a pool can earn per epoch. If the number of ADA coins in the pool exceeds what is considered the saturation point, the rewards for the pool operator and stakers begin to diminish. The saturation mechanism was designed to prevent centralization. The network encourages stakers to delegate to different stake pools and incentivizes new operators to set up alternative pools.\nThe parameter K determines the number of existing pools, which is currently considered ideal. Maximum rewards for pool operators and stakers would be achieved if a few conditions were achieved. One of these conditions is that there is just the number of pools defined by parameter K, these pools are just before the saturation point, and all pools are 100 successful in producing blocks. You can calculate the saturation point by taking the number of ADA coins in circulation and dividing by K. Setting the K parameter to 500, this would be e.g: 33,939,795,591 / 500 = 67,879,591. As a staker, always make sure you delegate coins to a pool that is not saturated.\nLet s have look at the CRDNS pool.\nYou can find a ticker of the pool in the cracked [CRDNS]. You can use the ticker to find the pool in your wallet when you want to delegate to the pool. You can also use the pool ID that you can find below the pool name.\nNext to the pool name, you will find an icon indicating whether the operator operates multiple pools or just one.\nAs you can see, it is ok to delegate to CRDNS, since the total stake is 60,447M ADA coins. The progress bar provides information about saturation which is 89 saturation. It means the pool is not saturated and has sufficient stake to produce blocks in every epoch.\nThe size of the pool determines the chances of the pool becoming a slot leader and producing a new block in the assigned slots. However, the chance is not purely proportional to pool size. For the sake of protocol security, an element of chance comes into play.\nLet s say that, based on a calculation that takes into account the proportional size of pools, a given pool has 40 slots in an epoch in which it can create a new block. This is the expected number. However, due to randomness, it may happen that a pool is assigned a larger or smaller number of slots. In the end, the pool can create either 45 or 35 blocks. Pool performance is calculated as the number of blocks that a pool has produced in a given epoch, divided by the expected number of blocks. When the pool has created 45 blocks, its performance is 112.5 . When it has only created 35 blocks, its performance is 87.5 , The pool reward per epoch reflects the performance of the pool, so it can be higher or lower.\nIt is important to know that it does not matter whether a pool is currently above or below 100 of the expected performance. Within a longer period of time, the randomness is fair so the performance is expected to be ~100 provided that the pool creates blocks in all assigned slots.\nAs you can see, the current luck of CRDNS is 65 .\nYou can also view the production history of the blocks in the pool. Next to it is an indication of how many blocks the pool is expected to produce in a given epoch and what the current state is.\nAs a staker, you should be interested in the operator s fee. Each pool operator sets two fees, a fixed fee, and a margin. The fixed fee determines the number of ADA coins the operator receives each epoch if the pool is eligible for a reward. The fixed fee minimum is set by the protocol at 340 ADA coins and is not changed by most operators. Margin is a variable component given as a percentage of the remainder of the pool reward after the fixed fee has been deducted.\nLet s take an example. A pool operator has a fixed fee set at 340 ADA coins and a margin set at 2 . The pool receives a reward of 30,000 ADA coins. The first 340 ADA coins are deducted, leaving 29,660 coins. 2 of 29,660 is 593.2 ADA coins. The pool operator gets 340 + 593.2 ADA coins, which is 933.2. There are 29,066.8 ADA coins left for all stakers, which will be split proportionally.\nAt the very end of the line, you can find the number of ADA coins that the operator has used as his own stake. It is called a pledge. CRDNS has the pledge of 500,000 ADA.\nCexplorer allows you to explore the blocks. You can look at the order number (height) of the block, what epoch and slot it was created in, and who minted it. Then you can see the number of transactions and how full the block is.\nIf you click on the magnifying glass icon, you will see the block detail including all transactions.\nIt often happens that you send a transaction to someone and would like to see the details. Each transaction has a Transaction ID (TID). Copy the TID and go to Transactions on the left menu in Cexplorer. There is a magnifying glass icon in the upper left. Paste the TID into the edit box and confirm with the ENTER button.\nYou can see when the transaction occurred by the date. You can also find out it in blockchain time, i.e. by a combination of epoch and slot (343/290956). Total Output is the total amount of coins (or tokens) that were sent in the transaction. Remember that in the UTXO accounting model, some of the coins may go back into your wallet. You can also see the transaction fee. On the right you can find the number of confirmations, that is, the number of blocks that follow the block in which the transaction is. Next, you can see the size of the transaction that affects the fee.\nIf you scroll down, you will find details of addresses and UTXOs.\nIn the left part, you can see 7 UTXO inputs to the transaction, and in the right part 2 UTXO outputs of the transaction. You can see that the transaction sent 21.4 ADA and 1.63 ADA. The red arrow tells you that 21.4 ADA was sent to the external address, so 1.63 ADA was returned to the original wallet.\nLet s explain how value is moved in Cardano networks through UTXO. UTXOs are on blockchain addresses and carry some value. For example, ADA coins. When Alice wants to send 125 ADA to Bob, Alice s wallet must select the appropriate UTXOs. In our case, the wallet has selected 3 UTXOs with ADA coins worth 50, 50, and 30. These UTXOs will be the input of the transaction. You can see that the input value is 130 ADA, which is more than Alice wants to send. It usually happens that the exact value is not available in the wallet, so part of the value sent will be returned to Alice s wallet in the form of a new UTXO. In addition, there is a transaction fee, in our example, it is 0.2 ADA. Transactions transform input UTXOs into output UTXOs. Note that the value is retained and the output is the new UTXOs with a value of 130 ADA. UTXO with a value of 125 ADA for Bob, 0.2 ADA is the transaction fee, so Alice gets a new UTXO with a value of 4.8 in her wallet.\nYou would see a Total Output of 129.8 in Cexplorer. Outputs would have value 2. The fee would be 0,2 ADA. On the left side, you would see 3 UTXOs with values of 50, 50, and 30 ADA. On the right side, you would see two output UTXOs with values of 125 and 4.8 ADA. The UTXO with a value of 125 ADA would have a red arrow icon so you would know it is an external wallet.\nIn the left menu, you will find the Analytics section where you can explore the network from different angles.\nIf you are interested in how decentralized the Cardano network is, go to Decentralization / Groups (Donuts).\nFor example, you may find operators who operate multiple pools. These operators control a large percentage of the total stack, i.e. all the coins that are used for stacking at any given time. At the time of writing, this is more than 24B ADA coins. As can be seen in the image below, the largest stake of one entity is the total stake of all pools of the Binance exchange.\nYou can also look at the number of pools each group operates.\nYou can see below the charts for more information on each group.\nYou can find a lot of other information, such as network capacity and current usage, number of transactions, power consumption, block producers, new pools, updated pools, new delegations, etc.\nCexplorer.io is a useful tool to help you find the staking pool, find details about transactions, and also to analyze the network.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

The Cardano Foundation's developer portal provides another valuable jump off point to reach multiple resources.\nPlutus Community Docs (PCD) is the latest addition to this growing list of community-centric platforms created by the community and for the community, meeting the rising demand for detailed technical content.\nPCD will become a central source that promotes & gathers the most valuable developer documentation ranging from setting up an environment to DApp development, best practices & open-source community tools.\nThere now exists a wealth of Plutus-related documentation.\nThere are Plutus-related YouTube channels, for example, and hundreds of GitHub repos created and maintained by the community.\nCardano's design ethos and the community's passion enable a strong focus on building secure solutions with real-world utility.\nNew programming languages require support through documentation, tutorials, user guides, and a community of experts and mentors driving learning across the community. This is a growing trend since the first cohort of Plutus Pioneers. Students have stepped-up and carried the pioneering flag with avid members sharing their solutions in the form of guides and one-to-one conversations on Discord.\nAs a result, the community now has a growing list of useful notes and guides to learn from. IOG helped the community organize and gather all of these resources into a central place. At a high-level, in the site you can find:\nEnvironment set-up - includes instructions to get your environment ready, covering different alternatives for different operating systems using Nix.\nPlutus Pioneer documentation - A detailed guide to follow along the lectures of the latest Plutus Pioneer iteration plus solutions to the homeworks.\nMarlowe Pioneer documentation - soon to come\nOther notable benefits of PCD over official documentation include:\nFast to Update: The site can be updated quickly and regularly, enabling fast feedback and turnaround of updates..\nVaried Content: PCD is accessible to all projects building tools on Cardano and it contains the latest content in terms of best practices for development.\nBecome a docs collaborator and earn reputation: Regular and significant contributions might get you invited to become a collaborator. This gives you reputation within the community, a special Discord tag (Community Docs Contributor), and the ability to drive open source development.\nThe most important aspect for the success of decentralized collaboration are the mechanics established for contributing. This is summarized below and mentions the most important ideas. For a more detailed description of how to contribute refer to our guide.\nPlease identify if there is something missing in the Plutus Community Docs website that you would like to add or update.\nPlease carefully read the site and documentation available as reviewing PRs takes considerable time and effort from collaborators and site maintainers.\nAll developers can expect a ton more content on PCD about Plutus and Marlowe, including new tools and new industry-standard guides to break through into development. But this is only possible through community collaboration, thus you are invited to contribute. IOG will help organize challenges to populate the site for the greatest benefit of the Cardano community.\nI would like to give a big shoutout to all documentation creators from:\nFirst & second Plutus Pioneer cohorts: NStankov#3321, Rik G#8569, zarej#3886, and matthias BNR#0450\nIOG: dino#0980, Igodlab#3499 and Larry Adames\nCommunity Docs Contributors: Strange3s#2671, Whatever [SIDAN]#3725, Deceptikon#9964, ingelran#8323, jhampac#0690, blackFlyingShark#4644, carleryd#0762, R2#3029, selipso#3964, pgwada#0227, stake_pool#2988, WoofPool#8486, and a special thanks for putting an extra effort to Totes#5706 and jmhoms#7394.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Freeloaderz DAO and Token?",
    "completion": "Freeloaderz is a grassroots Cardano project that is being built for the community by the community. It began when several stake pools started working together to alleviate network congestion. In a very short time, the project has grown exponentially. Freeloaderz is now supported by the work of over 12 developers, 60 stake pool operators and a discord community of over 800. Like any organization of this size, it requires some structure. In order to allow Freeloaderz to reach its full potential, a DAO was created to allow for both organization and community governance.\nThe DAO structure was chosen because it is most compatible with the mission and vision of the core Freeloaderz members. A DAO, Decentralized Autonomous Organization, provides organizational structure that is not hierarchical. This is perfect for Freeloaderz in that it provides a Cardano based framework for long term management and governance of the project. In this way, anyone can submit a proposal for a project and the community can vote it up or down. All of this is above board and visible on the blockchain. Freeloaderz is now, and intends to forever remain, a resource for the Cardano community.\nThis brings us to the Freeloaderz token, FLZ. The token has one purpose, which is a mechanism for governance of the Freeloaderz DAO. As with any token, holders have the freedom to swap FLZ for other tokens and to assign value. This, however, is not the purpose of the FLZ token from the Freeloaderz organizational perspective. The only functional purpose of the FLZ token from our perspective is that of a governance token. There is no intent to create long term inherent value outside of the Freeloaderz organization. The token is understood to be an empowerment tool for the user, nothing more.\nFLZ, has been deployed to be used for voting on measures related to the FreeLoaderz organization. FLZ will initially be deployed to the Cardano Community to be claimed via SmartClaimz as part of our Promotional Stake Pool Offering and Community Member AirDrop. These tokens will have a high degree of utility, including the ability to vote on which projects will be deployed on SmartClaimz. They may also be used for voting on measures related to improving the products and services provided by the FreeLoaderz DAO and member improvement proposals to accomplish tasks that either any FreeLoaderz Community Member proposes or those put out by FreeLoaderz Core Contributors. These votes will ultimately be conducted on-chain by FLZ token holders.\n500,000,000 flz tokens have been minted (see policyID here) with the tokenomics schedule outlined below.\nInitial Core Contributors (3.0 ): 10,000 FLZ tokens will be given to Initial Core Contributors up front at the time of the Active Community Member AirDrop, followed by 1 year commitment. After 1 year, Initial Core Contributors will receive 250,000 FLZ tokens every 6 months until 1 million FLZ is given to each Initial Core Contributor\nPromotional Stake Pool Offering (PSPO) (1.5 ): 50 FLZ tokens will be distributed to delegators of Single Pool Alliance (SPA) and FreeLoaderz stake pools to promote interest in FreeLoaderz and SPA to the wider Cardano community. The PSPO will last for at least 12 epochs. The SmartClaimz platform (rwd.freeloaderz.io), developed by FreeLoaderz, will be used for initial deployment of the FLZ tokens, with a set amount of 50 tokens to each delegator every epoch. Rewards will accumulate so delegators can claim tokens whenever they desire.\nFreeLoaderz Community Member AirDrop (0.5 ): 2500 FLZ tokens will be distributed to FreeLoaderz Community Members who were in the FreeLoaderz Discord before a snapshot is taken. FreeLoaderz will create a list of white-listed addresses of Active Community Members after the snapshot. FreeLoaderz Community Members with these white-listed addresses will be able to claim the FLZ tokens at the SmartClaimz platform (rwd.freeloaderz.io).\nFreeLoaderz Treasury (76.6 ): The treasury of FreeLoaderz holds the majority of the FLZ GovTokens and is controlled by all GovToken holders. This ensures that funds cannot be spent without reaching consensus. To be able to spend from the treasury a formal proposal has to be created and voted on by token holders, following the outlined Proposal Process. If the proposal passes the vote funds will be released to the wallet address mentioned in the proposal.\nFreeLoaderz Proposal Program (18.4 ): FLZ will be paid out to individuals who complete work for the FreeLoaderz DAO, whether through submission of their own proposal or those posted by FreeLoaderz. These rewards will be voted on by the FreeLoaderz token holders before dispensation of FLZ tokens and any work completed.\nThe team has worked diligently to create a structure that will allow Freeloaderz to become a long term resource for the Cardano community. At its core, Freeloaderz is a group of interested parties working together to create enhancements for the Cardano ecosystem. The DAO and token are part of the framework to insure the organization's long term viability. We invite you to join our discord to learn more about our organization and the things we are building for the future.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "Blockchain technology explained and what it could mean for the Caribbean?",
    "completion": "Blockchain has five properties that make it a potentially transformative and disruptive technology:\nA protocol establishes a set of rules in the form of distributed mathematical computations that ensures the integrity of the data exchanged among a large number of computing devices without going through a trusted third party. Each block is run on computers provided by volunteers around the world, there is no central database to hack into, corrupt, or shut down. This means that things of high value money, stocks, bonds, intellectual property rights, music, cars, and even votes can be stored and exchanged without an institution or middlemen.\nBlockchain uses a two-key authentication system to maintain virtual security.\nIn the case of a public blockchain, anyone can view all the transactions that reside on the network so no person or institution can hide a transaction. Since blockchain is open-source, anyone can download it and use it. Satoshi imagined a world in which any person can interface with the blockchain through a simplified payment verification mode that can be used on a mobile device. No documentation or physical presentation of proof is required to be trusted or to gain access.\nWithin minutes all transactions are verified, cleared, and stored in a block that is linked to the preceding block, thereby creating a chain. Each block must refer to the preceding block to be valid. This structure permanently timestamps and stores information about value exchange, preventing anyone from altering the ledger records.\nSince blockchain is a distributed ledger representing a network consensus of every transaction that has ever occurred, the blockchain must be preserved in its entirety. Storage matters a great deal. It allows the provenance of products, art, and diamonds to be traced easily.\nThe value of this new technology is that it allows trusted transactions to occur directly between two or more total strangers, authenticated by mass collaboration on a network of interlinked devices, and motivated by collective self-interest, rather than by profit-motivated corporations or governments motivated by maintaining power and perhaps being interested in surveilling its citizens or stifling dissent. Blockchain in short eliminates middlemen.\nThese properties allow developers to elaborate applications for a number of different purposes.\nActual and potential applications\n* Financial Services\nBitcoin is the first and most prominent application of blockchain technology as an e-payment system. Bitcon was created in January 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto as a digital currency independent of any central authority, transferable electronically, and with very low transaction costs. A stable and widely accepted cryptocurrency stands to revolutionize e-commerce, money transfers, and even letters of credit. Cryptocurrency poses a challenge to traditional banking. Besides Bitcoin there are other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Peercoin, Namecoin, and others. To date, the value of cryptocurrencies have fluctuated widely as they struggle to gain widespread use. Nonetheless, the top ten cryptocurrences have a market capitalization of US$98.8 billion as of June 2017 but this amount is still a miniscule value of the total value of financial assets worldwide.\nIt can be used in retail and services. Any merchant who accepts digital money as payment can exchange their goods and services. Individuals and companies involved in a supply value chain can use private blockchains to reduce transaction costs in their business relationships and make payments and transfers on the chain as well as pass information in a very transparent manner. For creative artists and craftspersons, using blockchain along with digital media management technologies may allow them to directly market their wares, reduce piracy of electronic media, and assure quick and accurate payments.\nIdentity theft is emerging as a bane of the digital age. Currently taking precautions against identify theft and attempting to restore identity after it has been compromised is an $18.5 billion annual business and growing yearly according to Distil Networks. Using blockchain technologies would make the tracking and managing of digital identities both secure, efficient and low-cost. Identity could be uniquely authenticated in an irrefutable, immutable, and secure manner and would revolutionize online commerce, passports, e-residency, birth certificates, wedding certificates, and work-related or government-issued IDs.\nTwo of the biggest hurdles to electronic poll place machines and online voting is the fear that security can be breached and that votes can be manipulated. Using blockchain, a voter could verify if his or her vote was successfully transited and remain anonymous and because of the distributed ledger technology it would not be possible to alter a vote once casted. The ability to hold e-voting could help reduce the high rates of non-participation in leading western democracies and reduce travel and wait times for countries with mandatory voting. In weak and factionalized democracies where the temptation to rig votes is high, blockchain would help preserve the sanctity of the vote and reduce fraud and subsequently reduce the disruptions caused by recounts or prolonged protests against voting exercises that are perceived as tainted.\nLegally binding programmable digitized contracts can be written on a blockchain and can be programmed to release funds once terms and conditions are met, reducing the need for lawyers and intermediary organizations such as banks. Notary publics can be replaced by having a digital proof of existence that allows users to upload a file and pay a transaction fee and to have cryptographic proof of it included on the blockchain. The block timestamp becomes the record s timestamp.\nChallenges\nDespite the tremendous potential of the technology, if governance and stewardship issues are not resolved, blockchain technology may fail to live up to expectations. The stakeholders in the system are usually innovators, venture capitalists, financial institutions, program and application developers, internet activists, academics, and NGOs. They all have to combine and come to some basic agreement on three levels and create self-policing and regulating bodies. Since no state actors are active in this realm, the stakeholders have to collaborate, identify common interests, and create incentives to act for the communal good. Just as the early internet pioneers rejected hierarchy and acted based on rough consensus constantly improving the code they wrote, this generation of the internet will need leadership and broad cooperation.\nPlatform: Standards or protocols are needed to govern scalability (block size versus average bandwidth enjoyed by users), energy consumption, stability (switching from proof or work to proof of stake), and robustness of the network infrastructure in order to assure long-term success.\nApplications: Some oversight is needed to ensure user-friendly interfaces and how to increase the pool of skilled developers.\nLegal structure for stewardship: The ecosystem needs a governance body to coordinate on matters such as interoperability, privacy, security, protection of identity, and actions to reduce the amount of legal uncertainty surrounding emergent technologies. They need to spur more investments in research and confront incoming challenges from legacy operators and hackers that exploit open-source coding to commit terrorist acts. On one hand, premature and heavy-handed top-down legislation or regulation could stifle the development of blockchain technology. On the other, a high level of disorganization and anarchy could prevent widespread adoption and deployment of the technology. As an open platform, users can use the technology for nefarious purposes that could be viewed as violating common core values and drawing the scrutiny of public authorities. Most recently the hackers behind WannaCry ransomware that affected 160,000 computers worldwide and caused an estimated $4 billion in damages, demanded payment via Bitcoin because of the anonymity of the system. Large corporations with vested interest in a closed paradigm and wealthy dictators bent on repression could use applications and networks they control for their own narrow interests. Whether a formal bottom-up multistakeholder governance structure, an invisible, informal, collaborative force, or attempts by state-backed institutions to impose limits remains to be seen.\nPossible applications in the Caribbean\nIn the Caribbean, blockchain technology could be applied in the following areas:\n(1) Migrant remittances where a reduction in transaction costs could help some of the most remittance dependent countries such as Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Guyana\n(2) International business transfers facilitation as many of the regional banks face the loss of correspondent banking relationships (de-risking) with major money center banks due to a cost benefit analysis: small market size versus the high costs of compliance associated with anti-money laundering statutes\n(3) Voting, especially in jurisdictions with contentious elections such as Haiti where complaints about voter irregularities are common\n(4) Smart contracting that could reduce the cost of doing business and revolutionize public sector contract and procurement systems\n(5) Digital identities in a region that is both a high source of outbound migration and where the majority of economies are tourist-dependent and receive millions of visitors each year. A better checking of identities will facilitate emigration and reduce the hassle to process visitors.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

    "prompt": "The Clarity Protocol whitepaper?",
    "completion": "Clarity Protocol\nWhite Paper v1\nClarity: Open Collaboration DAO tooling Smart Contract Library Protocol on the Cardano Blockchain\nClear Contracts and MLabs\nVersion 1.1\nFebruary 2022\nWe believe human prosperity will be decided at the intersection of cutting edge technology, transparency, and human collaboration. Our mission is to make equitable global financial and governance systems more accessible. To take steps toward this vision and mission, we are building the Clarity Protocol.\nThe Clarity Protocol is a library of smart contracts that focuses on creating optimal conditions and incentives to enable decentralized and fair economic growth. At its core, Clarity is an ecosystem where organizations, entrepreneurs, and investors can pool, manage, and govern capital securely, efficiently, and in a decentralized manner.\nBy allowing democratized access to a library of audited smart contracts serving as DAO infrastructure, organizations and communities can organize, govern and manage themselves in a novel and innovative way.\nClarity is a protocol built to be user friendly, allowing even non technical DAO communities and members to be able to participate in on-chain DAO interactions. This protocol aims to lower the barrier to entry so that anyone can create, manage, and participate in DAOs that operate on-chain.\nThis paper discusses the Clarity Protocol, the technical aspects behind it, and the incentive structures it creates within the Cardano ecosystem.\n1. Introduction 3\n2. Clarity Protocol Overview 3\n3. $CLARITY, The Clarity Protocol Token 4\n4. Why Cardano? 6\n5. EUTxO and Plutus 6\n4.1 Smart Contracts 6\n4.2 Technical Considerations 6\n4.3 Extensibility 7\n4.4 Technical Challenges in the Cardano Ecosystem 7\n4.5 Protocol Logic 8\n4.6 Future Features 9\n5. Conclusion 10\nWe want to provide the Cardano ecosystem with a trustworthy, simple, and cost effective way to create, manage, and govern decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Clarity is a DApp enabled protocol that lets anyone create, manage, and govern any type of organization on the Cardano Blockchain.\nClarity provides the building blocks to form decentralized organizations in the form of streamlined DAO creation, robust treasury management, and end to end proposal execution. The governance structures of organizations built on Clarity are malleable and flexible through the ability to change and enhance the governance protocols as innovations in DAO infrastructure become accessible.\nMoreover, the Clarity protocol rewards structure financially incentivizes widespread collaboration and sharing across the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe Clarity Protocol will be the first Decentralized autonomous organization on the Cardano blockchain whose goal is to act as a platform that facilitates organizations, entrepreneurs, communities, companies, and investors to operate in a transparent, efficient, and friendly manner.\nWhether you are a community of investors wanting to operate an investment DAO, a community of educators wanting to build an educational DAO, a community of environmentalists wanting to create a climate DAO, a musician who wants to interact with their fanbase via a DAO, or a group of friends who want to operate a DAO, Clarity provides a non-technical solution for anyone to make their idea a reality.\nWe are building this protocol to ignite the next generation of communities to come together in a transparent, innovative, and novel way.\nThe protocol will have set parameters and rules that will govern the operations of the DAO. These parameters and rules can be amended, added, or omitted by the governance of the protocol. The governance of the protocol will be decided by votes of $CLARTY token holders.\nAnother paramount role of the foundational Clarity smart contract library will be to verify membership of organizations/communities/companies in the network and verify the individuals are following established rules.\nThe network will generate revenue in the form of fees that are charged when interacting with the smart contract library. These fees are split between the Clarity treasury, the Clarity rewards pool, and to the developer of the contract involved in the interaction. This fee split serves to contribute to internal capital, incentivize stake within the protocol, and also incentivize technical innovators to contribute to the protocol.\nThe main services of the Clarity Protocol:\nProvide an end-to-end interface to allow everyone to create DAOs, manage treasuries, and provide end-to-end proposal execution.\nCreate a protocol that financially incentivizes collaboration and sharing of breakthrough technologies involving DAO infrastructure.\nAs DAOs continue to gain traction and their utility is realized across industries and verticals, the Clarity protocol will provide the next generation of companies with the tools they need to get their DAO off the ground.\n$CLARITY will serve as a utility and governance token, governing the Clarity protocol. The Clarity ecosystem will reward holders with fees derived from protocol usage. Holders of this token will be able to:\nCreate and vote on proposals to dictate the direction of the protocol\nEarn rewards and take part in the revenue distribution incentive model\nRevenue Distribution model:\nRevenue Distribution Incentive Model:\nDeveloper of Smart Contract Template\nClarity Treasury\nStaking Rewards\nDAO tooling does not yet exist on Cardano which helps make us a non-consensus high upside solution. We will bring to market a product that the Cardano community is actively looking for.\nCardano s ecosystem is built to be extremely friendly to community organizations. The Cardano ecosystem believes that DAOs will be a cornerstone of blockchain innovation.\nWe are deeply integrated in the Cardano ecosystem and have community support and funding. We actively work with many communities and partners within the ecosystem and form mutually beneficial collaborative relationships.\nCardano has reliably low transaction fees and lower energy consumption compared to PoW competitors.\nSmart Contracts executed on Cardano are formally verifiable.\nThe functionality of smart contracts on Cardano s EUTxO model are encompassed by two different scopes:\nOn-Chain: A set of Plutus scripts run by nodes during transaction validation. These verify a transaction constructed Off-Chain.\nOff-Chain: Business logic that builds transactions according to specified rules defined in the On-Chain scripts.\nSmart contracts deployed on the Cardano blockchain are written in the programming language called Plutus, a derivative of Haskell.\nHaskell: A functional programming language that can be verified through formal proofs.\nPlutus: A Derivative of Haskell created specifically for Cardano to enable for robust, formally verifiable smart contract script development.\nBoth of these scopes can be provided to the user in a secure, decentralized way, which keeps the user in control of their data, and allows for protocols to be extended and integrated together.\nThe Clarity Smart Contracts will include the following On-Chain structures:\nManager Contract - used to register and unregister DAO s managed by the system\nDAO Template Contract - manages staking, voting, and rewards for a single organization\nVoting Template Contracts - voting for forum threads, treasury spending, update voting rules\nTreasury Template Contract - fund management for DAOs\nClarity smart contracts are built by design to be extensible. This mechanism would allow a DApp developer to implement voting and rewards systems that integrate directly with their custom protocol. This allows many protocols to begin DAO operation before launching the protocol, without needing to change once the protocol goes live. This can include direct interaction with a live protocol such as setting interest rates in a DeFi application using DAO voting procedures.\nAdditionally, this would allow developers to post plug-in contracts that integrate with the DAO Template contracts to continually extend its feature set.\nThe goal of this protocol is to be a community driven, self-evolving library of smart contracts that serves the needs of the community, and to push the boundaries of innovation within the DAO tooling landscape.\nThe Cardano Ecosystem, like many blockchain ecosystems, is facing a number of challenges:\nCongestion\nSmart contract parallel and concurrent behavior\nPlutus Application Backend (PAB) development\nDeveloper availability\nClarity offers the following plan to address each of the above:\nCongestion: Clarity will offer the most efficient smart contract approach to DAO setup possible, including escrow and batching systems as needed to ensure a positive user experience, even in the face of chain congestion.\nParallel and Concurrent behavior: Clarity DAO s are designed to avoid state-contention in every user interaction. Users will not face issues relating to concurrent smart contract behavior.\nPAB Development: MLabs has developed a utility library for constructing smart contract transactions that replaces PAB. This is in use today and is well-maintained. We do not depend on the PAB.\nDeveloper Availability: MLabs has partnered with Clear Contracts and has a vested interest in both the short and long term success of the protocol. MLabs has more than 100 smart contract engineers, many of whom boast Haskell and Plutus experience. This provides Clarity with unparalleled access to strong developer resources now and into the future.\nClarity is being built to accommodate the following features on chain in a version 2 release:\nTreasury Yield Optimizations\nDAO Lending\nAdditional voting structures/systems\nOnchain conflict resolution\nPlug-in contract portal\nDispute Resolution optimizations\nThe Clarity protocol is the first DAO tooling of its kind available on the Cardano blockchain. By creating a smart contract library for DAO tooling, the Clarity protocol creates a set of incentives that prioritizes collaboration over competition in the Cardano ecosystem. This fundamental innovation to how knowledge can be shared for profit in Cardano can easily be applied to other domains beyond DAOs, including DeFi, DApps, DCompanies, and beyond.\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

Cardano . Ada . What do these words mean and what do they have to do with each other?\nWhy should I care, and how do they relate to each other and myself in an increasingly globalised, digital world?\nThese words and concepts may mean very little to most people.\nAt Sustainable ADA we aim to help people make sense of these words and concepts with our focused news insights on projects in the Cardano ecosystem. Projects focused on building a better world for all.\nA world where what connects us speaks volumes more than what separates us, if we care to listen rather than just hear.\nWith any disruptive technology that sends paradigm shifting shockwaves throughout the world, a degree of human fear and misunderstanding is to be expected.\nHowever, in the so-called information era where information overload is real. Where fake news, misinformation and disinformation lurks in the shadows and in plain sight. Bad actors and profit seeking opportunists seek to prey and capitalise on our online searches, data cookie crumb trail, social media profiles and digital selves, in turn shaping the views and actions of each and every unsuspecting, uncritical mind.\nFlashback to 2008, with riots over rising food prices, global unrest and outrage on the rise, whilst trust in Government, authorities and the experts plummeting to significant lows. Moral hazard leading to an unprecedented bailout of banks considered too big to fail in an effort to prevent the collapse of an exploitative system. And so the stage was set. Enter Bitcoin.\nBitcoin, the first blockchain project, was invented by an unknown person/s known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin heralded the arrival of a new era of financial freedom for the masses. A tool enabling us to be our own bank . Free from any and all interference and censorship from centralised entities be it a Government, corporation or bank.\nFor the first time outside of the creased pages of science fiction novels and cypherpunk forums, an elegant fusion of cryptography and computer science brought the concept of decentralised ledger technologies for revolutionary ends to the world.\nEver since, there has been increasing online searches, media attention and coverage of blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, as thousands of projects sought to market their own offering in the competitive new space of decentralised ledger technologies and cryptocurrencies pioneered by Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nNews reports have risen in tandem with the rise in google searches of Bitcoin , Blockchain , Cryptocurrencies and Cardano since the Pandemic started, as millions went online, looking for solutions to the glaring and widening disparities and inequities afflicting millions who lost their livelihoods amidst the health crisis.\nCOP26 has arrived this November having been postponed from last year. An annual event held this year in Glasgow where world leaders, private sector giants and civil society come together for climate talks and commitments.\nWith the search for solutions and the much needed finance to bring these solutions to scale as urgent as ever, what role does decentralised ledger technologies play in this global struggle and what will its influence be upon society, economies and the natural world we are inextricably dependent on?\nAccording to McKinsey, Blockchain comes in at #7 in their top 10 tech trends that will shape the coming decade. With the UN Sustainable Development Goals having set 2030 as the target year to fulfill all 17 goals, including goals such as No Poverty and Quality Education for All , this decade has been labelled the decade of action where no one is left behind.\nTech trends affect all sectors, but their impact varies by industry.\nImage credit: McKinsey & C\nBitcoin s alleged energy consumption concerns have recently come under the spotlight in the news. Elon Musk s tweets and decision to go from buying Bitcoin to stop accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment due to environmental concerns led to frenzied markets as retail investors FOMO or institutional investors bought the dip amidst a heat wave of diamond hand GIFs and memes.\nTo an onlooker, for all its utopian visions of technology empowering the disempowered and banking the unbanked or underbanked, crypto market behaviour is yet to be disentangled from and subject to human psychology and speculation.\nWith the multi trillion dollar cryptocurrency market making overnight millionaires and billionaires due to its volatile price action, while marked by an index wavering between fear and greed, perhaps we are still a way away from these markets being free from human sentiment and speculation.\nIn a warming world, where climate change tops the list of international concerns, with the UN signalling a Code Red for Humanity , the alarm has been sounded (though many would argue the alarm has been ringing for quite some time).\nThis is an alarm that is heard through a myriad of narratives, complexly intertwined and interrelated with geopolitical and power struggles over a range of diverse issues to do with cybersecurity, data, governance, education, global supply chains, identity, human rights, borders, energy, land resource management and property rights to name just a few.\nThe need for climate friendly, equitable solutions and alternatives to effectively transition and decouple ourselves from a global financial system and modes of production that have led to this mess we're in have inspired the rise of green technologies and green blockchains.\nDecentralised ledger technologies, such as Cardano s Proof of Stake blockchain is offering solutions to wicked problems that plague us all to varying degrees. Since 2015, Cardano has risen to sit in the top 3 of the multi trillion dollar cryptocurrency market, and is increasingly known as the leading green blockchain of choice.\nWith arguably the largest, active community in the cryptocurrency blockchain space, I too joined tens of thousands of attendees for the 2-day online Cardano Summit event on 25th-26th September.\nMy avatar exploring and island hopping, collecting NFTs in this digital world created for the Cardano Summit.\nFor those who missed the chance to attend a live Cardano Summit 2021 meetup or the Summit virtually online, fret not as all presentations were recorded and are accessible via this link: https://summit.cardano.org/sessions\nA stellar line-up of thinkers and doers across sectors and disciplines from around the world came together to discuss a range of pertinent issues and age-old problems, explored throughout the 117 freely accessible thought-provoking talks. This in of itself highlights the strength of a decentralised, open access community focusing on harnessing minds and tools to overcome local and global challenges.\nTo assist you on your journey in connecting the dots, here at Sustainable ADA we have put together a shortlist of talks that delve into discussions, sharing insights and projects that are working with positive social and sustainable impact.\nSo, check out our next post that highlights selected talks from the Cardano Summit that shed light on how Cardano's innovative technology is instrumental in delivering positive change for our planet and for all, led by change agents known as 'block changers', as named by Dr Mihaela, Input Output Chief of Strategic Impact.\nRazali Samsudin\nCo-Founder of Sustainable ADA\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content your contributions are invaluable.

We also offer definitions and explanations along the way so that the unknowledgeable users can learn and grow their understanding as they explore the Cardano ecosystem.\nEvery project on Built on Cardano is organized into an industry and has tags applied to it that allow users to refine exactly what they're looking for. Looking to mint an NFT? Simply search NFT minting. Looking for wallets to store your ada, Cardano native tokens, and NFTs? Then search wallet. Projects on Built on Cardano are tagged with all the applicable tags to make finding what you need as easy and intuitive as possible.\nThe Built on Cardano platform allows you to intuitively explore the projects and tools building on top of Cardano in a safe space and one of our rules to keep that space safe is that the content on our site is unadulterated by marketing speak. Here users can learn about what each project actually does and what they are on path to accomplishing, rather than reading uninformative statements about a project's lofty aspirations.\nThe decentralized and crypto worlds are new to many people, and those of us that are ingrained members of these communities are still learning everyday. The Built on Cardano platform offers a blog that contains informative and education content for readers of all levels, and many searches on Built on Cardano are accompanied by a definition of the searched term on the righthand side of the page. Search DeFi on Built on Cardano to see a great example!\nOrganizing a continually growing space that is built on the shoulders of its community is only possible by collecting the wisdom of the crowd. For this reason Built on Cardano offers an open door for the community submission of new projects.\nCommunity members can also provide \"viewpoints\" on the projects already listed on Built on Cardano. This allows users to use the platform to begin building their own portfolio of work in the space, which serves other users by expanding on the variety of content written about a project.\nWe conduct in-depth research into all the projects that are listed on the Built on Cardano platform. The Built on Cardano team has researched over 400 projects, and any that are highly suspect scams are removed from the site. Other's that are too young to tell whether they can go either way are tagged with a warning for users to be careful until the project can be proven to be real or is suspect enough to be removed.\nExplorers need maps and modern maps can be better than static pages of links. With our intuitive tagging system we have created an easily navigable and explorable database of the Cardano ecosystem. A place where users can search and navigate their way around using terms that are familiar to them, learning along the way, with the opportunity to collaborate and contribute their own projects and thoughts.\nWhat will you discover in Cardano today?
