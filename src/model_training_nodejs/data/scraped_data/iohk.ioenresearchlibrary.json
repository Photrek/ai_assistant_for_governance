Analysis and Improvements of DIDComm Messaging\nOctober/2024, To appear at: ACM CCS '24\nSSI\nSelf-Sovereign Identity (SSI) empowers individuals and organizations with full control over their data. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are at its center, where a DID contains a collection of public keys associated with an entity, and further information to enable entities to engage via secure and private messaging across different platforms. A crucial stepping stone is DIDComm, a cryptographic communication layer that is in production with version 2. Due to its widespread and active deployment, a formal study of DIDComm is highly overdue.\nWe present the first formal analysis of DIDComm s cryptography, and formalize its goal of (sender-) anonymity and authenticity. We follow a composable approach to capture its security over a generic network, formulating the goal of DIDComm as a strong ideal communication resource. We prove that the proposed encryption modes reach the expected level of privacy and authenticity, but leak beyond the leakage induced by an underlying network (captured by a parameterizable resource).\nWe further use our formalism to propose enhancements and prove their security: first, we present an optimized algorithm that achieves simultaneously anonymity and authenticity, conforming to the DIDComm message format, and which outperforms the current DIDComm proposal in both ciphertext size and computation time by almost a factor of 2. Second, we present a novel DIDComm mode that fulfills the notion of anonymity preservation, in that it does never leak more than the leakage induced by the network it is executed over. We finally show how to merge this new mode into our improved algorithm, obtaining an efficient all-in-one mode for full anonymity and authenticity.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary The Uber-Knowledge Assumption: A Bridge to the AGM\nOctober/2024, IACR Communications in Cryptology\nZKSNARKS\nThe generic-group model (GGM) and the algebraic-group model (AGM) have been exceptionally successful in proving the security of many classical and modern cryptosystems. These models, however, come with standard-model uninstantiability results, raising the question of whether the schemes analyzed under them can be based on firmer standard-model footing.\nWe formulate the uber-knowledge (UK) assumption, a standard-model assumption that naturally extends the uber-assumption family to knowledge-type problems. We justify the soundness of UK in both the bilinear GGM and the bilinear AGM. Along the way we extend these models to account for hashing into groups, an adversarial capability that is available in many concrete groups In contrast to standard assumptions, hashing may affect the validity of knowledge assumptions. These results, in turn, enable a modular approach to security in the GGM and the AGM.\nAs example applications, we use the UK assumption to prove knowledge soundness of Groth's zero-knowledge SNARK (EUROCRYPT 2016) and of KZG polynomial commitments (ASIACRYPT 2010) in the standard model, where for the former we reuse the existing proof in the AGM without hashing.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Blockchain Bribing Attacks and the Efficacy of Counterincentives\nOctober/2024, To appear at: ACM CCS '24\nBRIBING\nWe analyze bribing attacks in Proof-of-Stake distributed ledgers from a game theoretic perspective. In bribing attacks, an adversary offers participants a reward in exchange for instructing them how to behave, with the goal of attacking the protocol s properties. Specifically, our work focuses on adversaries that target blockchain safety. We consider two types of bribing, depending on how the bribes are awarded: i) guided bribing, where the bribe is given as long as the bribed party behaves as instructed; ii) effective bribing, where bribes are conditional on the attack s success, w.r.t. well-defined metrics. We analyze each type of attack in a game theoretic setting and identify relevant equilibria. In guided bribing, we show that the protocol is not an equilibrium and then describe good equilibria, where the attack is unsuccessful, and a negative one, where all parties are bribed such that the attack succeeds. In effective bribing, we show that both the protocol and the all bribed setting are equilibria. Using the identified equilibria, we then compute bounds on the Prices of Stability and Anarchy. Our results indicate that additional mitigations are needed for guided bribing, so our analysis concludes with incentive-based mitigation techniques, namely slashing and dilution. Here, we present two positive results, that both render the protocol an equilibrium and achieve maximal welfare for all parties, and a negative result, wherein an attack becomes more plausible if it severely affects the ledger s token s market price.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Block Ciphers in Idealized Models: Automated Proofs and New Security Results\nOctober/2024, To appear at: ACM CCS '24\nWe develop and implement AlgoROM, a tool to systematically analyze the security of a wide class of symmetric primitives in idealized models of computation. The schemes that we consider are those that can be expressed over an alphabet consisting of XOR and function symbols for hash functions, permutations, or block ciphers.\nWe implement our framework in OCaml and apply it to a number of prominent constructions, which include the Luby Rackoff (LR), key-alternating Feistel (KAF), and iterated Even Mansour (EM) ciphers, as well as substitution-permutation networks (SPN). The security models we consider are (S)PRP, and strengthenings thereof under related-key (RK), key-dependent message (KD), and more generally key-correlated (KC) attacks.\nUsing AlgoROM, we are able to reconfirm a number of classical and previously established security theorems, and in one case we identify a gap in a proof from the literature (Connolly et al., ToSC'19). However, most results that we prove with AlgoROM are new. In particular, we obtain new positive results for LR, KAF, EM, and SPN in the above models. Our results better reflect the configurations actually implemented in practice, as they use a single idealized primitive. In contrast to many existing tools, our automated proofs do not operate in symbolic models, but rather in the standard probabilistic model for cryptography.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Scalable and Lightweight State-Channel Audits\nSeptember/2024, CANS '24\nSTATECHANNEL\nPayment channels are one of the most prominent off-chain scaling solutions for blockchain systems. However, regulatory institutions have difficulty embracing them, as the channels lack insights needed for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) auditing purposes. Our work tackles the problem of a formal reliable and controllable inspection of off-ledger payment channels, by offering a novel approach for maintaining and reliably auditing statistics of payment channels. We extend a typical trustless Layer 2 protocol and provide a lightweight and scalable protocol such that:\n- every state channel is provably auditable w.r.t. a configurable set of policy queries, such that a regulator can retrieve reliable insights about the channel;\n- no information beyond the answers to auditing queries is leaked;\n- the cryptographic operations are inexpensive, the setup is simple, and storage complexity is independent of the transaction graph's size.\nWe present a concrete protocol, based on Hydra Isomorphic State Channels (FC'21), and tie the creation of a state channel to real-world identifiers, both in a plain and privacy-preserving manner. For this, we employ verifiable credentials for decentralized identifiers, specifically verifiable Legal Entity Identifiers (vLEI) that increasingly gain traction for financial service providers and regulated institutions.\nView full paper"

Typical implementations of stablecoins via smart contracts come with important downsides such as a questionable level of privacy, potentially high fees, and lack of scalability. We put forth a new design, PARScoin, for a Privacy-preserving, Auditable, and Regulation-friendly Stablecoin that mitigates these issues while enabling high performance both in terms of speed of settlement and for scaling to large numbers of users as our performance analysis demonstrates. Our construction is blockchain-agnostic and is analyzed in the Universal Composition (UC) framework, offering a secure and modular approach for its integration into the broader blockchain ecosystem.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary MUSEN: Aggregatable Key-Evolving Verifiable Random Functions and Applications\nSeptember/2024, SCN '24\nVRF\nA Verifiable Random Function (VRF) can be evaluated on an input by a prover who holds a secret key, generating a pseudorandom output and a proof of output validity that can be verified using the corresponding public key. VRFs are a central building block of committee election mechanisms that sample parties to execute tasks in cryptographic protocols, e.g. generating blocks in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain or executing a round of MPC protocols. We propose the notion, and a matching construction, of an Aggregatable Key-Evolving VRF (A-KE-VRF) with the following extra properties: 1. Aggregation: combining proofs for several VRF evaluations of different inputs under different secret keys into a single constant size proof; 2. Key-Evolving: preventing adversaries who corrupt a party (learning their secret key) from \"forging\" proofs of past VRF evaluations. As an immediate application, we improve on the block size of PoS blockchains and on the efficiency of Proofs of Proof-of-Stake (PoPoS). Furthermore, the A-KE-VRF notion allows us to construct Encryption to the Future (EtF) and Authentication from the Past (AfP) schemes with a Key-Evolving property, which provides forward security. An EtF scheme allows for sending a message to a party who is randomly selected to execute a role in the future, while an AfP scheme allows for this party to authenticate their messages as coming from a past execution of this role. These primitives are essential for realizing the YOSO MPC Framework (CRYPTO'21).\nView full paper"

This is achieved by having for each message a pseudorandomly sampled subset of participants eligible to issue an individual signature; this ensures the scalability of signing, aggregation and verification.\nWe formalize the primitive in the universal composition setting and propose e cient constructions for STMs. We also showcase that STMs are eminently useful in the cryptocurrency setting by providing two applications: (i) stakeholder decision-making for Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, specifically, Bitcoin, and (ii) fast bootstrapping for Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Competitive Policies for Online Collateral Maintenance\nSeptember/2024, AFT '24\nLayer-two blockchain protocols emerged to address scalability issues related to fees, storage cost, and confirmation delay of on-chain transactions. They aggregate off-chain transactions into fewer on-chain ones, thus offering immediate settlement and reduced transaction fees. To preserve security of the underlying ledger, layer-two protocols often work in a collateralized model; resources are committed on-chain to backup off-chain activities. A fundamental challenge that arises in this setup is determining a policy for establishing, committing, and replenishing the collateral in a way that maximizes the value of settled transactions. In this paper, we study this problem under two settings that model collateralized layer-two protocols. The first is a general model in which a party has an on-chain collateral C with a policy to decide on whether to settle or discard each incoming transaction. The policy also specifies when to replenish C based on the remaining collateral value. The second model considers a discrete setup in which C is divided among k wallets, each of which is of size C/k, such that when a wallet is full, and so cannot settle any incoming transactions, it will be replenished. We devise several online policies for these models, and show how competitive they are compared to optimal (offline) policies that have full knowledge of the incoming transaction stream. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study and formulate online competitive policies for collateral and wallet management in the blockchain setting.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Blockchain Space Tokenization\nSeptember/2024, AFT '24\nHandling congestion in blockchain systems is a fundamental problem given that the security and decentralization objectives of such systems lead to designs that compromise on (horizontal) scalability (what sometimes is referred to as the blockchain trilemma ). Motivated by this, we focus on the question whether it is possible to design a transaction inclusion policy for block producers that facilitates fee and delay predictability while being incentive compatible at the same time.\nReconciling these three properties is seemingly paradoxical given that the dominant approach to transaction processing is based on first-price auctions (e.g., as in Bitcoin) or dynamic adjustment of the minimum admissible fee (e.g. as in Ethereum EIP-1559) something that breaks fee predictability. At the same time, in fixed fee mechanisms (e.g., as in Cardano), fees are trivially predictable but are subject to relatively inexpensive bribing or denial of service attacks where transactions may be delayed indefinitely by a well funded attacker, hence breaking delay predictability.\nIn this work, we set out to address this problem by putting forward blockchain space tokenization (BST), namely a new capability of a blockchain system to tokenize its capacity for transactions and allocate it to interested users who are willing to pay ahead of time for the ability to post transactions regularly for a period of time. We analyze our system in the face of worst-case transaction-processing attacks by introducing a security game played between the mempool mechanism and an adversary. Leveraging this framework, we prove that BST offers predictable and asymptotically optimal delays, predictable fees, and is incentive compatible, thus answering the question posed in the affirmative.\nView full paper"

In proof-of-stake (PoS), a subset of stakeholders participate in validating a growing ledger of transactions. For the safety and liveness of the underlying system, it is desirable for the set of validators to include multiple independent entities as well as represent a non-negligible percentage of the total stake issued. In this paper, we study a secondary form of participation in the transaction validation process, which takes the form of stake delegation, whereby an agent delegates their stake to an active validator who acts as a stake pool operator. We study reward sharing schemes that reward agents as a function of their collective actions regarding stake pool operation and delegation. Such payment schemes serve as a mechanism to incentivize participation in the validation process while maintaining decentralization. We observe natural trade-offs between these objectives and the total expenditure required to run the relevant reward schemes. Ultimately, we provide a family of reward schemes which can strike different balances between these competing objectives at equilibrium in a Bayesian game theoretic framework.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Achieving Envy-Freeness through Items Sale\nSeptember/2024, ESA '24\nGAME-THEORY\nWe consider a fair division setting of allocating indivisible items to a set of agents. In order to cope with the well-known impossibility results related to the non-existence of envy-free allocations, we allow the option of selling some of the items so as to compensate envious agents with monetary rewards. In fact, this approach is not new in practice, as it is applied in some countries in inheritance or divorce cases. A drawback of this approach is that it may create a value loss, since the market value derived by selling an item can be less than the value perceived by the agents. Therefore, given the market values of all items, a natural goal is to identify which items to sell so as to arrive at an envy-free allocation, while at the same time maximizing the overall social welfare. Our work is focused on the algorithmic study of this problem, and we provide both positive and negative results on its approximability. When the agents have a commonly accepted value for each item, our results show a sharp separation between the cases of two or more agents. In particular, we establish a PTAS for two agents, and we complement this with a hardness result, that for three or more agents, the best approximation guarantee is provided by essentially selling all items. This hardness barrier, however, is relieved when the number of distinct item values is constant, as we provide an efficient algorithm for any number of agents. We also explore the generalization to heterogeneous valuations, where the hardness result continues to hold, and where we provide positive results for certain special cases.\nView full paper"

To address such concerns an array of definitions for order fairness has been put forth together with impossibility and feasibility results highlighting the difficulty and multifaceted nature of fairness in transaction serialization. Motivated by this we present a comprehensive modeling of order fairness capitalizing on the universal composition (UC) setting. Our results capture the different flavors of sender order fairness and input causality (which is arguably one of the most critical aspects of ledger transaction processing with respect to serialization attacks) and we parametrically illustrate what are the limits of feasibility for realistic constructions via an impossibility result. Our positive result, a novel distributed ledger protocol utilizing trusted enclaves, complements tightly our impossibility result, hence providing an optimal sender order fairness ledger construction that is also eminently practical.\nView full paper"

A number of protocols have been proposed to achieve permissionless consensus, most notably based on the Bitcoin protocol; however, to date no protocol is known that can be provably instantiated outside of the random oracle model.\nIn this work, we take the first steps towards achieving permissionless consensus in the standard model. In particular, we demonstrate that worst-case conjectures in fine-grained complexity, in particular the orthogonal vectors conjecture (implied by the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis), imply permissionless consensus in the random beacon model a setting where a fresh random value is delivered to all parties at regular intervals. This gives a remarkable win-win result: either permissionless consensus exists relative to a random beacon, or there are non-trivial worst-case algorithmic speed-ups for a host of natural algorithmic problems (including SAT).\nOur protocol achieves resilience against adversaries that control an inverse-polynomial fraction of the honest computational power, i.e., adversarial power A = T 1 for some constant 0, where T denotes the honest computational power. This relatively low threshold is a byproduct of the slack in the fine-grained complexity conjectures.\nOne technical highlight is the construction of a Seeded Proof of Work: a Proof of Work where many (correlated) challenges can be derived from a single short public seed, and yet still no non-trivial amortization is possible.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Unlinkable Policy-Compliant Signatures for Compliant and Decentralized Anonymous Payments\nJuly/2024, PETS '24\nPrivacy-preserving payment systems face the difficult task of balancing privacy and accountability: on one hand, users should be able to transact privately and anonymously, on the other hand, no illegal activities should be tolerated. The challenging question of finding the right balance lies at the core of the research on accountable privacy that stipulates the use of cryptographic techniques for policy enforcement. Current state-of-the-art systems are only able to enforce rather limited policies, such as spending or transaction limits, or assertions about single participants, but are unable to enforce more complex policies that for example jointly evaluate both, the private credentials of sender and recipient, such as admissible cross-border payments, let alone to do this without auditors in the loop during payment. This severely limits the cases where decentralized virtual assets can be used in accordance with regulatory compliance such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) travel rule, while further retaining strong privacy features.\nWe present unlinkable Policy-Compliant Signatures (ul-PCS), an enhanced cryptographic primitive extending the work of Badertscher et al. (TCC 21). We give rigorous definitions, formally proven constructions, and benchmarks using our prototype developed using CharmCrypto. Unlinkable PCS has the following unique combination of features:\n1. It is an enhanced signature scheme where the public key encodes in a privacy-preserving way the user's verifiable credentials (obtained from a credential authority).\n2. Signatures can be created (and later publicly verified) by additionally specifying a recipient's public key aside of the to-be-signed message. A valid signature can only ever be created if the attributes xS of the signer and the attributes xR of the receiver fulfill some global policy F(xS, xR).\n3. The signature can be created by the signer just knowing the recipient's public key; there is no further interaction needed no attributes are leaked (beyond the validity of the policy).\n4. Once credentials are obtained, a user can generate fresh public keys without interacting with the credential authority.\nBy merging the act of signing a transaction with the act of providing an assurance about the involved participants being compliant with complex policies, yet retain that participants are able to change addresses without the involvement of an authority, we show how ul-PCS constitutes a crucial step towards achieving a technology that improves regulatory compliance of privacy coins such as Monero or Zcash.\nView full paper"

Despite this, the transaction fee mechanisms currently deployed in popular platforms as well as previous modeling attempts for the associated mechanism design problem focus on an approach that favors increasing prices in favor of those clients who value immediate service during periods of congestion. To address this issue, we introduce a model that captures the traffic diversity of blockchain systems and a tiered pricing mechanism that is capable of implementing more inclusive transaction policies. In this model, we demonstrate formally that EIP-1559, the transaction fee mechanism currently used in Ethereum, is not inclusive and demonstrate experimentally that its prices surge horizontally during periods of congestion. On the other hand, we prove formally that our mechanism achieves stable prices in expectation and we provide experimental results that establish that prices for transactions can be kept low for low urgency transactions, resulting in a diverse set of transaction types entering the blockchain. At the same time, perhaps surprisingly, our mechanism does not necessarily sacrifice revenue since the lowering of the prices for low urgency transactions can be covered from high urgency ones due to the price discrimination ability of the mechanism.\nView full paper"

Their basic properties---consistency and liveness---can be guaranteed under specific constraints about the resources of an adversary relative to the resources of the nodes that follow the protocol. Given the intended long-livedness of these protocols, perhaps the most fundamental open security question currently is their behavior and potential resilience to temporary spikes in adversarial resources.\nIn this work we give the first thorough treatment of self-healing properties of distributed ledgers covering both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols. Our results quantify the vulnerability period that corresponds to an adversarial spike and classify three types of currently deployed protocols with respect to their self-healing ability: PoW-based blockchains, PoS-based blockchains, and iterated Byzantine Fault Tolerant (iBFT) protocols.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Are continuous stop-and-go mixnets provably secure?\nJuly/2024, PETS '24\nThis work formally analyzes the anonymity guarantees of continuous stop-and-go mixnets and attempts to answer the titular question. Existing mixnet based anonymous communication protocols that aim to provide provable anonymity guarantees rely on round-based communication models, which requires synchronization among all the nodes and clients that is difficult to achieve in practice. Continuous stop-and-go mixnets (e.g., Loopix and Nym) provide a nice alternative by adding a random delay for each message on every hop independent of all other hops and all other messages. The core anonymization technique of continuous mixnets combined with the fact that the messages are sent by the clients to the mixnet at different times makes it a difficult problem to formally prove security for such mixnet protocols; existing end-to-end analyses for such designs provide only experimental evaluations for anonymity and were lacking a comprehensive formal treatment.\nWe are the first to close that gap and provide a formal analysis. We provide two indistinguishability based definitions (of sender anonymity), namely pairwise unlinkability and user unlinkability, tuned specifically for continuous stop-and-go mixnets. We derive the adversarial advantage as a function of the protocol parameters for the two definitions. We show that there is a fundamental lower bound on the adversarial advantage for pairwise unlinkability; however, strong user unlinkability (negligible adversarial advantage) can be achieved if the users message rate ( ) is proportional to message processing rate ( ) on the nodes.\nView full paper"

Validators are system maintainers who get rewarded with tokens for performing the work necessary for the system to function properly, while users compete and pay with such tokens for getting a desired system service level.\nWe study how the system service provision and suitable rewards schemes together can lead to equilibria with desirable characteristics (1) viability: the system keeps parties engaged, (2) decentralization: multiple validators are participating, (3) stability: the price path of the underlying token used to transact with the system does not change widely over time, and (4) feasibility: the mechanism is easy to implement as a smart contract, i.e., it does not require fiat reserves on-chain for buy back of tokens or to perform bookkeeping of exponentially growing token holdings. Our analysis enables to put forward a novel generic mechanism for blockchain monetary policy that we call quantitative rewarding (QR). We investigate how to implement QR in single-token and two-token proof of stake (PoS) blockchain systems. The latter are systems that utilize one token for the users to pay the transaction fees and a different token for the validators to participate in the PoS protocol and get rewarded. Our approach demonstrates a concrete advantage of the two-token setting in terms of the ability of the QR mechanism to be realized effectively and provide good equilibria. Our analysis also reveals an inherent limitation of the single token setting in terms of implementing an effective blockchain monetary policy a distinction that is, to the best of our knowledge, highlighted for the first time.\nView full paper"

In compare with simplified models of PoS consensus, considered before in [2], we investigate two models (named Model 1 and Model 2), taking into account all features of Ouroboros Praos protocol [1]: slot creation function, active slot coefficient, possibility of empty slots and slots with multiple slot leaders (both honest and malicious), non-linear dependence between stake ratio and probability to become slot leader in some timeslot, end even non-zero synchronization time (for Model 2), measured in timeslots. In Model 1 (with zero synchronization time), we obtain explicit formulas for the exact double spend attack probability value. In Model 2 (with non-zero synchronization time), we have to make some simplification assumption in favor of the adversary. As a result, we get an upper probability estimation, using so-called dominated distribution.\nView full paper"

This problem has been extensively studied by both the distributed computing and cryptographic protocols communities. With the advent of blockchains, whose main application a distributed ledger essentially requires that miners agree on their views, new techniques have been proposed to solve the problem, and in particular in so-called \"permissionless\" environments, where parties are not authenticated or have access to point-to-point channels and, further, may come and go as they please.\nSo far, the fastest way to achieve consensus in the proof-of-work (PoW)-based setting of Bitcoin, takes O(polylog ) number of rounds, where is the security parameter. We present the first protocol in this setting that requires expected-constant number of rounds. Furthermore, we show how to apply securely sequential composition in order to yield a fast distributed ledger protocol that settles all transactions in expected-constant time. Our result is based on a novel instantiation of \"m-for-1 PoWs\" on parallel chains that facilitates our basic building block, Chain-King Consensus. The techniques we use, via parallel chains, to port classical protocol design elements (such as Phase-King Consensus, super-phase sequential composition and others) into the permissionless setting may be of independent interest.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Ordering Transactions with Bounded Unfairness: Definitions, Complexity and Constructions\nMay/2024, Eurocrypt '24\nAn important consideration in the context of distributed ledger protocols is fairness in terms of transaction ordering. Recent work [Crypto 2020] revealed a deep connection of (receiver) order fairness to social choice theory and related impossibility results arising from the Condorcet paradox. As a result of the impossibility, various relaxations of order fairness were investigated in prior works. Given that distributed ledger protocols, especially those processing smart contracts, must serialize the input transactions, a natural objective is to minimize the distance (in terms of injected number of transactions) between any pair of unfairly ordered transactions in the output ledger a concept we call bounded unfairness. In state machine replication (SMR) parlance this asks for minimizing the number of unfair state updates occurring before the processing of any transaction. This unfairness minimization objective gives rise to a natural class of parametric order fairness definitions that has not been studied before. As we observe, previous realizable relaxations of order fairness do not yield good unfairness bounds.\nAchieving optimal order fairness in the sense of bounded unfairness turns out to be connected to the graph theoretic properties of the underlying transaction dependency graph and specifically the bandwidth metric of strongly connected components in this graph. This gives rise to a specific instance of the definition that we call \"directed bandwidth order-fairness\" which we show that it captures the best possible that any protocol can achieve in terms of bounding unfairness. We prove ordering transactions in this fashion is NP-hard and non-approximable for any constant ratio. Towards realizing the property, we put forth a new distributed ledger protocol called Taxis that achieves directed bandwidth order-fairness in the permissionless setting. We present two variants of our protocol, one that matches the property perfectly but (necessarily) lacks in performance and liveness, and a second variant that achieves liveness and better complexity while offering a slightly relaxed version of the directed bandwidth definition. Finally, we comment on applications of our work to social choice theory, a direction which we believe to be of independent interest.\nView full paper"

This is largely motivated by emerging blockchain governance systems, which include voters with different weights and a massive number of community generated proposals. In such scenarios, it is natural to expect that voters will have incomplete preferences, as they may only be able to evaluate or be confident about a very small proportion of the alternatives. As a result, the election outcome may be significantly affected, leading to suboptimal decisions. Our central inquiry revolves around whether delegation of ballots to proxies possessing greater expertise or a more comprehensive understanding of the voters' preferences can lead to outcomes with higher legitimacy and enhanced voters' satisfaction in elections where voters submit incomplete preferences. To explore its aspects, we introduce the following model: potential proxies advertise their ballots over multiple issues, and each voter either delegates to a seemingly attractive proxy or casts a ballot directly. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions that could lead to a socially better outcome by leveraging the participation of proxies. We accompany our theoretical findings with experiments on instances derived from real datasets. Overall, our results enhance the understanding of the power of delegation towards improving election outcomes.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary High-Throughput Blockchain Consensus under Realistic Network Assumptions\nMay/2024\nTHROUGHPUT\nIn blockchain consensus, messages are validated based on proof-of-X, where X stands for some underlying resource such as work (PoW) or stake (PoS). Protocol message validation via such a resource lottery allows the following adverse behaviors that are seemingly antithetical to high throughput operation: (I) Protocol bursts, occur when large volumes of valid protocol messages are withheld by the adversary and released altogether with the intention of emaciating the bandwidth available to honest parties. (II) Message replays and equivocations take place when the adversary exploits PoX outcomes and hiding behind the pseudonymity of the network spams honest protocol participants with a message rate much higher than its designated PoX rate, crippling in this way the ability of honest parties to communicate effectively. Reconciling these shortcomings with high bandwidth blockchain operation has so far been unsuccessful: prior work either shies away from utilizing all available bandwidth or if it does, it introduces unrealistic network assumptions that abstract away the above adversarial behaviors.\nWe put forward Leios, a blockchain protocol overlay combining a number of techniques that may be of independent interest and reconciling the above shortcomings. Leios transforms any underlying low-throughput base protocol to a high-throughput blockchain achieving (1 ) of the optimal capacity for any constant 0. Furthermore, it impacts latency asymptotically only by a related constant hence if the underlying protocol has constant time expected settlement, the Leios overlay retains this property. Combining Leios with any underlying permissionless protocol, either in the PoS or PoW setting, we obtain for the first time a near-optimal throughput permissionless layer-1 blockchain protocol that is proven secure under realistic network assumptions.\nView full paper"

The argument is approximate because there is a small gap between what the prover actually knows and what the verifier is convinced the prover knows. This gap enables very efficient schemes.\nWe present noninteractive constructions of ALBA in the random oracle and uniform reference string models and show that our proof sizes are nearly optimal. We also show how our constructions can be made particularly communication-efficient when the evidence is distributed among multiple provers, which is of practical importance when ALBA is applied to a decentralized setting.\nWe demonstrate two very different applications of ALBAs: for large-scale decentralized signatures and for proving universal composability of succinct proofs.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Updatable Policy-Compliant Signatures\nApril/2024, PKC '24\nENHANCED SIGNATURES\nPolicy-compliant signatures (PCS) are a recently introduced primitive by Badertscher et al. [TCC 2021] in which a central authority distributes secret and public keys associated with sets of attributes (e.g., nationality, affiliation with a specific department, or age) to its users. The authority also enforces a policy determining which senders can sign messages for which receivers based on a joint check of their attributes. For example, senders and receivers must have the same nationality, or only senders that are at least 18 years old can send to members of the computer science department. PCS further requires attribute-privacy nothing about the users attributes is revealed from their public keys and signatures apart from whether the attributes satisfy the policy or not. The policy in a PCS scheme is fixed once and for all during the setup. Therefore, a policy update requires a redistribution of all keys. This severely limits the practicality of PCS. In this work, we introduce the notion of updatable policy-compliant signatures (UPCS) extending PCS with a mechanism to efficiently update the policy without redistributing keys to all participants.\nWe define the notion of UPCS and provide the corresponding security definitions. We then provide a generic construction of UPCS based on digital signatures, a NIZK proof system, and a so-called secret-key two-input partially-hiding predicate encryption (2-PHPE) scheme. Unfortunately, the only known way to build the latter for general two-input predicates is using indistinguishability obfuscation. We show that the reliance on the heavy tool of 2-PHPE is inherent to build UPCS by proving that non-interactive UPCS implies 2-PHPE.\nTo circumvent the reliance on 2-PHPE, we consider interactive UPCS, which allows the sender and receiver to interact during the message signing procedure. In this setting, we present two schemes: the first one requires only a digital signature scheme, a NIZK proof system, and secure two-party computation. This scheme works for arbitrary policies, but requires sender and receiver to engage in a two-party computation protocol for each policy update. Our second scheme additionally requires a (single-input) predicate-encryption scheme but, in turn, only requires a single interaction between sender and receiver, independent of the updates. In contrast to 2-PHPE, single-input predicate encryption for certain predicate classes is known to exist (e.g., from pairings) under more concrete and well-understood assumptions.\nView full paper"

There have been some attempts to standardize the implementation of stateful programs using this infrastructure, with varying degrees of success.\nTo remedy this, we introduce the framework of structured contracts to formalize what it means for a stateful program to be correctly implemented on the ledger. Using small-step semantics, our approach relates low-level ledger transitions to high-level transitions of the smart contract being specified, thus allowing users to prove that their abstract specification is adequately realized on the blockchain. We argue that the framework is versatile enough to cover a range of examples, in particular proving the equivalence of multiple concrete implementations of the same abstract specification.\nBuilding upon prior meta-theoretical results, our results have been mechanized in the Agda proof assistant, paving the way to rigorous verification of smart contracts.\nView full paper"

These propositions are typically devoid of economic analysis so it is a pertinent question how such aspirations fit in the wider context of monetary economic theory. In this work, we develop a framework that determines the optimal token supply policy of a cryptocurrency, as well as investigate how such policy may be algorithmically implemented. Our findings suggest that the optimal policy complies with the Friedman rule and it is dependent on the risk free rate, as well as the growth of the cryptocurrency platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate a wide set of conditions under which such policy can be implemented via contractions and expansions of token supply that can be realized algorithmically with block rewards, taxation of consumption and burning the proceeds, and blockchain oracles.\nView full paper"

Its exact semantics nevertheless remain highly contested and ambiguous, with proponents and critics disagreeing widely on the level of decentralization offered. To address this, we put forth a systematization of the current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a methodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring decentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple layers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and enables a unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1) hardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics (\"tokenomics\"), (6) API, (7) governance, and (8) geography. Armed with this stratification, we examine for each layer which pertinent properties of distributed ledgers (safety, liveness, privacy, stability) can be at risk due to centralization and in what way. Our work highlights the challenges in measuring and achieving decentralization, points to the degree of (de)centralization of various existing systems, where such assessment can be made from presently available public information, and suggests potential metrics and directions where future research is needed. We also introduce the \"Minimum Decentralization Test\", as a way to assess the decentralization state of a blockchain system and, as an exemplary case, we showcase how it can be applied to Bitcoin.\nView full paper"

Next, we formalize interaction among scripts and stateful contracts via message-passing, consisting of a specification and an implementation of a stateful distributed message-passing contract, together with a proof of the integrity of its implementation. Messages specify sender and receiver outputs, as well as the data and assets being communicated, which are recorded on the ledger in the form of special NFT tokens distributed across UTxO entries that also contain the sent assets.\nWe give two applications of our design by considering a message: (1) as a record of a successful script computation, akin to memoization, and (2) as a mechanism for asynchronous structured contracts communication that enables a principled separation of contract communication from its computation. Building on this application of message-passing, we present a result stating that making payouts from stateful contracts using message-passing is not vulnerable to double satisfaction.\nView full paper"

In practice, systems tip to either full anonymity (e.g. Monero), or full utility (e.g. Bitcoin). Well-known cryptographic primitives for bridging this gap exist: anonymous credentials (AC) let users disclose a subset of their credentials' attributes, revealing to service providers \"just what they need\"; group signatures (GS) allow users to authenticate anonymously, to be de-anonymized \"just when deemed necessary\". However, these primitives are hard to deploy.\nCurrent AC and GS variants reach specific points in the privacy-utility tradeoff, which we point as counter-productive engineering-wise, as it requires full and error-prone re-engineering to adjust the tradeoff. Also, so far, GS and AC have been studied separately by theoretical research.\nWe take the first steps toward unifying and generalizing both domains, with the goal of bringing their benefits to practice, in a flexible way. We give a common model capturing their core properties, and use functional placeholders to subsume intermediate instantiations of the privacy-utility tradeoff under the same model. To prove its flexibility, we show how concrete variants of GS, AC (and others, like ring signatures) can be seen as special cases of our scheme to which we refer as universal anonymous signatures (UAS). In practice, this means that instantiations following our construction can be configured to behave as variant X of a GS scheme, or as variant Y of an AC scheme, by tweaking a few functions.\nView full paper"

In this work, we introduce the first threshold structure-preserving signature scheme (TSPS). This allows multiple parties to jointly sign a message, resulting in a standard, single-party SPS signature, and can thus be used as a replacement for applications based on SPS.\nWe begin by defining and constructing SPS for indexed messages, which are messages defined relative to a unique index. We prove its security in the random oracle model under a variant of the generalized Pointcheval-Sanders assumption (PS). Moreover, we generalize this scheme to an indexed multi-message SPS for signing vectors of indexed messages, which we prove secure under the same assumption. We then formally define the notion of a TSPS and propose a construction based on our indexed multi-message SPS. Our TSPS construction is fully non-interactive, meaning that signers simply output partial signatures without communicating with the other signers. Additionally, signatures are short: they consist of 2 group elements and require 2 pairing product equations to verify. We prove the security of our TSPS under the security of our indexed multi-message SPS scheme. Finally, we show that our TSPS may be used as a drop-in replacement for UC-secure Threshold-Issuance Anonymous Credential (TIAC) schemes, such as Coconut, without the overhead of the Fischlin transform.\nView full paper"

However, existing protocols such as DAG-rider (Keidar et al., PODC 2021) and Narwhal and Tusk (Danezis et al., Eurosys 2022) face two undesired practical issues: (1) high transaction latency and (2) high cost to verify transaction outcomes. To address (1), this work introduces a novel commit rule based on the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Data Model, which allows a node to predict the transaction results before triggering the commitment. We propose a new consensus algorithm named Board and Clerk , which reduces the transaction latency by half for roughly 50 of transactions according to our experiments. As the tolerance for faults escalates, more transactions can partake in this latency reduction. In addition, we also propose the HyperBlock Model with two flexible proposing strategies to tackle (2): blocking and non-blocking. Using our proposed strategies, each node first predicts the transaction results if its proposal is committed and packs this result as a commitment in its proposal. The hyper-block packs the proposal s signature, and the consensus layer outputs to prove the transaction results.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Partial Allocation in Budget-feasible Mechanism Design: Bridging Multiple Levels of Service and Divisible Agents\nDecember/2023, WINE 2023\nGAME-THEORY\nBudget-feasible procurement has been a major paradigm in mechanism design since its introduction by Singer [20]. An auctioneer (buyer) with a strict budget constraint is interested in buying goods or services from a group of strategic agents (sellers). In many scenarios it makes sense to allow the auctioneer to only partially buy what an agent offers, e.g., an agent might have multiple copies of an item to sell, they might offer multiple levels of a service, or they may be available to perform a task for any fraction of a specified time interval. Nevertheless, the focus of the related literature has been on settings where each agent s services are either fully acquired or not at all. The main reason for this, is that in settings with partial allocations like the ones mentioned, there are strong inapproximability results (see, e.g., Chan and Chen [9], Anari et al. [4]). Under the mild assumption of being able to afford each agent entirely, we are able to circumvent such results in this work. We design a polynomial-time, deterministic, truthful, budget-feasible (2+ 3)-approximation mechanism for the setting where each agent offers multiple levels of service and the auctioneer has a discrete separable concave valuation function. We then use this result to design a deterministic, truthful and budget-feasible mechanism for the setting where any fraction of a service can be acquired and the auctioneer s valuation function is separable concave (i.e., the sum of concave functions). The approximation ratio of this mechanism depends on how nice the concave functions are, and is O(1) for valuation functions that are sums of O(1)-regular functions (e.g., functions like log(1+ x)). For the special case of a linear valuation function, we improve the best known approximation ratio for the problem from 1 + (by Klumper and Sch fer [15]) to 2.\nView full paper"

Engagement here implies that the user will be asked to complete certain tasks, whenever she is selected to contribute, according to some stochastic process. Apart from the basic dilemma of engaging or not, even more strategic considerations arise in systems where users may be able to declare participation and then retract (while still being able to receive rewards). We propose two models for studying such games, with the first one focusing on the basic dilemma of engaging or not, whereas the latter focuses on the retraction effects. In both models we provide characterization results or necessary conditions on the structure of Nash equilibria. Our findings reveal that appropriate reward mechanisms can be used to stimulate participation and avoid negative effects of free riding, results that are in line with real world blockchain system deployments.\nView full paper"

Smart contracts are self-contained pieces of software that control (valuable) assets in an adversarial environment; once committed to the blockchain, these smart contracts cannot be modified. Smart contracts are typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to low-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain. For a smart contract user to trust a given piece of low-level code on the blockchain, they must convince themselves that (a) they are in possession of the matching source code and (b) that the compiler has correctly translated the source code to the given low-level code.\nClassic approaches to compiler correctness tackle the second point. We argue that translation certification also squarely addresses the first. We describe the proof architecture of a translation certification framework and demonstrate how we can model the compilation pipeline as a sequence of translation relations. We give a detailed account of such relations for most passes of the Plutus Tx compiler, which we formalised in Coq. This approach facilitates a modular verification methodology and is robust in the face of an evolving compiler implementation.\nView full paper"

We show that the commonly employed compilation strategy from polynomial interactive oracle proofs (PIOP) via polynomial commitments to knowledge sound SNARKS actually also achieves other desirable properties: weak unique response (WUR) and trapdoorless zero-knowledge (TLZK); and that together they imply simulation extractability (SIM-EXT).\nThe factoring of SIM-EXT into KS + WUR + TLZK is becoming a cornerstone of the analysis of non-malleable SNARK systems. We show how to prove WUR and TLZK for PIOP compiled SNARKs under mild falsifiable assumptions on the polynomial commitment scheme. This means that the analysis of knowledge soundness from PIOP properties that inherently relies on non-falsifiable or idealized assumption such as the algebraic group model (AGM) or generic group model (GGM) need not be repeated.\nWhile the proof of WUR requires only mild assumptions on the PIOP, TLZK is a different matter. As perfectly hiding polynomial commitments sometimes come at a substantial performance premium, SNARK designers prefer to employ deterministic commitments with some leakage. This results in the need for a stronger zero-knowledge property for the PIOP.\nThe modularity of our approach implies that any analysis improvements, e.g. in terms of tightness, credibility of the knowledge assumption and model of the KS analysis, or the precision of capturing real-world optimizations for TLZK also benefits the SIM-EXT guarantees.\nView full paper"

To instantiate our methodology we additionally prove that KZG commitments satisfy our simulation extractability requirement, despite being naturally malleable. To this end, we design a relaxed notion of simulation extractability that matches how KZG commitments are used and optimized in real-world prove systems.

The challenge is to select a committee of participants that accurately reflects the proportion of corrupt and honest parties, as measured by stake, in the full population. The trade-off between committee size and the probability of selecting a committee that over-represents the corrupt parties is a fundamental factor in both security and efficiency of proof-of-stake consensus, as well as committee-run layer-two protocols.\nWe propose and analyze several new committee selection schemes that improve upon existing techniques by adopting low-variance assignment of certain committee members that hold significant stake.

This cryptographic agility, as it has been called, is a fundamental desideratum for long term cryptographic system security that still poses significant challenges from a modeling perspective. For instance, current formulations of agility fail to express the fundamental security that is expected to stem from timely implementation updates, namely the fact that the system retains some of its security properties provided that the update is performed prior to the deprecated implementation becoming exploited.\nIn this work we put forth a novel framework for expressing updateability in the context of cryptographic primitives within the universal composition model. Our updatable ideal functionality framework provides a general template for expressing the security we expect from cryptographic agility capturing in a fine-grained manner all the properties that can be retained across implementation updates. We exemplify our framework over two basic cryptographic primitives, digital signatures and non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK), where we demonstrate how to achieve updateability with consistency and backwards-compatibility across updates in a composable manner.

An LP earns fee rewards proportional to the amount of its liquidity allocation when prices move in this interval. This induces the problem of strategic liquidity provision: smaller intervals result in higher concentration of liquidity and correspondingly larger fees when the price remains in the interval, but with higher risk as prices may exit the interval leaving the LP with no fee rewards. Although reallocating liquidity to new intervals can mitigate this loss, it comes at a cost, as LPs must expend gas fees to do so. We formalize the dynamic liquidity provision problem, and focus on a general class of strategies for which we provide a neural network-based optimization framework for maximizing LP earnings. We model a single LP that faces an exogenous sequence of price changes that arise from arbitrage and non-arbitrage trades in the decentralized exchange. We present experimental results informed by historical price data that demonstrate large improvements in LP earnings over existing allocation strategy baselines.

Namely, users evaluate meaningful computational problems, e.g., solving optimization problems, instead of computing numerous hash function values as in PoW. A recent approach utilizes the training process of deep learning as useful work . However, these works lack security analysis when deploying them with blockchain-based protocols, let alone the informal and over-complicated system design. This work proposes a distributed proof-of-deep-learning (D-PoDL) scheme concerning PoUW s requirements. With a novel hash-trainin g-hash structure and model-referencing mechanism, our scheme is the first deep learningbased PoUW scheme that enables achieving better accuracy distributively. Next, we introduce a transformation from the D-PoDL scheme to a generic D-PoDL blockchain protocol which can be instantiated with two chain selection rules, i.e., the longest-chain rule and the weight-based blockchain framework (LatinCrypt 21). This work is the first to provide formal proofs for deep learning-involved blockchain protocols concerning the robust ledger properties, i.e., chain growth, chain quality, and common prefix. Finally, we implement the D-PoDL scheme to discuss the effectiveness of our design.\nView full paper"

To this end, we employ a proportionality criterion suggested recently in the literature, that guarantees fair representation for all groups of voters of sufficient size. For this criterion, there exist rules that perform well in the case where all the issues have a binary domain and are independent of each other. In particular, this has been shown for Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and for the Method of Equal Shares (MES).\nIn this paper, we go two steps further: we generalize these guarantees for issues with a non-binary domain, and, most importantly, we consider extensions to elections with dependencies among issues, where we identify restrictions that lead to analogous results. To achieve this, we define appropriate generalizations of PAV and MES to handle conditional ballots. In addition to proportionality considerations, we also examine the computational properties of the conditional version of MES. Our findings indicate that the conditional case poses additional challenges and differs significantly from the unconditional one, both in terms of proportionality guarantees and computational complexity.\nView full paper"

An emblematic property of longest-chain consensus is that it provides probabilistic settlement guarantees that strengthen over time. This makes the exact relationship between settlement error and settlement latency a critical aspect of the protocol that both users and system designers must understand to make informed decisions. A recent line of work has finally provided a satisfactory rigorous accounting of this relationship for proof-of-work longest-chain protocols, but those techniques do not appear to carry over to the proof-of-stake setting.\nThis article develops explicit, rigorous settlement bounds for proof-of-stake longest-chain protocols, placing them on equal footing with their proof-of-work counterparts. Our techniques apply with some adaptations also to the proof-of-work setting where they provide improvements to the state-of-the-art settlement bounds for proof-of-work protocols.\nView full paper"

This need has been acknowledged by the wider community and new so-called Arithmetization-Oriented (AO) hash functions have been proposed, e.g. MiMC-Hash, Rescue-Prime, Poseidon, Reinforced Concrete and Griffin to name a few.\nIn this paper we propose Anemoi: a new family of ZK-friendly permutations, that can be used to construct efficient hash functions and compression functions. The main features of these algorithms are that 1) they are designed to be efficient within multiple proof systems (e.g. Groth16, Plonk, etc.), 2) they contain dedicated functions optimised for specific applications (namely Merkle tree hashing and general purpose hashing), 3) they have highly competitive performance e.g. about a factor of 2 improvement over Poseidon and Rescue-Prime in terms of R1CS constraints, a 21 -35 Plonk constraint reduction over a highly optimized Poseidon implementation, as well as competitive native performance, running between two and three times faster than Rescue-Prime, depending on the field size.\nOn the theoretical side, Anemoi pushes further the frontier in understanding the design principles that are truly entailed by arithmetization-orientation. In particular, we identify and exploit a previously unknown relationship between CCZ-equivalence and arithmetization-orientation. In addition, we propose two new standalone components that can be easily reused in new designs. One is a new S-box called Flystel, based on the well-studied butterfly structure, and the second is Jive -- a new mode of operation, inspired by the \"Latin dance\" symmetric algorithms (Salsa, ChaCha and derivatives). Our design is a conservative one: it uses a very classical Substitution-Permutation Network structure, and our detailed analysis of algebraic attacks highlights can be of independent interest.\nView full paper"

A key component for building such overlays is the peer-sampling service, a mechanism that continuously supplies each node with a set of up-to-date peers randomly selected across all alive nodes. Arguably, the most pernicious malicious action against such mechanisms is the provision of arbitrarily created links that point at malicious nodes. This paper proposes SecureCyclon, a peer-sampling protocol that deterministically eliminates the ability of malicious nodes to overrepresent themselves in Peer-to-Peer overlays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first protocol to offer this property, as previous works were able to only bound the proportion of excessive links to malicious nodes, without completely eliminating them. SecureCyclon redefines the concept of node descriptors from just being containers of information that enable communication with specific nodes, to being communication certificates that traverse the network and enable nodes to provably discover malicious nodes. We evaluate our solution with the conduction of extended simulations, and we demonstrate that it provides resilience even at the extreme condition of 40 malicious node participation.\nView full paper"

The problem becomes much harder in the presence of strategic agents. Ideally, one would want to design truthful mechanisms that produce allocations with fairness guarantees. However, in the standard setting without monetary transfers, it is generally impossible to have truthful mechanisms that provide non-trivial fairness guarantees. Recently, Amanatidis et al. [2021] suggested the study of mechanisms that produce fair allocations in their equilibria. Specifically, when the agents have additive valuation functions, the simple Round-Robin algorithm always has pure Nash equilibria and the corresponding allocations are envy-free up to one good (EF1) with respect to the agents' true valuation functions. Following this agenda, we show that this outstanding property of the Round-Robin mechanism extends much beyond the above default assumption of additivity. In particular, we prove that for agents with cancelable valuation functions (a natural class that contains, e.g., additive and budget-additive functions), this simple mechanism always has equilibria and even its approximate equilibria correspond to approximately EF1 allocations with respect to the agents' true valuation functions. Further, we show that the approximate EF1 fairness of approximate equilibria surprisingly holds for the important class of submodular valuation functions as well, even though exact equilibria fail to exist!\nView full paper"

This seems to be an unfair comparison since these networks do not complete a transaction from beginning to end. Rather they buy the risk and settle it much later. Typically transactions have only two players, the payer and the payee, and the settlement of this transaction requires time since it depends on basic properties of the consensus protocol. In practice, the payee, very often, needs to wait for confirmation in order to ship the traded goods. Alternatively, the payee, or merchant, can ship it in faith that the transaction will be confirmed. Our contribution, the Maraved Protocol, introduces a third player to minimize the risk of the payee to be left without the payment even without the consensus layer confirmation. The main idea is that the third player can work similarly to a credit card company. That is, it buys the risk from the merchant, by a small discount, and allows the third player to pay it instantaneously via a payment-channel like protocol. In parallel, the third player receives the regular payment transaction from the payer that can be settled on the chain, thus, after waiting the consensus/blockchain required time. Moreover, the on-chain transaction pays the full amount, allowing the third player to cash in the discount. Hence on the side of the merchant, our protocol puts forth instantaneous finality in a novel way to the best of our knowledge.\nView full paper"

The algorithm can tolerate a (1 )/2 fraction of the n players to be controlled by an adaptive adversary that may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol. The randomness mechanism relies on verifiable random functions (VRF), modeled as random functions, and effectively stretches an initial -bit seed to an arbitrarily long public sequence so that (i) with overwhelming probability in k--the security parameter--each beacon value has high min-entropy conditioned on the full history of the algorithm, and (ii) the total work and communication required per value is O(k) cryptographic operations.\nThe protocol can be directly applied to provide a qualitative improvement in the security of several proof-of-stake blockchain algorithms, rendering them safe from \"grinding'\" attacks.\nView full paper"

Timeliness, i.e., delivering results within the required time bounds, makes a major contribution to the predictability of performance. In this paper, we focus on timeliness using the Q Systems Development paradigm ( QSD, developed by PNSol), which computes timeliness by modelling systems observationally using so-called outcome expressions. An outcome expression is a compositional definition of a system s observed behaviour in terms of its basic operations. Given the stochastic behaviour of the basic operations, QSD efficiently computes the stochastic behaviour of the whole system including its timeliness.\nThis paper formally proves useful algebraic properties of outcome expressions w.r.t. timeliness: We prove the different algebraic structures the set of outcome expressions form with the different QSD operators and demonstrate why those operators do not form richer structures. We prove or disprove the set of all possible distributivity results on outcome expressions. We prove 14 equivalences that have been used in the past in the practice of QSD.\nAn immediate benefit is rewrite rules that can be used for design exploration under established timeliness equivalence. This work is part of an ongoing project to disseminate and build tool support for QSD. The ability to rewrite outcome expressions is essential for efficient tool support.\nView full paper"

This results in an ever increasing demand for transactions on blockchains, however, the amount of transactions per second on a given ledger is limited. Layer-2 systems attempt to improve scalability by taking transactions off-chain, with building blocks that are two party channels which are concatenated to form networks. Interaction between two parties requires (1) routing such a network, (2) interaction with and collateral from all intermediaries on the routed path and (3) interactions are often more limited compared to what can be done on the ledger. In contrast to that design, recent constructions such as Hydra Heads (FC 21) are both multi-party and isomorphic, allowing interactions to have the same expressiveness as on the ledger making it akin to a ledger located on Layer-2. The follow up Interhead Construction (MARBLE 22) further extends the protocol to connect Hydra Heads into networks by means of a virtual Hydra Head construction. This work puts forth an even greater generalization of the Interhead Protocol, allowing for interaction across different Layer-2 ledgers with a multitude of improvements. As concrete example, our design is modular and lightweight, which makes it viable for both full virtual ledger constructions as well as straightforward one-time interactions and payments systems.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Improved EFX Approximation Guarantees under Ordinal-based Assumptions\nMay/2023, AAMAS '23\nOur work studies the fair allocation of indivisible items to a set of agents, and falls within the scope of establishing improved approximation guarantees. It is well known by now that the classic solution concepts in fair division, such as envy-freeness and proportionality, fail to exist in the presence of indivisible items. Unfortunately, the lack of existence remains unresolved even for some relaxations of envy-freeness, and most notably for the notion of EFX, which has attracted significant attention in the relevant literature. This in turn has motivated the quest for approximation algorithms, resulting in the currently best known ( 1)-approximation guarantee by [5], where equals the golden ratio. So far, it has been notoriously hard to obtain any further advancements beyond this factor. Our main contribution is that we achieve better approximations, for certain special cases, where the agents agree on their perception of some items in terms of their worth. In particular, we first provide an algorithm with a 2/3-approximation, when the agents agree on what are the top items (but not necessarily on their exact ranking), with being the number of agents. To do so, we also propose a general framework that can be of independent interest for obtaining further guarantees. Secondly, we establish the existence of exact EFX allocations in a different scenario, where the agents view the items as split into tiers w.r.t. their value, and they agree on which items belong to each tier. Overall, our results provide evidence that improved guarantees can still be possible by exploiting ordinal information of the valuations.\nView full paper"

It is crypto-backed in the sense that the bank keeps a volatile cryptocurrency in its reserve. The reserve is used to buy stablecoins from users that want to sell them. And revenue from sales of stablecoins to users are stored in the reserve. Besides stablecoins, the bank also trades reservecoins in order to capitalize itself and maintain a reserve ratio significantly greater than one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stablecoin protocol where stability claims are precisely and mathematically stated and proven. Furthermore, the claims and their proofs are formally verified using two different techniques: bounded model checking, to exhaustively search for counter-examples to the claims; and interactive theorem proving, to build rigorous formal proofs using a proof assistant with automated theorem proving features.\nView full paper"

Here, we propose a privacy-preserving blueprint capability that allows an auditor to publish an encoding of the function f(x, ) for a publicly known function f and a secret input x. For example, x may be a secret watchlist, and f(x, y) may return y if y x. On input her data y and the auditor s pkA, a user can compute an escrow Z such that anyone can verify that Z was computed correctly from the user s credential attributes, and moreover, the auditor can recover f(x, y) from Z. Our contributions are:\nWe define secure f-blueprint systems; our definition is designed to provide a modular extension to anonymous credential systems.\nWe show that secure f-blueprint systems can be constructed for all functions f from fully homomorphic encryption and NIZK proof systems, or from non-interactive secure computation and NIZK. These results are of theoretical interest but is not efficient enough for practical use.\nWe realize an optimal blueprint system under the DDH assumption in the random-oracle model for the watchlist function.\nView full paper"

Application of zero knowledge techniques (Latus, Mina) allows for reaching high level security and general throughput, though it brings new challenges on keeping decentralization where significant effort is required for robust computation of zk-proofs. We consider a simultaneous decentralized creation of various zk-proof trees that form proof-trees sequences in sidechains in the model that combines behavior of provers, both deterministic (mutually consistent) or stochastic (independent) and types of proof trees. We define the concept of efficiency of such process, introduce its quantity measure and recommend parameters for tree creation. In deterministic cases, the sequences of published trees are ultimately periodic and ensure the highest possible efficiency (no collisions in proof creation). In stochastic cases, we obtain a universal measure of prover efficiencies given by the explicit formula in one case or calculated by a simulation model in another case. The optimal number of allowed provers positions for a step can be set for various sidechain parameters, such as number of provers, number of time steps within one block, etc. Benefits and restrictions for utilization of non-perfect binary proof trees are also explicitly presented.\nView full paper"

In this work, we propose a PFE scheme for RAM. In particular, we first design an efficient 4-server distributed ORAM scheme with amortized communication O(log n) per access (both reading and writing). We then simulate a RISC RAM machine over the MPC platform, hiding (i) the memory access pattern, (ii) the machine state (including registers, program counter, condition flag, etc.), and (iii) the executed instructions. Our scheme can naturally support a simplified TinyRAM instruction set; if a public RAM program P with given inputs x needs to execute z instruction cycles, our PFE scheme is able to securely evaluate P(x) on private P and x within 5z + 1 online rounds. We prototype and benchmark our system for set intersection, binary search, quicksort, and heapsort algorithms.

In this paper, we consider the notion of -well-supported Nash equilibrium, where [0, 1] corresponds to the approximation guarantee. Put simply, in an -well-supported equilibrium, every player chooses with positive probability actions that are within of the maximum achievable payoff, against the other player s strategy. Ever since the initial approximation guarantee of 2/3 for well-supported equilibria, which was established more than a decade ago, the progress on this problem has been extremely slow and incremental. Notably, the small improvements to 0.6608, and finally to 0.6528, were achieved by algorithms of growing complexity. Our main result is a simple and intuitive algorithm, that improves the approximation guarantee to 1/2. Our algorithm is based on linear programming and in particular on exploiting suitably defined zero-sum games that arise from the payoff matrices of the two players. As a byproduct, we show how to achieve the same approximation guarantee in a query-efficient way.\nView full paper"

The back up key , which is secret, can be used to issue a proof of ownership , i.e., only the real owner of this secret key can generate a single proof, which is based on the WOTS+ signature scheme. The authors of Sleeve proposed the formal technique for a single proof of ownership, and only informally outlined a construction to generalize it to multiple proofs. This work identifies that their proposed construction presents drawbacks, i.e., varying of signature size and signing/verifying computation complexity, limitation of linear construction, etc. Therefore we introduce WOTSwana, a generalization of Sleeve, which is, more concretely, a more general scheme, i.e. an extra security layer that generates multiple proofs of ownership, and put forth a thorough formalization of two constructions: (1) one given by a linear concatenation of numerous WOTS+ private/public keys, and (2) a construction based on tree like structure, i.e., an underneath Merkle tree whose leaves are WOTS+ private/public key pairs. Furthermore, we present the security analysis for multiple proofs of ownership, showcasing that this work addresses the early mentioned drawbacks of the original construction.

In contrast, light clients only store small amounts of blockchain-related data and rely on the mediation of full nodes when interacting with the ledger. A broader adoption of blockchains calls for protocols that make this interaction trustless.\nWe revisit the design of light-client blockchain protocols from the perspective of classical proof-system theory, and explain the role that proofs of sequential work (PoSWs) can play in it. To this end, we define a new primitive called succinct non-interactive argument of chain knowledge (SNACK), a non-interactive proof system that provides clear security guarantees to a verifier (a light client) even when interacting only with a single dishonest prover (a full node). We show how augmenting any blockchain with any graph-labeling PoSW (GL-PoSW) enables SNACK proofs for this blockchain. We also provide a unified and extended definition of GL-PoSWs covering all existing constructions, and describe two new variants. We then show how SNACKs can be used to construct light-client protocols, and highlight some deficiencies of existing designs, along with mitigations.

(SCN'20) by extending it to the realm of reputation and trust. At the best of our knowledge, it is the first to introduce reputation and trust to proof of stake systems. Namely, we show that their delegation framework can be repurposed to construct a trust layer over a proof of stake consensus protocol in addition to its original stake delegation application. Furthermore, we show that such extension yields a concrete reputation system satisfying the positive results of (1) Asharov et al. (Asiacrypt'13), therefore allowing the secure execution of multiparty protocols such as GMW (STOC' 87) and Damgard and Ishai (Crypto'05), and (2) Kleinrock et al. (Indocrypt'20), therefore allowing the construction of Reputation-fair Lottery and therefore Proof of Reputation. More concretely, our devised layer is used to construct a concrete reputation system based on arbitrary stake distribution. In this layer groups of users can freely \"assign their respective trust\" to members of a set of trustees, i.e., participants that offered themselves as receivers of such assignment. Furthermore, our work offers the advantage of providing a clear stake based criteria, verifiable in the ledger, and, therefore, naturally resistant to sybil attack, that the set of trustees indeed yields an honest majority. This setting provides a better situation than a simple assumption of honest majority, since it involves stake in a decentralized ledger, and the public verifiability of the reputation score via verification of the stake distribution.\nView full paper"

Unfortunately, the real-world implementations of peer-to-peer gossip-style networks used by blockchain protocols rely on a number of ad-hoc attack mitigation strategies that leave a glaring gap between the idealized communication layer assumed in formal security arguments for blockchains and the real world, where a wide array of attacks have been showcased.\nIn this work we bridge this gap by presenting a Byzantine-resilient network layer for blockchain protocols. For the first time we quantify the problem of network-layer attacks in the context of blockchain security models, and we develop a design that thwarts resource restricted adversaries. Importantly, we focus on the proof-of-stake setting due to its vulnerability to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks stemming from the well-known deficiency (compared to the proof-of-work setting) known as nothing at stake.\nWe present a Byzantine-resilient gossip protocol, and we analyze it in the Universal Composition framework. In order to prove security, we show novel results on expander properties of random graphs. Importantly, our gossip protocol can be based on any given bilateral functionality that determines a desired interaction between two \"adjacent\" peers in the networking layer and demonstrates how it is possible to use application-layer information to make the networking-layer resilient to attacks. Despite the seeming circularity, we demonstrate how to prove the security of a Nakamoto-style longest-chain protocol given our gossip networking functionality, and hence, we demonstrate constructively how it is possible to obtain provable security across protocol layers, given only bare-bone point-to-point networking, majority of honest stake, and a verifiable random function.\nView full paper"

While a long and fruitful line of work studying the provable security guarantees of this mechanism has succeeded to identify its exact security region---the set of parametrizations under which it possesses asymptotic security---the existing understanding falls short of providing practical settlement-time guarantees backed by this theory. This gap is most noticable for blockchains that are parametrized to maximize throughput by selecting block-creation time commesurate with network delays.\nIn this work we provide a new approach for obtaining such settlement-time guarantees. Our results give a rigorous framework for analyzing consistency that yields an efficient computational method for computing explicit bounds on settlement time as a function of honest and adversarial computational power and a bound on network delays. Our framework simultaneously provides upper and lower bounds on settlement times, which permits an immediate evaluation of the strength of the bounds. We implement this computational method and provide example results for several settings of interest. For Bitcoin, for example, the explicit upper and lower bounds are within 100 seconds of each other with 1 hour of settlement delay, 10 second networking delays, and a 20 adversary.\nView full paper"

The underlying assumption is that parties experience the passage of time with roughly the same speed, but however they may disengage and engage with the protocol following arbitrary (and even chosen adversarially) participation patterns. This (classical) problem has received renewed attention due to the advent of blockchain protocols, and recently it has been solved in the setting of proof of stake, i.e., when parties are assumed to have access to a trusted PKI setup [Badertscher et al., Eurocrypt 21].\nIn this work, we present the first proof-of-work (PoW)-based permissionless clock synchronization protocol. Our construction assumes a public setup (e.g., a CRS) and relies on an honest majority of computational power that, for the first time, is described in a fine-grain timing model that does not utilize a global clock that exports the current time to all parties. As a secondary result of independent interest, our protocol gives rise to the first PoW-based ledger consensus protocol that does not rely on an external clock for the time-stamping of transactions and adjustment of the PoW difficulty.\nView full paper"

On the one hand, it is desired they are private so that a financial \"panopticon\" is avoided, while on the other, they should be regulation friendly in the sense of facilitating any threshold-limiting, tracing, and counterparty auditing functionality that is necessary to comply with regulations such as Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT) as well as financial stability considerations. In this work, we put forth a new model for CBDCs and an efficient construction that, for the first time, fully addresses these issues simultaneously. Moreover, recognizing the importance of avoiding a single point of failure, our construction is distributed so that all its properties can withstand a suitably bounded minority of participating entities getting corrupted by an adversary. Achieving all the above properties efficiently is technically involved; among others, our construction uses suitable cryptographic tools to thwart man-in-the-middle attacks, it showcases a novel traceability mechanism with significant performance gains compared to previously known techniques and, perhaps surprisingly, shows how to obviate Byzantine agreement or broadcast from the optimistic execution path of a payment, something that results in an essentially optimal communication pattern and communication overhead when the sender and receiver are honest. Going beyond \"simple\" payments, we also discuss how our scheme can facilitate one-off large transfers complying with Know Your Transaction (KYT) disclosure requirements. Our CBDC concept is expressed and realized in the Universal Composition (UC) framework providing in this way a modular and secure way to embed it within a larger financial ecosystem.\nView full paper"

They are not primarily limited by the resources available to each node (network capacity or CPU performance), but by the nature of the data dependencies and communication dependencies within the distributed algorithm. Improving this requires a new algorithm design which is what Ouroboros Leios is intended to be.\nIn addition, a new design provides an opportunity to incorporate other useful modern features: tiered transaction fees with corresponding levels of service priority, and faster chain synchronisation by removing the need to execute every smart contract.\nThere are of course trade-offs in the design, in particular increased resource use and increased transaction latency, and these are discussed.\nThe new Ouroboros Leios design is not a small or modular extension however.

The security of such protocols relies fundamentally on the level of resources actively engaged in the system. The variety of different resources (and related proof protocols, some times referred to as PoX in the literature) raises the fundamental question whether it is possible to utilize many of them in tandem and build multi-resource consensus protocols. The challenge in combining different resources is to achieve fungibility between them, in the sense that security would hold as long as the cumulative adversarial power across all resources is bounded.\nIn this work, we put forth Minotaur, a multi-resource blockchain consensus protocol that combines proof of work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS), and we prove it optimally fungible. At the core of our design, Minotaur operates in epochs while continuously sampling the active computational power to provide a fair exchange between the two resources, work and stake. Further, we demonstrate the ability of Minotaur to handle a higher degree of work fluctuation as compared to the Bitcoin blockchain; we also generalize Minotaur to any number of resources.\nWe demonstrate the simplicity of Minotaur via implementing a full stack client in Rust (available open source). We use the client to test the robustness of Minotaur to variable mining power and combined work/stake attacks and demonstrate concrete empirical evidence towards the suitability of Minotaur to serve as the consensus layer of a real-world blockchain.\nView full paper"

With the introduction of Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are given the option to differentially allocate liquidity to be used for trades that occur within specific price intervals. In this paper, we formalize the profit and loss that liquidity providers can earn when providing specific liquidity positions to a contract. With this in hand, we are able to compute optimal liquidity allocations for liquidity providers who hold beliefs over how prices evolve over time. Ultimately, we use this tool to shed light on the design question regarding how v3 contracts should partition price space for permissible liquidity allocations.

The key promise is that incentive-driven participation of a large set of interested parties can lead to decentralized protocol states where no single operator can be a single point of failure. Despite this promise, there is little systematic analysis of decentralization in blockchain systems and the sporadic theoretic and empirical investigations that exist paint a rather negative picture due to resource pooling behaviors that are impossible to prevent in the permissionless setting of such protocols where parties have no designated identities.\nMotivated by this, in this paper we study the Nash dynamics of pooling in the context of Proof of Stake systems, following an agent-based modeling approach. Our focus is the Cardano blockchain as it features a number of attractive characteristics making it conducive to an in-depth analysis. We aim to answer the question of whether the incentive mechanism employed is capable of promoting decentralization. To this end, we present a simulation engine that enables strategic agents to engage in a number of actions empirically observed in the real-world deployment of the system. The engine simulates the stake pool operation and delegation game\" via successive agent actions that improve their utility as more information about their environment becomes evident in the course of the simulation. We investigate convergence to equilibrium states, and we measure various decentralization metrics in these states, such as the Nakamoto coefficient, which asks how many independent entities exist that collectively command more than of the system s resources. Our results exemplify the ability of the incentive mechanism to steer the system towards good equilibria and also illustrate how the decentralization features of such equilibria are affected by different choices of the parameters used in the mechanism and the distribution of stake to participants.\nView full paper"

The security of the transformation relies on rewinding to extract the secret key or the witness, even in the presence of signing queries for signatures and simulation queries for proof systems and SoK, respectively. We build on this line of work and analyze multi-round FS for arguments with a structured reference string (SRS). The combination of ROM and SRS, while redundant in theory, is the model of choice for the most efficient practical systems to date. We also consider the case where the SRS is updatable and define a strong simulation extractability notion that allows for simulated proofs with respect to an SRS to which the adversary can contribute updates.\nWe define three properties (trapdoor-less zero-knowledge, rewinding-based knowledge soundness, and a unique response property) that are sufficient for argument systems based on multi-round FS to be also simulation extractable in this strong sense. We show that Plonk, Sonic, and Marlin satisfy these properties, and conjecture that many other argument systems such as Lunar, Basilisk, and transparent variants of Plonk fall within the reach of our main theorem.\nView full paper"

This is attested by the fact that both of the two major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have undergone hard forks that resulted in the creation of alternative systems, creating confusion and opportunities for fraudulent activities. These events, and numerous others, underscore the importance of Blockchain governance, namely the set of processes that blockchain platforms utilize in order to perform decision-making and converge to a widely accepted direction for the system to evolve. While a rich topic of study in other areas, governance of blockchain platforms is lacking a well established set of methods and practices that are adopted industry wide. This makes the topic of blockchain governance a fertile domain for a thorough systematization that we undertake in this work.\nWe start by distilling a comprehensive array of properties for sound governance systems drawn from academic sources as well as grey literature of election systems and blockchain white papers. These are divided into seven categories, confidentiality, verifiability, accountability, sustainability, Pareto efficiency, suffrage and liveness that capture the whole spectrum of desiderata of governance systems. We proceed to classify ten well-documented blockchain systems. While all properties are satisfied, even partially, by at least one system, no system that satisfies most of them. Our work lays out a foundation for assessing blockchain governance processes. While it highlights shortcomings and deficiencies in currently deployed systems, it can also be a catalyst for improving these processes to the highest possible standard with appropriate trade-offs, something direly needed for blockchain platforms to operate effectively in the long term.\nView full paper"

As a result, there is an ongoing IRTF effort to standardize VRFs, with a proposed ECVRF based on elliptic-curve cryptography appearing as the most promising candidate.\nIn this work, towards understanding the general security of VRFs and in particular the ECVRF construction, we provide an ideal functionality in the Universal Composability (UC) framework (Canetti, FOCS 01) that captures VRF security, and show that ECVRF UC-realizes this functionality.\nWe further show how the range of a VRF can generically be extended in a modular fashion based on the above functionality. This observation is particularly useful for protocols such as Ouroboros since it allows to reduce the number of VRF evaluations (per slot) and VR verifications (per block) from two to one at the price of additional (but much faster) hash-function evaluations.\nFinally, we study batch verification in the context of VRFs.

Contrary to most existing voting approaches, we use the input of a set of motivated experts of varying levels of expertise. In particular, we develop an approval voting inspired selection mechanism through which the experts approve or disapprove the different updates according to their perception of the quality of each alternative. Given their opinions, and weighted by their expertise level, a single update is then implemented and evaluated, and the experts receive rewards based on their choices. We show that this mechanism always has approximate pure Nash equilibria and that these achieve a constant factor approximation with respect to the quality benchmark of the optimal alternative. Finally, we study the repeated version of the problem, where the weights of the experts are adjusted after each update, according to their performance. Under mild assumptions about the weights, the extension of our mechanism still has approximate pure Nash equilibria in this setting.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Correctness of Broadcast via Multicast: Graphically and Formally\nSeptember/2022, FROM '22\nMaintaining data consistency among multiple parties requires nodes to repeatedly send data to all other nodes. For example, the nodes of a blockchain network have to disseminate the blocks they create across the whole network. The scientific literature typically takes the ideal perspective that such data distribution is performed by broadcasting to all nodes directly, while in practice data is distributed by repeated multicast. Since correctness and security of consistency maintenance protocols usually have been established for the ideal setting only, it is vital to show that these properties carry over to real-world implementations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove that the ideal and the real behavior are equivalent.\nIn the work described in this paper, we take an important step towards such a proof by proving a simpler variant of this equivalence statement. The simplification is that we consider only a concrete pair of network topologies, which nevertheless illustrates important phenomena encountered with arbitrary topologies. For describing systems that distribute data, we use a domain-specific language of processes that corresponds to a class of Petri nets and is embedded in a general-purpose process calculus. This way, we can outline our proof using an intuitive graphical notation and leverage the rich theory of process calculi in the actual proof, which is machine-checked using the Isabelle proof assistant.\nView full paper"

The bloom of heterogeneous blockchain platforms brings a new emerging problem: typically, various blockchains are isolated systems, how to securely identify and/or transfer digital properties across blockchains? There are three main kinds of cross-chain approaches: sidechains/relays, notaries, and hashed time-lock contracts. Among them, notary-based cross-chain solutions have the best compatibility and user-friendliness, but they are typically centralized. To resolve this issue, we present Bool Network an open, distributed, secure cross-chain notary platform powered by MPC-based distributed key management over evolving hidden committees. More specifically, to protect the identities of the committee members, we propose a Ring verifiable random function ( Ring VRF ) protocol, where the real public key of a VRF instance can be hidden among a ring, which may be of independent interest to other cryptographic protocols. Furthermore, all the key management procedures are executed in the TEE, such as Intel SGX, to ensure the privacy and integrity of partial key components. A prototype of the proposed Bool Network is implemented in Rust language, using Polkadot Substrate.\nView full paper"

We introduce a formal model, within which one can assess whether the Nash dynamics can lead utility-maximizing participants to defect from the \"honest\" protocol operation, towards variations that exhibit one or more undesirable infractions, such as abstaining from participation and producing conflicting protocol histories. Blockchain protocols that do not lead to such infraction states are said to be compliant. Armed with this model, we evaluate the compliance of various Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol families, with respect to different utility functions and reward schemes, leading to the following results: i) PoS ledgers under resource-proportional rewards can be compliant if costs are negligible, but non-compliant if costs are significant; ii) PoW and PoS under block-proportional rewards exhibit different compliance behavior, depending on the lossiness of the network; iii) PoS ledgers can be compliant w.r.t. one infraction, i.e., producing conflicting messages, but non-compliant (and non-equilibria) w.r.t. abstaining or an attack we call selfish signing; iv) taking externalities, such as exchange rate fluctuations, into account, we quantify the benefit of economic penalties, in the context of PoS protocols, in disincentivizing particular infractions.\nView full paper"

We have formalized 3D rotations and generated a free group of 3D rotations of rank 2. In prior work, the non-denumerability of the reals was proved in ACL2(r), and a version of the Axiom of Choice that can consistently select a representative element from an equivalence class was introduced in ACL2 version 3.1. Using the free group of rotations, and this prior work, we show that the unit sphere can be decomposed into two sets, each equivalent to the original sphere. Then we show that the unit ball except for the origin can be decomposed into two sets each equivalent to the original ball by mapping the points of the unit ball to the points on the sphere. Finally, we handle the origin by rotating the unit ball around an axis such that the origin falls inside the sphere.

By combining insights and security properties from Zcash and SwapCT (PETS 21, an atomic swap system for Monero), we present a simple zk-SNARKs-based transaction scheme, called Zswap, which is carefully malleable to allow the merging of transactions, while preserving anonymity. Our protocol enables multiple assets and atomic exchanges by making use of sparse homomorphic commitments with aggregated open randomness, together with Zcash-friendly simulation-extractable non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs.

This distinctive feature is a new key generation mechanism, allowing users to generate a ''back up key'' securely nested inside the secret key of a signature scheme.\nUsing this novel construction, the ''back up key'', which is secret, can be used to generate a ''proof of ownership'', i.e., only the rightful owner of this secret key can generate such a proof. This design offers a quantum secure fallback, i.e., a brand new quantum resistant signature, ready to be used, nested in the ECDSA secret key. In this work, we rely on the original Sleeve definition to generalize the construction to a modular design based on Tweakable Hash Functions, thus yielding a cleaner design of the primitive.

This paper studies in particular PRNGs that are secure against premature next attacks (Kelsey et al., FSE '98), a class of attacks leveraging the fact that a PRNG may produce an output (which could be seen by an adversary!) before enough entropy has been accumulated. Practical designs adopt either unsound entropy-estimation methods to prevent such attacks (as in Linux's /dev/random) or sophisticated pool-based approaches as in Yarrow (MacOS/FreeBSD) and Fortuna (Windows).\nThe only prior theoretical study of premature next attacks (Dodis et al., Algorithmica '17) considers either a seeded setting or assumes a constant entropy rate, and thus falls short of providing and validating practical designs. Assuming the availability of random seed is particularly problematic, first because this requires us to somehow generate a random seed without using our PRNG, but also because we must ensure that the entropy inputs to the PRNG remain independent of the seed. Indeed, all practical designs are seedless. However, prior works on seedless PRNGs (Coretti et al., CRYPTO '19; Dodis et al., ITC '21, CRYPTO'21) do not consider premature next attacks.\nThe main goal of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of theoretically sound seedless PRNGs that are secure against premature next attacks. To this end, we make the following contributions:\n1. We prove that it is impossible to achieve seedless PRNGs that are secure against premature-next attacks, even in a rather weak model. Namely, the impossibility holds even when the entropic inputs to the PRNG are independent. In particular, our impossibility result holds in settings where seedless PRNGs are otherwise possible.\n2. Given the above impossibility result, we investigate whether existing seedless pool-based approaches meant to overcome premature next attacks in practical designs provide meaningful guarantees in certain settings. Specifically, we show the following.\n* We introduce a natural condition on the entropic input and prove that it implies security of the round-robin entropy accumulation PRNG used by Windows 10, called Fortuna. Intuitively, our condition requires the input entropy \"not to vary too wildly\" within a given round-robin round.\n* We prove that the \"root pool\" approach (also used in Windows 10) is secure for general entropy inputs, provided that the system's state is not compromised after system startup.\nView full paper"

However, these consensus protocols have inherent limitations thus resulting in scalability issues of the ledger. Layer-2 protocols operate on channels and allow parties to interact with another without going through the consensus protocol albeit relying on its security as fall-back. Prominent Layer-2 protocols are payment channels for Bitcoin that allow two parties to exchange coins, State Channels for Ethereum that allow two parties to execute a state machine, and Hydra heads [FC 21] for Cardano which allows multiple parties execution of Constraint Emitting Machines (CEM). Channels can be concatenated into networks using techniques such as Hashed Timelocked Contracts to execute payments or virtual state channels as introduced by Dziembowski et al. [CCS 18] to execute state machines. These constructions allow interaction between two parties across a channel network, i.e. the two endpoints of a path of channels. This is realized by utilizing intermediaries, which are the parties on the channel path which are in-between both endpoints, who have to pay collateral to ensure security of the constructions. While these approaches can be used with Hydra, they cannot be trivially extended to allow execution of CEMs between an arbitrary amount of parties across different Hydra heads. This work addresses this gap by introducing the Interhead construction that allows for the iterative creation of virtual Hydra heads. Of independent interest, our construction is the first that (1) supports channels with an arbitrary amount of parties and (2) allows for collateral to be paid by multiple intermediaries which allows to share this burden and thus improves practicality.\nView full paper"

In a nutshell, after performing an initial setup in which the hot wallet receives partial information of the cold wallet in order to hierarchically generate (transaction receiving) addresses, the cold wallet stays offline, whereas the hot wallet is kept online. The initial transferred information enables the hot wallet to generate receiving addresses for both wallets, but it can only spend its own funds, i.e., it cannot spend the funds in the cold wallet. This design conveniently mimics money storage in daily life: pocket money is kept in a less safe location, e.g., a regular wallet, while life savings are kept in a more safe environment, e.g., banking account. Note that the funds that land in offline addresses cannot be spent if the cold wallet is kept permanently offline. We propose a protocol and a technical solution to spend funds from a cold wallet without physically connecting it to any network. We designed and implemented a prototype for a system based on Optical Camera Communication (OCC) in a screen to camera setting, which can receive messages from a computer screen at the rate of over 150kB per second.

A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the propagation latency of blocks through the underlying peer-to-peer network, which is typically constructed by means of random connectivity. Disseminating blocks fast improves not only the transaction throughput, but also the security of the system as it reduces the probability of forks. In this paper we present CougaR: a simple yet efficient, eclipse-resistant, decentralized protocol that substantially reduces the block dissemination time in blockchain networks. CougaR's key advantages stem from its link selection policy, which combines a network latency criterion with randomness to offer fast and reliable block dissemination to the entire network. Moreover, CougaR is eclipse-resistant by design, as nodes are protected from having all their links directly or indirectly imposed on them by others, which is the typical vulnerability exploited to deploy eclipse attacks. We rigorously evaluate CougaR by an extensive set of experiments, both against a wide spectrum of parameter settings, and in comparison to the current state of the art.\nView full paper"

Furthermore, and quite importantly, transaction fees can only be paid in Ether.\nIn this paper, we focus on being able to pay transaction fees in custom currencies. We achieve this by way of a mechanism permitting short term liabilities to pay transaction fees in conjunction with offers of custom currencies to compensate for those liabilities. This enables block producers to accept custom currencies in exchange for settling liabilities of transactions that they process.\nWe present formal ledger rules to handle liabilities together with the concept of babel fees to pay transaction fees in custom currencies.

Smart contracts are self-contained pieces of software that control assets, which are often of high financial value, in an adversarial environment and, once committed to the blockchain, they cannot be changed anymore. Smart contracts are typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to low-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain. For a smart contract user to trust a given piece of low-level code on the blockchain, they must convince themselves that (a) they are in possession of the matching source code and (b) that the compiler faithfully translated the source code's semantics.\nClassic approaches to compiler correctness tackle the second point. We argue that translation certification also addresses the first. We describe the proof architecture of a novel translation certification framework, implemented in Coq, for a functional smart contract language. We demonstrate that we can model the compilation pipeline as a sequence of translation relations that facilitate a modular proof approach and are robust in the face of an evolving compiler implementation.\nView full paper"

We describe QSD, a novel metrics-based and quality-centric paradigm that uses formalised outcome diagrams to explore the performance consequences of design decisions, as a performance blueprint of the system. The distinctive feature of outcome diagrams is that they capture the essential observational properties of the system, independent of the details of system structure and behaviour. The QSD paradigm derives bounds on performance expressed as probability distributions encompassing all possible executions of the system. The QSD paradigm is both effective and generic: it allows values from various sources to be combined in a rigorous way so that approximate results can be obtained quickly and subsequently refined. QSD has been successfully used by a small team in Predictable Network Solutions for consultancy on large-scale applications in a number of industries, including telecommunications, avionics, and space and defence, resulting in cumulative savings worth billions of US dollars. The paper outlines the QSD paradigm, describes its formal underpinnings, and illustrates its use via a topical real-world example taken from the blockchain/cryptocurrency domain. QSD has supported the development of an industry-leading proof-of-stake blockchain implementation that reliably and consistently delivers blocks of up to 80 kB every 20 s on average across a globally distributed network of collaborating block-producing nodes operating on the public internet.\nView full paper"

Besides a direct, and optimal, SSPI for the basic single choice problem [Rubinstein et al., 2020], most existing SSPI results were obtained via an elegant, but inherently lossy, reduction to order-oblivious secretary (OOS) policies [Azar et al., 2014]. Motivated by this discrepancy, we develop an intuitive and versatile greedy-based technique that yields SSPIs directly rather than through the reduction to OOSs. Our results can be seen as generalizing and unifying a number of existing results in the area of prophet and secretary problems. Our algorithms significantly improve on the competitive guarantees for a number of interesting scenarios (including general matching with edge arrivals, bipartite matching with vertex arrivals, and certain matroids), and capture new settings (such as budget additive combinatorial auctions). Complementing our algorithmic results, we also consider mechanism design variants. Finally, we analyze the power and limitations of different SSPI approaches by providing a partial converse to the reduction from SSPI to OOS given by Azar et al.\nView full paper"

Such distributed proof generation, where recursive zk-SNARK-proofs are organized in perfect Mercle trees, was for the first time proposed in Latus consensus protocol for zk-SNARKs-based sidechains. We consider two models of a such proof generation process: the simplified one, where all proofs are independent (like one level of tree), and its natural generation, where proofs are organized in partially ordered set (poset), according to tree structure. Using discrete Markov chains for modeling of corresponding proof generation process, we obtained the recurrent formulas for the expectation and variance of the number of steps needed to generate a certain number of independent proofs by a given number of provers. We asymptotically represent the expectation as a function of the one variable n/m, where n is the number of provers m is the number of proofs (leaves of tree). Using results obtained, we give numerical recommendation about the number of transactions, which should be included in the current block, idepending on the network parameters, such as time slot duration, number of provers, time needed for proof generation, etc.\nView full paper"

A PCS scheme can be used in a setting where a central authority determines a global policy and distributes public and secret keys associated with sets of attributes to the users in the system. If two users, Alice and Bob, have attribute sets that jointly satisfy the global policy, Alice can use her secret key and Bob's public key to sign a message. Unforgeability ensures that a valid signature can only be produced if Alice's secret key is known and if the policy is satisfied. Privacy guarantees that the public keys and produced signatures reveal nothing about the users' attributes beyond whether they satisfy the policy or not. PCS extends the functionality provided by existing primitives such as attribute-based signatures and policy-based signatures, which do not consider a designated receiver and thus cannot include the receiver's attributes in the policies. We describe practical applications of PCS which include controlling transactions in financial systems with strong privacy guarantees (avoiding additional trusted entities that check compliance), as well as being a tool for trust negotiations.\nWe introduce an indistinguishability-based privacy notion for PCS and present a generic and modular scheme based on standard building blocks such as signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and a (predicate-only) predicate encryption scheme. We show that it can be instantiated to obtain an efficient scheme that is provably secure under standard pairing-assumptions for a wide range of policies. We further model PCS in UC by describing the goal of PCS as an enhanced ideal signature functionality which gives rise to a simulation-based privacy notion for PCS. We show that our generic scheme achieves this composable security notion under the additional assumption that the underlying predicate encryption scheme satisfies a stronger, fully adaptive, simulation-based attribute-hiding notion.\nView full paper"

A representative example is the Bitcoin ledger. Indeed, since Bitcoin---and more generally blockchain ledgers---are known to be useful in various scenarios, it has become increasingly popular to capture such ledgers as global setup. Intuitively, one would expect UC to allow us to make security statements about protocols that use such a global setup, e.g., a global ledger, which can then be automatically translated into the setting where the setup is replaced by a protocol implementing it, such as Bitcoin.\nWe show that the above reasoning is flawed and such a generic security-preserving replacement can only work under very (often unrealistic) strong conditions on the global setup and the security statement. For example, the UC security of Bitcoin for realizing a ledger proved by Badertscher et al. [CRYPTO'17] is not sufficient per se to allow us to replace the ledger by Bitcoin when used as a global setup. In particular, we cannot expect that all security statements in the global ledger-hybrid world would be preserved when using Bitcoin as a ledger.\nOn the positive side, we provide characterizations of security statements for protocols that make use of global setups, for which the replacement is sound. Our results can be seen as a first guide on how to navigate the very tricky question of what constitutes a \"good\" global setup and how to use it in order to keep the modular protocol-design approach intact.\nView full paper"

Its development is supported by several major secure-messaging providers (with a combined user base in the billions) and a growing body of academic research. MLS has evolved over many iterations to become a complex, non-trivial, yet relatively ad-hoc cryptographic protocol. In an effort to tame its complexity and build confidence in its security, past analyses of MLS have restricted themselves to sub-protocols of MLS most prominently a type of sub-protocol embodying so-called continuous group key agreement (CGKA). However, to date the task of proving or even defining the security of the full MLS protocol has been left open. In this work, we fill in this missing piece. First, we formally capture the security of SGM protocols by defining a corresponding security game, which is parametrized by a safety predicate that characterizes the exact level of security achieved by a construction. Then, we cast MLS as an SGM protocol, showing how to modularly build it from the following three main components (and some additional standard cryptographic primitives) in a black-box fashion: (a) CGKA, (b) forward-secure group AEAD (FS-GAEAD), which is a new primitive and roughly corresponds to an epoch of group messaging, and (c) a so-called PRF-PRNG, which is a two-input hash function that is a pseudorandom function (resp. generator with input) in its first (resp. second) input. Crucially, the security predicate for the SGM security of MLS can be expressed purely as a function of the security predicates of the underlying primitives, which allows to swap out any of the components and immediately obtain a security statement for the resulting SGM construction. Furthermore, we provide instantiations of all component primitives, in particular of CGKA with MLS s TreeKEM sub-protocol (which we prove adaptively secure) and of FS-GAEAD with a novel construction (which has already been adopted by MLS). Along the way we introduce a collection of new techniques, primitives, and results with applications to other SGM protocols and beyond. For example, we extend the Generalized Selective Decryption proof technique (which is central in CGKA literature) and prove adaptive security for another (practical) more secure CGKA protocol called RTreeKEM (Alwen et al., CRYPTO 20). The modularity of our approach immediately yields a corollary characterizing the security of an SGM construction using RTreeKEM.\nView full paper"

Towards long-term blockchain scalability, both of these must be pruned. While a large body of literature has explored the pruning of application data (UTXOs, account balances, and contract state), little has been said about the permanent pruning of consensus data (block headers). We present a protocol which allows pruning the blockchain by garbage collecting old blocks as they become unnecessary. These blocks can simply be discarded and are no longer stored by any miner. We show that all miners can be light miners with no harm to security. Our protocol is based on the notion of superblocks, blocks that have achieved an unusually high difficulty. We leverage them to represent underlying proof-of-work without ever illustrating it, storing it, or transmitting it. After our pruning is applied, the storage and communication requirements for consensus data is reduced exponentially.\nWe develop new probabilistic mathematical methods to analyze our protocol in the random oracle model. We prove our protocol is both secure and succinct under an uninterrupted honest majority assumption for 1/3 adversaries. Our protocol is the first to achieve always secure, always succinct, and online Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work, all necessary components for a logarithmic space mining scheme.

The appeal of this notion is that it provides a general template that an application can suitably instantiate by choosing a specific relation. Nonetheless, several important applications have been brought to light, including proofs-of-ownership of files or two-factor authentication, which do not fit the PoK template but naturally appear to be special cases of a more general notion of proofs of knowledge or possession. One would thus expect that their security properties, in particular privacy and soundness, are simply derived as concrete instantiation of a common generalized PoK concept with well understood security semantics. Unfortunately, such a notion does not exist, resulting in a variety of tailor-made security definitions whose plausibility must be checked on a case-by-case basis.\nIn this work, we close this gap by providing the theoretical foundations of a generalized notion of PoK that encompasses dynamic and setup-dependent relations as well as interactive statement derivations. This novel combination enables an application to directly specify relations that depend on an assumed setup, such as a random oracle, a database or ledger, and to have statements be agreed upon interactively and dynamically between parties based on the state of the setup. Our new notion is called agree-and-prove and provides clear semantics of correctness, soundness, and zero-knowledge in the above generalized scenario.\nAs an application, we first consider proofs-of-ownership of files for client-side file deduplication. We cast the problem and some of its prominent schemes in our agree-and-prove framework and formally analyze their security. Leveraging our generic zero-knowledge formalization, we then devise a novel scheme that is provably the privacy-preserving analogue of the well-known Merkle-Tree based protocol. As a second application, we consider two-factor entity authentication to showcase how the agree-and-prove notion encompasses proofs of ability, such as proving the correct usage of an abstract hardware token.\nView full paper"

The problem has long been a prominent goal for fault-tolerant distributed computing with a number of ingenious solutions in various settings. However, despite intensive investigation, the existing solutions do not apply to common blockchain protocols, which are designed to tolerate variable---and potentially adversarial---participation patterns, e.g., sleepiness and dynamic availability. Furthermore, because such blockchain protocols rely on freshly joining (or re-joining) parties to have a common notion of time, e.g., a global clock which allows knowledge of the current protocol round, it is not clear if or how they can operate without such a strong synchrony assumption.\nIn this work, we show how to solve the global synchronization problem by leveraging proof of stake (PoS). Concretely, we design and analyze a PoS blockchain protocol in the above dynamic-participation setting, that does not require a global clock but merely assumes that parties have local clocks advancing at approximately the same speed. Central to our construction is a novel synchronization mechanism that can be thought as the blockchain-era analogue of classical synchronizers: It enables joining parties---even if upon joining their local time is off by an arbitrary amount---to quickly calibrate their local clocks so that they all show approximately the same time. As a direct implication of our blockchain construction---since the blockchain can be joined and observed by any interested party---we obtain a permissionless PoS implementation of a global clock that may be used by higher level protocols that need access to global time.\nView full paper"

However, stake pools tend to increase centralization, since they are typically managed by a single party that acts on behalf of the pool s members.

We formalize Conclave as an ideal functionality and implement it as a distributed protocol, based on standard cryptographic primitives.

Unfortunately, none of them can be deployed to existing blockchains, as they require consensus changes and at least a soft fork to implement. In this paper, we investigate how a blockchain can be upgraded to support superblock clients without a soft fork. We show that it is possible to implement the needed changes without modifying the consensus protocol and by requiring only a minority of miners to upgrade, a process termed a velvet fork in the literature. While previous work conjectured that superblock clients can be safely deployed using velvet forks as-is, we show that previous constructions are insecure, and that using velvet techniques to interlink a blockchain can pose insidious security risks. We describe a novel class of attacks, called chain-sewing , which arise in the velvet fork setting: an adversary can cut-and-paste portions of various chains from independent temporary forks, sewing them together to fool a superlight client into accepting a false claim. We show how previous velvet fork constructions can be attacked via chain-sewing. Next, we put forth the first provably secure velvet superblock client construction which we show secure against adversaries that are bounded by 1/3 of the upgraded honest miner population. Like non-velvet superlight clients, our approach allows proving generic predicates about chains using infix proofs and as such can be adopted in practice for fast synchronization of transactions and accounts.\nView full paper"

The protocol will incur some cost to run while in the end (or at regular intervals), it will populate and update local tables that assign (virtual) rewards to participants. Each participant aspires to offset the costs of participation by these virtual payoffs that are provided in the course of the protocol. In this setting, we introduce and study a notion of coalition-safe equilibrium. In particular, we consider a strategic coalition of participants that is centrally coordinated and potentially deviates from with the objective to increase its utility with respect to the view of at least one of the other participants. The protocol is called a coalition-safe equilibrium with virtual payoffs (EVP) if no such protocol deviation exists. We apply our notion to study incentives in blockchain protocols. Compared to prior work, our framework has the advantages that it simultaneously (i) takes into account that each participant may have a divergent view of the rewards given to the other participants, as the reward mechanism employed is subject to consensus among players (and our notion is well defined independently of whether the underlying protocol achieves consensus or not) (ii) accounts for the stochastic nature of these protocols enforcing the equilibrium condition to hold with overwhelming probability (iii) provides a versatile way to describe a wide variety of utility functions that are based on rewards recorded in the ledger and cost incurred during ledger maintenance. We proceed to use our framework to provide a unified picture of incentives in the Bitcoin blockchain, for absolute and relative rewards based utility functions, as well as prove novel results regarding incentives of the Fruitchain blockchain protocol [PODC 2017] showing that the equilibrium condition holds for collusions up to n 1 players for absolute rewards based utility functions and less than n/2 for relative rewards based utility functions, with the latter result holding for any weakly fair blockchain protocol, a new property that we introduce and may be of independent interest.\nView full paper"

A stake-pool operates a node that engages in the PoS protocol and potentially represents a large number of smaller stakeholders. While such pooled PoS operation is attractive from various angles, it also exhibits a significant shortcoming that, so far and to the best of our knowledge, has not been sufficiently understood or investigated. Pooled PoS operation, to be effective and not lead to sub-optimal dictatorial or cartel-like configurations, should enable the stakeholders to revoke and re-delegate their stake in a way that is aligned with their incentives. However, given that stake-pool operators are exactly those entities who determine what transactions are to be recorded in the ledger, they are quite likely to form a cartel and censor any transaction they want, such as those that attempt to adjust the current stake-pool lineup. In this way, a power grab takes place, where the stake-pool cartel perpetuates its control over the PoS system. We first model and observe formally the emergence of the above problem in pooled PoS systems, and then we describe an anti-censorship mechanism that takes advantage of the underlying cryptographic functions of the ledger and the nature of peer-to-peer networks to diffuse information without suppression. We provide a thorough game-theoretic analysis of this mechanism discovering various types of Nash equilibria which demonstrate that the \"revolution\", i.e., the strategic decision of pool members to withdraw support from a censoring cartel as well as the pool operators to step down, can be incentivized, under suitable and plausible conditions in the utility functions of the involved participants.\nView full paper"

The current gold standards of composable security, the Universal Composability and Constructive Cryptography frameworks cannot capture knowledge assumptions, as their core proofs of composition prohibit white-box extraction. In this paper, we present a formal model allowing the composition of knowledge assumptions.

In this work we utilize the recently proposed blockchain adaptation of the rational protocol design (RPD) framework [EUROCRYPT '18] to analyze 51 double-spending attacks against Nakamoto-style proof-of-work based cryptocurrencies. We first observe a property of the originally proposed utility class that yields an unnatural conclusion against such attacks, and show how to devise a utility that avoids this pitfall and makes predictions that match the observable behavior---i.e., that renders attacking a dominant strategy in settings where an attack was indeed observed in reality. We then propose a generic remedy to the underlying protocol parameters that provably deter adversaries controlling a majority of the system's resources from attacks on blockchain consistency, including the 51 double-spending attack. This can be used as guidance to patch systems that have suffered such attacks, e.g., Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash, and serves as a demonstration of the power of game-theoretic analyses.\nView full paper"

A Hidden Secure Fallback for Cryptocurrency Wallets\nJune/2021, ACNS '21\nDIGITAL SIGNATURESHASH\nWe introduce a new key generation mechanism where users can generate a \"back up key\", securely nested inside the secret key of a signature scheme. Our main motivation is that in case of leakage of the secret key, established techniques based on zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are void since the key becomes public. On the other hand, the \"back up key\", which is secret, can be used to generate a \"proof of ownership\", i.e., only the real owner of this secret key can generate such a proof. To the best of our knowledge, this extra level of security is novel, and could have already been used in practice, if available, in digital wallets for cryptocurrencies that suffered massive leakage of account private keys. In this work, we formalize the notion of \"Proof of Ownership\" and \"Fallback\" as new properties. Then, we introduce our construction, which is compatible with major designs for wallets based on ECDSA, and adds a W-OTS+ signing key as a \"back up key\". Thus offering a quantum secure fallback. This design allows the hiding of any quantum secure signature key pair, and is not exclusive to W-OTS+.

Also, for the first time, it was shown that probability of such attack depends on the value equal to the product of the block propagation time and of the block generation intensity.

Several systems satisfying various definitions of privacy and requiring various trust assumptions have been proposed; however, none achieved the universality and uniformity that Ethereum achieved for non-private contracts: One unified method to construct most contracts. We provide a unified security model for private smart contracts which is based on the Universal Composition (UC) model and propose a novel core protocol, Kachina, for deploying privacy-preserving smart contracts, which encompasses previous systems.

Standard notions of security for FE deal with a malicious Bob and how the confidentiality of Alice's messages can be maintained taking into account the leakage that occurs due to the functional keys that are revealed to the adversary via various forms of indistinguishability experiments that correspond to IND-CPA, IND-CCA and simulation-based security. In this work we provide a complete and systematic investigation of Consistency, a natural security property for FE, that deals with attacks that can be mounted by Alice, Charlie or a collusion of the two against Bob. We develop three main types of consistency notions according to which set of parties is corrupted and investigate their relation to the standard security properties of FE.\nWe then provide explicit constructions that achieve consistency either directly via a construction based on MDDH for specific function classes of inner products over a modulo group or generically for all the consistency types via compilers using standard cryptographic tools. Finally, we put forth a universally composable treatment of FE and we show that our consistency notions naturally complement FE security by proving how they imply (and are implied by) UC security depending on which set of parties is corrupted thereby yielding a complete characterization of consistency for FE.\nView full paper"

As these are complex systems, it is essential to formally capture the exact security achieved by protocols employing TEEs, and ultimately, prove their security under composition, as TEEs are typically employed in multiple protocols, simultaneously.\nOur contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we show that under existing definitions of attested execution setup, we can realise cryptographic functionalities that are unrealisable in the standard model. On the other hand, we extend the adversarial model to capture a broader class of realistic adversaries, we demonstrate weaknesses of existing security definitions this class, and we propose stronger ones.\nSpecifically, we first define a generalization of Functional Encryption that captures Stateful and Randomised functionalities (FESR). Then, assuming the ideal functionality for attested execution of Pass et al. (Eurocrypt 2017), we construct the associated protocol, Steel, and we prove that Steel realises FESR in the universal composition with global subroutines model by Badertscher et al. (TCC 2020). Our work is also a validation of the compositionality of the Iron protocol by Fisch et al. (CCS 2017), capturing (non-stateful) hardware-based functional encryption.\nAs the existing functionality for attested execution of Pass et al. is too strong for real world use, we propose a weaker functionality that allows the adversary to conduct rollback and forking attacks. We demonstrate that Steel (realising stateful functionalities), contrary to the stateless variant corresponding to Iron, is not secure in this setting and discuss possible mitigation techniques.\nView full paper"

During these periods an attacker can mount devastating attacks, such as double spending or censorship of transactions. Checkpointing has been proposed as a mechanism to mitigate such 51 attacks. The core idea is to employ an external set of parties that securely run an assisting service which guarantees the ledger's properties and can be relied upon at times when the invested hashing power is low. We realize the assisting service in two ways, via checkpointing and timestamping, and show that a ledger, which employs either, is secure with high probability, even in the presence of an adversarial mining majority. We put forth the first rigorous study of checkpointing as a mechanism to protect PoW ledgers from 51 attacks. Notably, our design is the first to offer both consistency and liveness guarantees, even under adversarial mining majorities. Our liveness analysis also identifies a previously undocumented attack, namely front-running, which enables Denial-of-Service against existing checkpointed ledger systems. We showcase the liveness guarantees of our mechanism by evaluating the checkpointed version of Ethereum Classic, a blockchain which recently suffered a 51 attack, and build a federated distributed checkpointing service, which provides high assurance with low performance requirements. Finally, we prove the security of our timestamping mechanism, build a fully decentralized timestamping solution, by utilizing a secure distributed ledger, and evaluate its performance on the existing Bitcoin and Ethereum systems.\nView full paper"

As with any payment scheme, it is imperative to study issues of incentive compatibility of miners within the pool. For PPLNS this question has only been partially answered; we know that reasonably-sized miners within a PPLNS pool prefer following the pool protocol over employing specific deviations. In this paper, we present a novel modification to PPLNS where we randomise the protocol in a natural way. We call our protocol Randomised pay-per-last-N-shares (RPPLNS), and note that the randomised structure of the protocol greatly simplifies the study of its incentive compatibility. We show that RPPLNS maintains the strengths of PPLNS (i.e., fairness, variance reduction, and resistance to pool hopping), while also being robust against a richer class of strategic mining than what has been shown for PPLNS.\nView full paper"

A proof-of-work scheme involves two kinds of participants, provers and verifiers. Provers intend to solve a puzzle with a solution, while verifiers are in charge of checking the puzzle s correctness and solution pair. The widely adopted hash-based construction achieves an optimal gap in computational complexity between provers and verifiers. However, in industry, proof-of-work is done by highly dedicated hardware, e.g., ASIC , which is not generally accessible, let alone the high energy consumption rates. In this work, we turn our eyes back on the original meaning of proof of work . Under a trusted setting, our proposed framework and its constructions are based on computationally hard problems and the unified definition of hard cryptographic primitives by Biryukov and Perrin (Asiacrypt 17).

With the appearance of distributed ledgers or blockchains, numerous protocols have emerged, which attempt to achieve trustless communication between distrusting ledgers and participants. Cross-chain communication (CCC) thereby plays a fundamental role in cryptocurrency exchanges, sharding, bootstrapping of new and feature-extension of existing distributed ledgers. Unfortunately, existing proposals are designed ad-hoc for specific use-cases, making it hard to gain confidence on their correctness and composability.\nWe provide the first systematic exposition of protocols for CCC. First, we formalize the underlying research problem and show that CCC is impossible without a trusted third party, contrary to common beliefs in the blockchain community. We then develop a framework to evaluate existing and to design new cross-chain protocols. The framework is based on the use case, the trust model, and the security assumptions of interlinked blockchains. Finally, we identify security and privacy challenges faced by protocols in the cross-chain setting.\nThis Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) offers a comprehensive guide for designing protocols bridging the numerous distributed ledgers available today. It aims to facilitate clearer communication between academia and industry in the field.\nView full paper"

Bribing and other related attacks, such as front-running or Goldfinger attacks, aim to directly influence the incentives of actors within (or outside) of the targeted cryptocurrency system. The theoretical feasibility of bribing attacks on cryptocurrencies was first highlighted in 2016 by Bonneau, with various different techniques and approaches having since been proposed. Some of these attacks are designed to gain in-band profits, while others intend to break the mechanism design and render the cryptocurrency worthless. In this paper, we systematically expose the large but scattered body of research in this area which has accumulated over the years. We summarize these bribing attacks and similar techniques that leverage on programmatic execution and verification under the term algorithmic incentive manipulation (AIM) attacks, and show that the problem space is not yet fully explored. Based on our analysis we present several research gaps and opportunities that warrant further investigation. In particular, we highlight no- and near-fork attacks as a powerful, yet largely underestimated, AIM category that raises serious security concerns not only for smart contract platforms.\nView full paper"

At the same time, the rapid development in quantum computing makes the threats to cryptography more and more concerning. In this work, we revisit the formal security of the core of the Bitcoin consensus protocol, called the Bitcoin backbone (Eurocrypt 2015), in the presence of quantum adversaries -- i.e. adversaries equipped with quantum computers.\nWe show that the security of the Bitcoin backbone holds under a quantum analogue of the \"honest majority\" assumption that we develop. The critical ingredient of proving security of the blockchain is to analyze the quantum query complexity of a Chain-of-Proofs-of-Work search problem. This problem in turn reduces to a problem we call multi-solution Bernoulli search, for which we establish its quantum query complexity. This can be viewed as an extension of a threshold direct product theorem to an average-case unstructured search problem. Our proof, adding to active recent efforts, simplifies and generalizes the powerful recording technique due to Zhandry (Crypto 2019).\nOur analysis indicates that the security of the Bitcoin backbone protocol is guaranteed provided that the number of adversarial quantum queries is bounded so that each quantum query is worth O(p 1/2) classical ones, where p is the probability of success of a single classical query to the protocol's underlying hash function. Perhaps surprisingly, the wait time for safe settlement of transactions in the case of quantum adversaries matches (up to a constant) the safe settlement time in the classical case and thus does not result in any further overhead.\nView full paper"

Such protocols incur delays which severely limit the throughput of such ledgers. Payment and state channels enable execution of offchain protocols that allow interaction between parties without involving the consensus protocol. Protocols such as Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) and Sprites (FC 19) connect channels into Payment Channel Networks (PCN) allowing payments across a path of payment channels. Such a payment requires each party to lock away funds for an amount of time. The product of funds and locktime is the collateral of the party, i.e., their cost of opportunity to forward a payment. In the case of HTLC, the locktime is linear to the length of the path, making the total collateral invested across the path quadratic in size of its length. Sprites improved on this by reducing the locktime to a constant by utilizing smart contracts. Atomic Multi-Channel Updates (AMCU), published at CCS 19, introduced constant collateral payments without smart contracts. In this work we present the Channel Closure attack on AMCU that allows a malicious adversary to make honest parties lose funds. Furthermore, we propose the Payment Trees protocol that allows payments across a PCN with linear total collateral without the aid of smart contracts. A competitive performance similar to Sprites, and yet compatible to Bitcoin.\nView full paper"

In this paper we extend the attack landscape by presenting a method, which we call Pay-To-Win (P2W), that is capable of facilitating trustless double-spend collusion across different blockchains. Moreover, our technique can also be used to specifically incentivize transaction exclusion or (re)ordering. Attacks using our approach are operated and financed out-of-band i.e., on a funding cryptocurrency, while the consequences are induced in a different target cryptocurrency. We describe a concrete instantiation of our P2W attack which is able to fund double-spending attacks accross different blockchains. For this, we choose Bitcoin as a target and Ethereum as a funding cryptocurrency. Our P2W attack is designed in a way that reimburses collaborators even in the case of an unsuccessful attack. Interestingly, this actually renders our approach approximately one order of magnitude cheaper than comparable bribing techniques (e.g., the whale attack). We demonstrate the technical feasibility of P2W attacks through publishing all artifacts of this paper, ranging from calculations for figures and tables to a fully functional implementation of our most powerful out-of-band attack, consisting of an Ethereum smart contract and a Python client.\nView full paper"

Nevertheless, existing schemes are not suitable for the case where a server is given multiple instances of a puzzle scheme at once and it must unlock them at different points in time. If the schemes are naively used in this setting, then the server has to start solving all puzzles as soon as it receives them, that ultimately imposes significant computation cost and demands a high level of parallelisation. We put forth and formally define a primitive called multi-instance time-lock puzzle which allows composing a puzzle s instances. We propose a candidate construction: chained time-lock puzzle (C-TLP). It allows the server, given instances composition, to solve puzzles sequentially, without having to run parallel computations on them. C-TLP makes black-box use of a standard time-lock puzzle scheme and is accompanied by a lightweight publicly verifiable algorithm. It is the first time-lock puzzle that offers a combination of the above features. We use C-TLP to build the first outsourced proofs of retrievability that can support real-time detection and fair payment while having lower overhead than the state of the art. As another application of C-TLP, we illustrate in certain cases, one can substitute a verifiabledelay function with C-TLP, to gain much better efficiency.\nView full paper"

Many commonly used SNARK systems rely on a structured reference string, the secure generation of which turns out to be their Achilles heel: If the randomness used for the generation is known, the soundness of the proof system can be broken with devastating consequences for the underlying blockchain system that utilises them. In this work we describe and analyze, for the first time, a blockchain mechanism that produces a secure SRS with the characteristic that security is shown for the exact same conditions under which the blockchain protocol is proven to be secure. Our mechanism makes use of the recent discovery of updateable structure reference strings to perform this secure generation in a fully distributed manner. In this way, the SRS emanates from the normal operation of the blockchain protocol itself without the need of additional security assumptions or off-chain computation and/or verification. We provide concrete guidelines for the parameterisation of this system which allows for the completion of a secure setup in a reasonable period of time. We also provide an incentive scheme that, when paired with the update mechanism, properly incentivises participants into contributing to secure reference string generation.\nView full paper"

They offer optimistic offchain settlement of payments and expedient offchain evolution of smart contracts between multiple parties without imposing any additional assumptions beyond those of the underlying blockchain. In the case of disputes, or if a party fails to respond, cryptographic evidence collected in the offchain channel is used to settle the last confirmed state onchain, such that in-progress contracts can be continued under mainchain consensus.\nA serious disadvantage present in current layer-two state channel protocols is that existing layer-one smart contract infrastructure and contract code cannot be reused offchain without change.\nIn this paper, we introduce Hydra, an isomorphic multi-party state channel. Hydra simplifies offchain protocol and smart contract development by directly adopting the layer-one smart contract system, in this way allowing the same code to be used both on- and offchain. Taking advantage of the extended UTxO model, we develop a fast off-chain protocol for evolution of Hydra heads (our isomorphic state channels) that has smaller round complexity than all previous proposals and enables the state channel processing to advance on-demand, concurrently and asynchronously.\nWe establish strong security properties for the protocol, and we present and evaluate extensive simulation results that demonstrate that Hydra approaches the physical limits of the network in terms of transaction confirmation time and throughput while keeping storage requirements at the lowest possible.

The continuously increasing size of this shared state will gradually render its maintenance unaffordable. Our work investigates techniques that minimize the shared state of the distributed ledger, i.e., the in-memory UTxO set. To this end, we follow two directions: a) we propose novel transaction optimization techniques to be followed by wallets, so as to create transactions that reduce the shared state cost and b) propose a novel fee scheme that incentivizes the creation of state-friendly transactions. We devise an abstract ledger model, expressed via a series of algebraic operators, and define the transaction optimization problem of minimizing the shared state; we also propose a multi-layered algorithm that approximates the optimal solution to this problem. Finally, we define the necessary conditions such that a ledger s fee scheme incentivizes proper state management and propose a state efficient fee function for Bitcoin.\nView full paper"

Current proposals, however, require synchrony assumptions to preserve the safety of a channel, leaking to an adversary the exact amount of time needed to control the network for a successful attack. In this paper, we introduce Brick, the first payment channel that remains secure under network asynchrony and concurrently provides correct incentives. The core idea is to incorporate the conflict resolution process within the channel by introducing a rational committee of external parties, called wardens. Hence, if a party wants to close a channel unilaterally, it can only get the committee s approval for the last valid state.\nAdditionally, Brick provides sub-second latency because it does not employ heavy-weight consensus. Instead, Brick uses consistent broadcast to announce updates and close the channel, a light-weight abstraction that is powerful enough to preserve safety and liveness to any rational parties. We formally define and prove for Brick the properties a payment channel construction should fulfill. We also design incentives for Brick such that honest and rational behavior aligns.

Simulation Extractability (SE) is a necessary security property for a NIZK argument to achieve Universal Composability (UC), a common requirement for such protocols. Most of the works that investigated SE focus on its strong variant which implies proof nonmalleability. In this work we investigate a relaxed weaker notion, that allows proof randomization, while guaranteeing statement non-malleability, which we argue to be a more natural security property. First, we show that it is already achievable by Groth16, arguably the most efficient and widely deployed SNARK nowadays. Second, we show that because of this, Groth16 can be efficiently transformed into a black-box weakly SE NIZK, which is sufficient for UC protocols.\nTo support the second claim, we present and compare two practical constructions, both of which strike different performance tradeoffs:\nInt-Groth16 makes use of a known transformation that encrypts the witness inside the SNARK circuit. We instantiate this transformation with an efficient SNARK-friendly encryption scheme.\nExt-Groth16 is based on the SAVER encryption scheme (Lee et al.) that plugs the encrypted witness directly into the verification equation, externally to the circuit.

One of the promising candidates to achieve classical delegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote state preparation (RSPCC), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a classical channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing RSPCC as a sub-module is unclear.\nIn this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive Cryptography framework by Maurer and Renner (ICS'11). We first identify the goal of RSPCC as the construction of ideal RSP resources from classical channels and then reveal the security limitations of using RSPCC. First, we uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal RSP resources (from classical channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any classically constructed ideal RSP resource must leak to the server the full classical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated quantum state, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find that the realization of common RSP resources, without weakening their guarantees drastically, is impossible due to the no-cloning theorem. Second, the above result does not rule out that a specific RSPCC protocol can replace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal Blind Quantum Computing (UBQC) protocol of Broadbent et al. (FOCS '09). However, we show that the resulting UBQC protocol cannot maintain its proven composable security as soon as RSPCC is used as a subroutine. Third, we show that replacing the quantum channel of the above UBQC protocol by the RSPCC protocol QFactory of Cojocaru et al. (Asiacrypt '19), preserves the weaker, game-based, security of UBQC.\nView full paper"

Layer-2 protocols are designed to address such limitations. The most prominent class of such protocols are payment channel networks e.g., the Lightning Network for Bitcoin where pairs of participants create channels that can be concatenated into networks. These allow payments across the network without interaction with the blockchain. A drawback is that all intermediary nodes within a payment path must be online. Virtual Channels, as recently proposed by Dziembowski et al. (CCS'18), allow payments without this limitation. However, these can only be implemented on blockchains with smart contract capability therefore limiting its applicability. Our work proposes the notion of --Lightweight-- Virtual Payment Channels, i.e. only requiring timelocks and multisignatures, enabling Virtual Channels on a larger range of blockchain systems of which a prime example is Bitcoin. More concretely, other contributions of this work are (1) to introduce a fully-fledged formalization of our construction, and (2) to present a simulation based proof of security in Canetti's UC Framework.\nView full paper"

The basic idea is simple yet powerful: construct a parallel chain - sidechain - with desired features, and provide a way to transfer coins between the mainchain and the sidechain.\nIn this paper, we introduce Zendoo, a construction for Bitcoin-like blockchain systems that allows the creation and communication with sidechains of different types without knowing their internal structure. We consider a parent-child relationship between the mainchain and sidechains, where sidechain nodes directly observe the mainchain while mainchain nodes only observe cryptographically authenticated certificates from sidechain maintainers. We use zk-SNARKs to construct a universal verifiable transfer mechanism that is used by sidechains.\nMoreover, we propose a specific sidechain construction, named Latus, that can be built on top of this infrastructure, and realizes a decentralized verifiable blockchain system for payments. We leverage the use of recursive composition of zk-SNARKs to generate succinct proofs of sidechain state progression that are used to generate certificates' validity proofs. This allows the mainchain to effciently verify all operations performed in the sidechain without knowing any details about those operations.\nView full paper"

These frameworks have broad applicability: Examples include public-key infrastructures, common reference strings, shared synchronization mechanisms, global blockchains, or even abstractions such as the random oracle. However, the need to work in a specialized framework has been a source of confusion, incompatibility, and an impediment to broader use.\nWe show how security in the presence of a global setup can be captured within the plain UC framework, thus significantly simplifying the treatment. This is done as follows:\n- We extend UC-emulation to the case where both the emulating protocol and the emulated protocol make subroutine calls to protocol that is accessible also outside and . As usual, this notion considers only a single instance of or (alongside ).\n- We extend the UC theorem to hold even with respect to the new notion of UC emulation. That is, we show that if UC-emulates in the presence of , then UC-emulates for any protocol , even when uses directly, and in addition calls many instances of , all of which use the same instance of . We prove this extension using the existing UC theorem as a black box, thus further simplifying the treatment.\nWe also exemplify how our treatment can be used to streamline, within the plain UC model, proofs of security of systems that involve global set-up, thus providing greater simplicity and flexibility.\nView full paper"

This arises from the need to collect a sufficient number of blocks on top of a transaction-bearing block to guarantee the transaction's stability while limiting the rate at which blocks can be created in order to prevent security-threatening forks.\nOur main result is a black-box security-amplifying combiner based on parallel composition of m blockchains that achieves (m)-fold security amplification or, equivalently, (m)-fold reduction in latency. Our construction breaks the latency barrier to achieve, for the first time, a worst-case constant-time-settlement ledger based purely on Nakamoto longest-chain consensus: Transaction settlement can be accelerated to a constant multiple of block propagation time with negligible error.\nOperationally, our construction shows how to view any family of blockchains as a unified, virtual ledger without requiring any coordination among the chains or any new protocol metadata. Users of the system have the option to inject a transaction into a single constituent blockchain or--if they desire accelerated settlement--all of the constituent blockchains. Our presentation and proofs introduce a new formalism for reasoning about blockchains, the dynamic ledger, and articulate our constructions as transformations of dynamic ledgers that amplify security. We additionally illustrate the versatility of this formalism by presenting a class of robust-combiner constructions for blockchains that can protect against complete adversarial control of a minority of a family of blockchains.\nView full paper"

The protocol must support constantly changing group membership, make no assumptions about when, if, or for how long members come online, nor rely on any trusted group managers. Due to sessions' long life-time, CGKA protocols must simultaneously ensure both post-compromise security and forward secrecy (PCFS). That is, current key material should be secure despite both past and future compromises.\nThe work of Alwen et al. (CRYPTO'20), introduced the CGKA primitive and identified it as a crucial component for constructing end-to-end secure group messaging protocols (SGM) (though we believe there are certainly more applications given the fundamental nature of key agreement). The authors analyzed the TreeKEM CGKA, which lies at the heart of the SGM protocol under development by the IETF working group on Messaging Layer Security (MLS).\nIn this work, we continue the study of CGKA as a stand-alone cryptographic primitive. We present 3 new security notions with increasingly powerful adversaries. Even the weakest of the 3 (passive security) already permits attacks to which all prior constructions (including all variants of TreeKEM) are vulnerable.\nGoing further, the 2 stronger (active security) notions additionally allow the adversary to use parties' exposed states (and full network control) to mount attacks. These are closely related to so-called insider attacks, which involve malicious group members actively deviating from the protocol. Insider attacks present a significant challenge in the study of CGKA (and SGM). Indeed, we believe ours to be the first security notions (and constructions) to formulate meaningful guarantees (e.g. PCFS) against such powerful adversaries. They are also the first composable security notions for CGKA of any type at all.\nIn terms of constructions, for each of the 3 security notions we provide a new CGKA scheme enjoying sub-linear (potentially even logarithmic) communication complexity in the number of group members. We prove each scheme optimally secure, in the sense that the only security violations possible are those necessarily implied by correctness.\nView full paper"

Current analyses of these protocols reduce consistency to the dynamics of an abstract, round-based block creation process that is determined by three probabilities: pAh, the probability that a round has a single honest leader; and pH, the probability that a round has multiple, but honest, leaders.\nWe present a consistency analysis that achieves the optimal threshold ph + pH pA. This is a first in the literature and can be applied to both the simple synchronous setting and the setting with bounded delays. Moreover, we achieve the optimal consistency error e (k) where k is the confirmation time. We also provide an efficient algorithm to explicitly calculate these error probabilities in the synchronous setting.\nAll existing consistency analyses either incur a penalty for rounds with concurrent honest leaders, or treat them neutrally. Specifically, the consistency analyses in Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Genesis (CCS 2018) assume that the probability of a uniquely honest round exceeds that of the other two events combined (i.e., ph - pH pA); the analyses in Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017) and Snow White (Fin. Crypto 2019) assume that a uniquely honest round is more likely than an adversarial round (i.e., ph pA). In addition, previous analyses completely break down when uniquely honest rounds become less frequent, i.e., ph pA. These thresholds determine the critical trade-off between the honest majority, network delays, and consistency error.\nOur new results can be directly applied to improve consistency of the existing protocols. We complement these results with a consistency analysis in the setting where uniquely honest slots are rare, even letting ph= 0, under the added assumption that honest players adopt a consistent chain selection rule.\nView full paper"

While the first two properties have been extensively studied, iterated hardness has been empirically stress-tested since the rise of Bitcoin; in fact, as we demonstrate in this paper, any attack against it (assuming the other two properties hold) results in an attack against Bitcoin.\nIn addition, iterated hardness puts forth a new class of search problems which we term iterated search problems (ISP).

User-defined assets are non-native on Ethereum; i.e., they are not directly supported by the ledger, but require repetitive custom code. This makes them unnecessarily inefficient, expensive, and complex. It also makes them insecure as numerous incidents on Ethereum have demonstrated. Even without stateful smart contracts, the lack of perfect fungibility of Bitcoin assets allows for implementing user-defined tokens as layer-two solutions, which also adds an additional layer of complexity. In this paper, we explore an alternative design based on Bitcoin-style UTXO ledgers. Instead of introducing general scripting capabilities together with the associated security risks, we propose an extension of the UTXO model, where we replace the accounting structure of a single cryptocurrency with a new structure that manages an unbounded number of user defined, native tokens, which we call token bundles. Token creation is controlled by forging policy scripts that, just like Bitcoin validator scripts, use a small domain-specific language with bounded computational expressiveness, thus favouring Bitcoin s security and computational austerity. The resulting approach is lightweight, i.e., custom asset creation and transfer is cheap, and it avoids use of any global state in the form of an asset registry or similar. The proposed UTXOma model and the semantics of the scripting language have been formalised in the Agda proof assistant.\nView full paper"

The availability of a decentralized blockchain such as that offered by the Bitcoin protocol offers new possibilities to realise timestamping services. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are no recent blockchain-based proposals that are formally proved in a composable setting.\nIn this work, we put forth the first formal treatment of timestamping cryptographic primitives in the UC framework with respect to a global clock we refer to the corresponding primitives as timed to indicate this association. We propose timed versions of primitives commonly used for authenticating information, such as digital signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and signatures of knowledge and show how those can be UC-securely implemented by a protocol that makes ideal (blackbox) access to a global transaction ledger based on the ledger proposed by Badertscher et al. [CRYPTO 2017] which is UC realized by the Bitcoin backbone protocol [Eurocrypt 2015]. Our definitions introduce a fine-grained treatment of the different timestamping guarantees, namely security against postdating and backdating attacks; our results treat each of these cases separately and in combination, and shed light on the assumptions that they rely on. Our constructions rely on a relaxation of an ideal beacon functionality, which we implement UC-securely assuming the ledger functionality. Given the many potential uses of such a beacon in cryptographic protocols this result may be of independent interest.\nView full paper"

User-defined tokens are nonnative on Ethereum; i.e., they are not directly supported by the ledger, but require custom code. This makes them unnecessarily inefficient, expensive, and complex. The Extended UTXO Model (EUTXO) (WTSC'20) has been introduced as a generalisation of Bitcoinstyle UTXO ledgers, allowing support of more expressive smart contracts, approaching the functionality available to contracts on Ethereum. Specifically, a bisimulation argument established a formal relationship between the EUTXO ledger and a general form of state machines. Nevertheless, transaction outputs in the EUTXO model lock integral quantities of a single native cryptocurrency only, just like Bitcoin. In this paper, we study a generalisation of the EUTXO ledger model with native user-defined tokens. Following the approach proposed in a companion paper [4] for the simpler case of plain Bitcoin-style UTXO ledgers, we generalise transaction outputs to lock not merely coins of a single cryptocurrency, but entire token bundles, including custom tokens whose forging is controlled by forging policy scripts. We show that this leads to a rich ledger model that supports a broad range of interesting use cases. Our main technical contribution is a formalisation of the multi-asset EUTXO ledger in Agda, which we use to establish that the ledger with custom tokens is strictly more expressive than the original EUTXO ledger. In particular, we state and prove a transfer result for inductive and temporal properties from state machines to the multi-asset EUTXO ledger, which was out of scope for the single-currency EUTXO ledger.

Such clients can be embedded within othe blockchains by implementing them as smart contracts, allowing for cross-chain verification. One such interesting instance is the consumption of Bitcoin data within Ethereum by implementing a Bitcoin superlight client in Solidity. While such theoretical constructions have demonstrated security and efficiency in theory, no practical implementation exists. In this work, we put forth the first practical Solidity implementation of a superlight client which implements the NIPoPoW superblocks protocol. Contrary to previous work, our Solidity smart contract achieves sufficient gas-efficiency to allow a proof and counter-proof to fit within the gas limit of a block, making it practical. We provide extensive experimental measurements for gas consumption. The optimizations that enable gas-efficiency heavily leverage a novel technique which we term hash-and-resubmit, which almost completely eliminates persistent storage requirements, the most expensive operation of smart contracts in terms of gas. Instead, the contract asks contesters to resubmit data and checks their veracity by hashing it. Other optimizations include off-chain manipulation of proofs in order to remove expensive look-up structures, and the usage of an optimistic schema. We show that such techniques can be used to bring down gas costs significantly and may be of independent interest. Lastly, our implementation allows us to calculate concrete cryptoeconomic parameters for the superblocks NIPoPoWs protocol and in particular to make recommendations about the monetary value of the collateral parameters. We provide such parameter recommendations over a variety of liveness settings.\nView full paper"

The activation of such changes might jeopardize the integrity of the blockchain by resulting in chain splits. Moreover, the software update process should be handed over to the community and this means that the blockchain should support updates without relying on a trusted party. In this paper, we introduce the notion of updatable blockchains and show how to construct blockchains that satisfy this definition. Informally, an updatable blockchain is a secure blockchain and in addition it allows to update its protocol preserving the history of the chain. In this work, we focus only on the processes that allow securely switching from one blockchain protocol to another assuming that the blockchain protocols are correct. That is, we do not aim at providing a mechanism that allows reaching consensus on what is the code of the new blockchain protocol. We just assume that such a mechanism exists (like the one proposed in NDSS 2019 by Zhang et. al), and show how to securely go from the old protocol to the new one. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows. We provide the first formal definition of updatable ledgers and propose the description of two compilers. These compilers take a blockchain and turn it into an updatable blockchain. The first compiler requires the structure of the current and the updated blockchain to be very similar (only the structure of the blocks can be different) but it allows for an update process more simple, efficient. The second compiler that we propose is very generic (i.e., makes few assumptions on the similarities between the structure of the current blockchain and the update blockchain). The drawback of this compiler is that it requires the new blockchain to be resilient against a specific adversarial behaviour and requires all the honest parties to be online during the update process. However, we show how to get rid of the latest requirement (the honest parties being online during the update) in the case of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake ledgers.\nView full paper"

Our equilibria also exhibit an efficiency / security tradeoff via a parameter that allows them to be calibrated and include only the pools with the smallest possible cost or provide protection against Sybil attacks, the setting where a single stakeholder creates a large number of pools in the hopes to dominate the collaborative project. We also experimentally demonstrate the reachability of such equilibria in dynamic environments where players react to each others strategic moves over an indefinite period of interactive play, while showing how simple reward sharing schemes, such that inspired by Bitcoin, converge to centralisation.\nView full paper"

If users are offline and abstain from the PoS consensus mechanism, the system s security is at risk, so it is imperative to explore ways to both maximize the level of participation and minimize the effects of non-participation. One such option is stake representation, such that users can delegate their participation rights and, in the process, form stake pools . The core idea is that stake pool operators always participate on behalf of regular users, while the users retain the ownership of their assets. Our work provides a formal PoS wallet construction that enables delegation and stake pool formation. While investigating the construction of addresses in this setting, we distil and explore address malleability, a security property that captures the ability of an attacker to manipulate the delegation information associated with an address. Our analysis consists of identifying multiple levels of malleability, which are taken into account in our paper s core result. We then introduce the first ideal functionality of a PoS wallet s core which captures the PoS wallet s capabilities and is realized as a secure protocol based on standard cryptographic primitives. Finally, we cover how to use the wallet core in conjunction with a PoS ledger, as well as investigate how delegation and stake pools affect a PoS system s security.\nView full paper"

One-stop-shop multi-purpose and multi-asset platforms will be a key characteristic of post-COVID-19 finance bringing a radical transformation of the marketplace. Anticipated benefits range from a drastic reduction of intermediary rents and transaction costs to repatriation of investor control and alteration of today s narrow asset allocation strategies. To facilitate this transformation, we offer a model of decentralised finance that goes far beyond so-called autonomous finance. As the technical and regulatory challenges of increasing automation and integration in the supply of investment services will be considerable, a proactive approach is required to resolve these problems. Integrated decentralised platforms are the most promising route to: (a) counter the competitive threat of BigTech, (b) reform investment industry s narrow asset allocation practices whose fragility has been badly exposed by the pandemic, and, (c) spread equally the dividend of financial development.\nView full paper"

It is useful for a smart contract to be able to react to events and read the state of other smart contracts. In this paper, we devise a mechanism by which a derivative smart contract can read data, observe the state evolution, and react to events that take place in one or more underlying smart contracts of its choice. Our mechanism works even if the underlying smart contract is not designed to operate with the derivative smart contract. Like in traditional finance, derivatives derive their value (and more generally state) through potentially complex dependencies. We show how derivative smart contracts can be deployed in practice on the Ethereum blockchain without any forks or additional assumptions. We leverage any NIPoPoWs mechanism (such as FlyClient or superblocks) to obtain succinct proofs for arbitrary events, making proving them inexpensive for users. The latter construction is of particular interest, as it forms the first introspective SPV client: an SPV client for Ethereum in Ethereum. Last, we describe applications of smart contract derivatives which were not possible prior to our work, in particular the ability to create decentralized insurance smart contracts which insure an underlying on-chain security such as an ICO, as well as futures and options.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Security Analysis and Improvements for the IETF MLS Standard for Group Messaging\nAugust/2020, CRYPTO '20\nCRYPTOGRAPHY\nSecure messaging (SM) protocols allow users to communicate securely over untrusted infrastructure. In contrast to most other secure communication protocols (such as TLS, SSH, or Wireguard), SM sessions may be long-lived (e.g., years) and highly asynchronous. In order to deal with likely state compromises of users during the lifetime of a session, SM protocols do not only protect authenticity and privacy, but they also guarantee forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS). The former ensures that messages sent and received before a state compromise remain secure, while the latter ensures that users can recover from state compromise as a consequence of normal protocol usage.\nSM has received considerable attention in the two-party case, where prior work has studied the well-known double-ratchet paradigm in particular and SM as a cryptographic primitive in general. Unfortunately, this paradigm does not scale well to the problem of secure group messaging (SGM). In order to address the lack of satisfactory SGM protocols, the IETF has launched the message-layer security (MLS) working group, which aims to standardize an eponymous SGM protocol. In this work we analyze the TreeKEM protocol, which is at the core of the SGM protocol proposed by the MLS working group.\nOn a positive note, we show that TreeKEM achieves PCS in isolation (and slightly more). However, we observe that the current version of TreeKEM does not provide an adequate form of FS. More precisely, our work proceeds by formally capturing the exact security of TreeKEM as a so-called continuous group key agreement (CGKA) protocol, which we believe to be a primitive of independent interest. To address the insecurity of TreeKEM, we propose a simple modification to TreeKEM inspired by recent work of Jost et al. (EUROCRYPT '19) and an idea due to Kohbrok (MLS Mailing List). We then show that the modified version of TreeKEM comes with almost no efficiency degradation but achieves optimal (according to MLS specification) CGKA security, including FS and PCS. Our work also lays out how a CGKA protocol can be used to design a full SGM protocol.\nFinally, we propose and motivate an extensive list of potential future research directions for the area.\nView full paper"

From an Agile perspective, there is pressure to deliver quickly, building vertical prototypes and doing many iterations /sprints, refining the requirements; from a Formal Methods perspective, there is pressure to deliver correctly and any change in requirements often necessitates changes in the formal specification and might even impact all arguments of correctness.\nOver the years, the need to \"be agile\" has become a kind of mantra in software development management, and there is a prevalent prejudice that using formal methods was an impediment to being agile. In this paper, we contribute to the refutation of this stereotype, by providing a real-world example of using good practices from formal methods and agile software engineering to deliver software that is simultaneously reliable, effective, testable, and that can also be iterated and delivered rapidly. We thus present how a lightweight software engineering methodology, drawing from appropriate formal methods techniques and providing the benefits of agile software development, can look like. Our methodology is informed and motivated by practical experience. We have devised and adapted it in the light of experience in delivering a large-scale software system that needs to meet complex real-world requirements: the Cardano blockchain and its cryptocurrency ada.\nThe cryptocurrency domain is a rather new application area for which no clear engineering habit exists, so it is fitting well for agile methods. At the same time, there is a lot of real monetary value at stake, making it a good fit for using formal methods to ensure high quality and correctness. This paper reports on the issues that have been faced and overcome, and provides a number of real-world lessons that can be used to leverage the benefits of both agile and formal methods in other situations.\nView full paper"

Despite that, the functionality of wallets has never been formally defined. Additionally, the mechanisms employed by the many wallets in the wild remain hidden in their respective codebases.\nIn this work we provide the first definition of a cryptocurrency wallet, which we model as a client to a server, or set of servers. We provide a distinction of wallets in various categories, based on whether they work for transparent or private cryptocurrencies, what trust assumptions they require, their performance and their communication overhead. For each type of wallet we provide a description of its client and server protocols. Additionally, we explore superlight wallets and describe their difference to superlight clients that have appeared in recent literature.

More specifically, all major blockchain systems use randomized cryptographic primitives, such as digital signatures and non-interactive zeroknowledge proofs; we illustrate how the uncontrolled randomness in such primitives can be maliciously manipulated to enable covert communication and hidden persistent storage. To clarify the potential risk, we design, implement and evaluate our technique against the widely-used ECDSA signature scheme, the CryptoNote s ring signature scheme, and Monero s ring confidential transactions. Importantly, the significance of the demonstrated attacks stems from their undetectability, their adverse effect on the future of decentralized blockchains, and their serious repercussions on users privacy and crypto funds.

While such signatures are of course impossible classically, we construct one-shot signatures using quantum no-cloning. In particular, we show that such signatures exist relative to a classical oracle, which we can then heuristically obfuscate using known indistinguishability obfuscation schemes.\nWe show that one-shot signatures have numerous applications for hybrid quantum/classical cryptographic tasks, where all communication is required to be classical, but local quantum operations are allowed. Applications include one-time signature tokens, quantum money with classical communication, decentralized blockchain-less cryptocurrency, signature schemes with unclonable secret keys, non-interactive certifiable min-entropy, and more.

As a result, our treatment delineates exactly how the security guarantees of the protocol depend on the properties of the underlying ledger. Moreover, we provide a complete and modular description of the core of the lightning protocol that highlights precisely its dependency to underlying basic cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures, pseudorandom functions, identity-based signatures and a less common two-party primitive, which we term a combined digital signature, that were originally hidden within the lightning protocol s implementation.\nView full paper"

The protocol relies on a cryptographic primitive known as proof of work (PoW) which is used to throttle message passing with the PoW difficulty level being adjusted appropriately throughout the course of the protocol execution.\nWhile the original formulation was only accompanied by rudimentary analysis, significant and steady progress has been made in abstracting out the protocol s properties and providing a formal analysis under various restrictions, starting with the work by Garay, Kiayias and Leonardos [Eurocrypt 15], for a simplified version of the protocol which excluded PoW difficulty adjustment and assumed a fixed number of parties as well as synchronous communication rounds. These assumptions have since been somewhat relaxed, first by Pass, Seeman and Shelat [Eurocrypt 17] who also focused on the simplified version of the protocol but on the bounded-delay model of communication, and by Garay, Kiayias and Leonardos [Crypto 17] who looked into the full protocol including the PoW difficulty adjustment mechanism with a variable number of parties but assuming synchronous communication and a predetermined schedule of participation. Despite the above progress, the full analysis of the protocol in the more realistic setting of bounded delays and dynamic participation has remained elusive.\nThis paper s main result is the proof that Nakamoto s protocol achieves, under suitable conditions, consistency and liveness in bounded-delay networks with adaptive (as opposed to predetermined) dynamic participation assuming, as before, that the majority of the computational power favors the honest parties.

At the same time, these two public blockchains differ strongly in the expressiveness of the smart contracts that they support. This is no coincidence. Ethereum chose the account model explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts. On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO also for good reasons, including that its semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed computing environment. This raises the question of whether it is possible to have expressive smart contracts, while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model.\nIn this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We present Extended UTXO (EUTXO), an extension to Bitcoin s UTXO model that supports a substantially more expressive form of validation scripts, including scripts that implement general state machines and enforce invariants across entire transaction chains.\nTo demonstrate the power of this model, we also introduce a form of state machines suitable for execution on a ledger, based on Mealy machines and called Constraint Emitting Machines (CEM). We formalise CEMs, show how to compile them to EUTXO, and show a weak bisimulation between the two systems. All of our work is formalised using the Agda proof assistant.\nView full paper"

However, for various reasons this distribution cannot be completely up-to-date, introducing a gap between the present stake distribution, which determines the parties' current incentives, and the one used by the protocol. In this paper, we investigate this issue, and empirically quantify its effects. We survey existing provably secure PoS proposals to observe that the above time gap between the two stake distributions, which we call stake distribution lag, amounts to several days for each of these protocols. Based on this, we investigate the ledgers of four major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Zcash) and compute the average stake shift (the statistical distance of the two distributions) for each value of stake distribution lag between 1 and 14 days, as well as related statistics. We also empirically quantify the sublinear growth of stake shift with the length of the considered lag interval.

Despite its well known use, the mechanism has not been previously formally studied as a primitive. In this paper, we put forth the first cryptographic definition of what a proofof-burn protocol is. It consists of two functions: First, a function which generates a cryptocurrency address. When a user sends money to this address, the money is irrevocably destroyed. Second, a verification function which checks that an address is really unspendable. We propose the following properties for burn protocols. Unspendability, which mandates that an address which verifies correctly as a burn address cannot be used for spending; binding, which allows associating metadata with a particular burn; and uncensorability, which mandates that a burn address is indistinguishable from a regular cryptocurrency address. Our definition captures all previously known proof-of-burn protocols. Next, we design a novel construction for burning which is simple and flexible, making it compatible with all existing popular cryptocurrencies. We prove our scheme is secure in the Random Oracle model. We explore the application of destroying value in a legacy cryptocurrency to bootstrap a new one. The user burns coins in the source blockchain and subsequently creates a proof-of-burn, a short string proving that the burn took place, which she then submits to the destination blockchain to be rewarded with a corresponding amount. The user can use a standard wallet to conduct the burn without requiring specialized software, making our scheme user friendly. We propose burn verification mechanisms with different security guarantees, noting that the target blockchain miners do not necessarily need to monitor the source blockchain. Finally, we implement the verification of Bitcoin burns as an Ethereum smart contract and experimentally measure that the gas costs needed for verification are as low as standard Bitcoin transaction fees, illustrating that our scheme is practical.\nView full paper"

In this work, we construct a new primitive called Non-Interactive-Proofs-of-Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) that can be adapted into existing PoW-based cryptocurrencies to improve their performance and extend their functionality. Unlike a traditional blockchain client which must verify the entire linearly-growing chain of PoWs, clients based on NIPoPoWs require resources only logarithmic in the length of the blockchain. NIPoPoWs are thus succinct proofs and require only a single message between the prover and the verifier of the transaction.\nWith our construction we are able to prove a broad array of useful predicates in the context of cross PoW-based blockchain transfers of assets, including predicates about facts buried deep within a blockchain which is necessary for the basic application of accepting payments. We provide empirical validation for NIPoPoWs through an implementation and benchmark study, in the context of two new applications: First, we consider a multi-client blockchain that supports all proof-of-work currencies rather than just one, with up to 90 reduction in bandwidth.

Non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes have been proposed to tackle these issues. However, tenets in the folklore say that such schemes could potentially be bypassed by using escrow mechanisms. In this work, we propose a concrete example of such a mechanism which is using collateralized smart contracts. Our approach allows miners to bypass non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes if the underlying blockchain platform supports smart contracts in a sufficiently advanced language. In particular, the language should allow access to the PoW solution. At a high level, our approach requires the miner to lock collateral covering the reward amount and protected by a smart contract that acts as an escrow. The smart contract has logic that allows the pool to collect the collateral as soon as the miner collects any block reward. We propose two variants of the approach depending on when the collateral is bound to the block solution. Using this, we show how to bypass previously proposed non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes (with the notable exception for strong non-outsourceable schemes) and show how to build mining pools for such schemes.\nView full paper"

The technique popularized by the Bitcoin protocol has proven to be remarkably flexible and now supports consensus algorithms in a wide variety of settings. Despite such broad applicability and adoption, current analytic understanding of the technique is highly dependent on details of the protocol s leader election scheme. A particular challenge appears in the proof-of-stake setting, where existing analyses suffer from quadratic dependence on suffix length.\nWe describe an axiomatic theory of blockchain dynamics that permits rigorous reasoning about the longest-chain rule in quite general circumstances and establish bounds optimal to within a constant on the probability of a consistency violation. This settles a critical open question in the proof-of-stake setting where we achieve linear consistency for the first time.\nOperationally, blockchain consensus protocols achieve consistency by instructing parties to remove a suffix of a certain length from their local blockchain. While the analysis of Bitcoin guarantees consistency with error 2 k by removing O(k) blocks, recent work on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains has suffered from quadratic dependence: (PoS) blockchain protocols, exemplified by Ouroboros (Crypto 2017), Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017), can only establish that the length of this suffix should be (k2). This consistency guarantee is a fundamental design parameter for these systems, as the length of the suffix is a lower bound for the time required to wait for transactions to settle. Whether this gap is an intrinsic limitation of PoS due to issues such as the nothing-at-stake problem has been an urgent open question as deployed PoS blockchains further rely on consistency for protocol correctness: in particular, security of the protocol itself relies on this parameter. Our general theory directly improves the required suffix length from (k2) to (k). Thus we show, for the first time, how PoS protocols can match proof-of-work blockchain protocols for exponentially decreasing consistency error.\nOur analysis focuses on the articulation of a two-dimensional stochastic process that captures the features of interest, an exact recursive closed form for the critical functional of the process, and tail bounds established for associated generating functions that dominate the failure events. Finally, the analysis provides an explicit polynomial-time algorithm for exactly computing the exponentially-decaying error function which can directly inform practice.\nView full paper"

In many systems each client downloads and verifies every new proof, and so proofs must be small and cheap to verify. The most practical schemes require either a trusted setup, as in (pre-processing) zk-SNARKs, or verification complexity that scales linearly with the complexity of the relation, as in Bulletproofs. The structured reference strings required by most zk-SNARK schemes can be constructed with multi-party computation protocols, but the resulting parameters are specific to an individual relation. Groth et al. discovered a zk-SNARK protocol with a universal and updateable structured reference string, however the string scales quadratically in the size of the supported relations.\nHere we describe a zero-knowledge SNARK, Sonic, which sup- ports a universal and continually updateable structured reference string that scales linearly in size. Sonic proofs are constant size, and in the batch verification context the marginal cost of verification is comparable with the most efficient SNARKs in the literature. We also describe a generally useful technique in which untrusted helpers can compute advice which allows batches of proofs to be verified more efficiently.\nView full paper"

Their aim is immutability: once a block has been added to the chain it should not be altered or removed. The seminal blockchain, Bitcoin, uses a graph-based model that is purely functional in nature. But Bitcoin has limited support for smart contracts and distributed applications. The seminal smart-contract platform, Ethereum, uses an imperative and object-oriented model of accounts. Ethereum has been subject to numerous exploits, often linked to its use of shared mutable state by way of its imperative and object-oriented features in a concurrent and distributed system. Coding a distributed application for Ethereum requires two languages: Javascript to run off-chain, which submits transaction written in Solidity to run on-chain.\nThis paper describes Plutus Platform, a functional blockchain smart contract system for coding distributed applications on top of the Cardano blockchain. Most blockchain programming platforms depend on a custom language, such as Ethereum s Solidity, but Plutus is provided as a set of libraries for Haskell. Both off-chain and on-chain code are written in Haskell: off-chain code using the Plutus library, and on-chain code in a subset of Haskell using Template Haskell. On-chain code is compiled to a tiny functional language called Plutus Core, which is System F with iso-recursive types and suitable primitives.\nPlutus and Cardano are available open source, and Plutus Playground provides a web-based IDE that enables users to try out the system and to develop simple applications.\nView full paper"

    "completion": "English\nLibrary Cryptocurrency Egalitarianism: A Quantitative Approach\nMay/2019, Tokenomics 2019\nCRYPTOCURRENCY\nSince the invention of Bitcoin one decade ago, numerous cryptocurrencies have sprung into existence. Among these, proof-of-work is the most common mechanism for achieving consensus, whilst a number of coins have adopted \"ASIC-resistance\" as a desirable property, claiming to be more \"egalitarian\", where egalitarianism refers to the power of each coin to participate in the creation of new coins. While proof-of-work consensus dominates the space, several new cryptocurrencies employ alternative consensus, such as proof-of-stake in which block minting opportunities are based on monetary ownership. A core criticism of proof-of-stake revolves around it being less egalitarian by making the rich richer, as opposed to proof-of-work in which everyone can contribute equally according to their computational power. In this paper, we give the first quantitative definition of a cryptocurrency's egalitarianism. Based on our definition, we measure the egalitarianism of popular cryptocurrencies that (may or may not) employ ASIC-resistance, among them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Our simulations show, as expected, that ASIC-resistance increases a cryptocurrency's egalitarianism. We also measure the egalitarianism of a stake-based protocol, Ouroboros, and a hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work cryptocurrency, Decred. We show that stake-based cryptocurrencies, under correctly selected parameters, can be perfectly egalitarian, perhaps contradicting folklore belief.\nView full paper"

If additionally a block satisfies H(B) T2 , it is called a -superblock. Superblocks play an important role in the construction of compact blockchain proofs which allows the compression of PoW blockchains into so-called Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-ofWork (NIPoPoWs). These certificates are essential for the construction of superlight clients, which are blockchain wallets that can synchronize exponentially faster than traditional SPV clients.\nIn this work, we measure the distribution of superblocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. We find that the superblock distribution within the blockchain follows expectation, hence we empirically verify that the distribution of superblocks within the Bitcoin blockchain has not been adversarially biased. NIPoPoWs require that each block in a blockchain points to a sample of previous blocks in the blockchain. These pointers form a data structure called the interlink. We give efficient ways to store the interlink data structure. Repeated superblock references within an interlink can be omitted with no harm to security. Hence, it is more efficient to store a set of superblocks rather than a list. We show that, in honest executions, this simple observation reduces the number of superblock references by approximately a half in expectation. We then verify our theoretical result by measuring the improvement over existing blockchains in terms of the interlink sizes (which we improve by 79 ) and the sizes of succinct NIPoPoWs (which we improve by 25 ). As such, we show that deduplication allows superlight clients to synchronize 25 faster.\nView full paper"

This holds, especially, in terms of number of transactions per second. Several alternatives are currently being pursued by both the research and practitioner communities. One venue for exploration is on protocols that do not constantly add transactions on the blockchain and therefore do not consume the blockchain s resources. This is done using off-chain transactions, i.e., protocols that minimize the interaction with the blockchain, also commonly known as Layer-2 approaches. This work relates several existing off-chain channel methods, also known as payment and state channels, channel network constructions methods, and other components as channel and network management protocols, e.g., routing nodes. All these components are crucial to keep the usability of the channel, and are often overlooked. For the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a taxonomy for all the components of the Layer-2. We provide an extensive coverage on the state-of-art protocols available.

Yet the utility of complex FMI comprising long custodial chains and large global Central Counterparties (CCPs) for the operation of modern markets is not seriously disputed. The change in the technology paradigm with the introduction of DLT systems for securities and derivatives FMI can increase investor control, the efficiency of risk management and, to some extent, augment the distribution of systemic risk.

Even though folklore holds that poker protocols can be used to play any card game, this conjecture remains unproven and, in fact, does not hold for a number of protocols (including recent results). We both tackle the problem of constructing protocols for general card games and initiate a treatment of such protocols in the Universal Composability (UC) framework, introducing an ideal functionality that captures general card games constructed from a set of core card operations. Based on this formalism, we introduce Royale, the first universally composable protocol for securely playing general card games with financial rewards/penalties enforcement. We remark that Royale also yields the first universally composable poker protocol.

Nevertheless, each of these coins functions in a stand-alone manner, independently. Sidechains have been envisioned as a mechanism to allow blockchains to communicate with one another and, among other applications, allow the transfer of value from one chain to another, but so far there have been no decentralized constructions. In this paper, we put forth the first sidechains construction that allows communication between proof-of-work blockchains without trusted intermediaries. Our construction is generic in that it allows the passing of any information between blockchains. It gives rise to two illustrative examples: the remote ICO, in which an investor pays in currency on one blockchain to receive tokens in another, and the two-way peg, in which an asset can be transferred from one chain to another and back. We pinpoint the features needed for two chains to communicate: On the source side, a proof-of-work blockchain that has been interlinked, potentially with a velvet fork; on the destination side, a blockchain with any consensus mechanism that has sufficient expressibility to implement verification. We model our construction mathematically and give a formal proof of security. In the heart of our construction, we use a recently introduced cryptographic primitive, Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs). Our security proof uses a standard cryptographic reduction from our new proof-of-work sidechains protocol to the security of NIPoPoWs, which has, in turn, been shown to be secure in previous work. Our working assumption is honest majority in each of the communicating chains. We demonstrate the feasibility of our construction by providing an implementation in the form of a Solidity smart contract.\nView full paper"

The Dash governance system is a real-world example of such kind of systems. In this work, we, for the first time, provide a rigorous study of the security of the treasury system.

We identify the properties and security parameters of a Bitcoin wallet and formally define them in the Universal Composition (UC) Framework. We present a modular treatment of a hardware wallet ecosystem, by realizing the wallet functionality in a hybrid setting defined by a set of protocols. This approach allows us to capture in detail the wallet's components, their interaction and the potential threats.

The major insight of our work is that various types of puncturable pseudorandom functions (PRFs) can achieve leakage resilience on an obfuscated street.\nFirst, we build leakage-resilient weak PRFs from weak puncturable PRFs and iO, which readily imply leakage-resilient secret-key encryption. Second, we build leakage-resilient publicly evaluable PRFs (PEPRFs) from puncturable PEPRFs and iO, which readily imply leakage-resilient key encapsulation mechanism and thus public-key encryption. As a building block of independent interest, we realize puncturable PEPRFs from either newly introduced puncturable objects such as puncturable trapdoor functions and puncturable extractable hash proof systems or existing puncturable PRFs with iO. Finally, we construct the first leakage-resilient public-coin signature from selective puncturable PRFs, leakage-resilient one-way functions and iO. This settles the open problem posed by Boyle, Segev and Wichs (Eurocrypt 2011).\nBy further assuming the existence of lossy functions, all the above constructions achieve optimal leakage rate of 1 o(1).

Nevertheless, errors in those programs can cause important, and often irretrievable, monetary loss. General-purpose languages provide a platform on which contracts can be built, but by their very generality they have the potential to exhibit behaviours of an unpredictable kind, and are also not easy to read or comprehend for general users.\nAn alternative solution is provided by domain-specific languages (DSLs), which are designed to express programs in a particular field. This paper explores the design of one DSL, Marlowe, targeted at the execution of financial contracts in the style of Peyton Jones et al on blockchains. We present an executable semantics of Marlowe in Haskell, an example of Marlowe in practice, and describe the Meadow tool that allows users to interact in-browser with simulations of Marlowe contracts.\nView full paper"

We consider security properties of decentralized blockchain-based consensus protocols. The object of research is block confirmation time for users to get assurance that their transaction will not be reverted.\nObjective. The goal of the paper is to analyze double-spend attacks on the different blockchain-based systems and compare resulting probabilities of attacker's success.\nMethod. We presented two models for two types of attacks on the Ouroboros protocol (for the general and covert adversaries). The models allow calculating the exact number of slots needed to achieve the required level of security. It was shown that the Ouroboros protocol allows achieving the required security level with significantly shorter confirmation period in comparison with Bitcoin. We estimated minimal number of confirmation blocks and compare estimation time for Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros protocols. As a measure of comparison, we considered transaction confirmation time for which the probability of a double-spend attack is less than 0.1 . We use different standard probability distribution and different properties of Markov chains and Random Walks to get comparison of estimated security properties of Bitcoin blockchain against three different models of Bitcoin double spend attack. The splitting attack based on the model where resources of honest participants are divided to compete different chains is applied to Bitcoin and GHOST consensus protocols. Properties of Markov chains and Random Walks are also applied to obtain security estimations for the Ouroboros protocol.\nResults. We developed methods to get specific numbers for average block confirmation time for Ouroboros protocol. We compared minimal number of confirmation blocks needed to ensure a high security for considered protocols: Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros.\nConclusions. The obtained results allow determination of security bounds for the Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros consensus protocols. Users of the practically deployed blockchain systems may get specific parameters for a given assurance level.\nView full paper"

This setting, which we refer to as dynamic availability, naturally captures decentralized environments within which real-world deployed blockchain protocols are assumed to operate.\nWe observe that none of the existing PoS-based blockchain protocols can realize the ledger functionality under dynamic availability in the same way that bitcoin does (using only the information available in the genesis block). To address this we propose a new PoS-based protocol, Ouroboros Genesis , that adapts one of the latest cryptographically-secure PoS-based blockchain protocols with a novel chain selection rule. The rule enables new or offline parties to safely (re-)join and bootstrap their blockchain from the genesis block without any trusted advice such as checkpoints or assumptions regarding past availability. We say that such a blockchain protocol can bootstrap from genesis.\nWe prove the GUC security of Ouroboros Genesis against a fully adaptive adversary controlling less than half of the total stake. Our model allows adversarial scheduling of messages in a network with delays and captures the dynamic availability of participants in the worst case. Importantly, our protocol is effectively independent of both the maximum network delay and the minimum level of availability both of which are run-time parameters. Proving the security of our construction against an adaptive adversary requires a novel martingale technique that may be of independent interest in the analysis of blockchain protocols.\nView full paper"

This scenario poses many interesting technical challenges,\nwhich are addressed with cryptographic tools that introduce significant\ncomputational and communication overheads (e.g. zero-knowledge proofs).\nIn this paper, we consider the case of games that do not require any secret\nstate to be maintained (e.g. Blackjack and Baccarat).

Moreover, in constructing highly efficient protocols,\nwe introduce a new technique based on verifiable random functions\nfor extending coin tossing, which is at the core of our constructions. Besides\nensuring that the games are played correctly, our protocols support\nfinancial rewards and penalties enforcement, guaranteeing that winners\nreceive their rewards and that cheaters get financially penalized.

Different from the proof-of-work based Bitcoin, our construction uses two types of resources, computing power and coins (i.e., stake). The blockchain in our system is more robust than that in a pure proof-of-work based system; even if the adversary controls the majority of mining power, we can still have the chance to secure the system by relying on honest stake. In contrast, Bitcoin blockchain will be insecure if the adversary controls more than 50 of mining power.\nOur design follows a recent provably secure proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid blockchain by Duong et al. (ePrint 2016). In order to make our construction practical, we enhance Duong et al. s design.

An essential element of such systems is a routing protocol able to quickly restructure existing routes when nodes leave and provide routes to new nodes. In most MANET routing protocols, nodes are assumed to be altruistic, that is, forward incoming packets to the next node in the route. However, as pointed out in a number of previous works, nodes are often selfish in real world scenarios, refusing to forward incoming packets from their peers but still using the MANET to route their own packets. In this work, we propose MARS, a blockchain-based reputation system that acts as an overlay on top of existing MANET routing protocols (e.g. AODV and OLSR). The main goal of MARS is to keep a publicly available (and verifiable) record of node behavior that can be used to both select good routes and incentivize nodes to actively participate in routing to earn rewards. As a building block, we propose a compact proof-of-routing that allows a node to prove that it has participated in the rout- ing of a batch of packets. Upon presenting such a proof, the node earns a reputation point, which is stored as an asset in the blockchain, and as such can be traded for enhanced network services among MANET nodes or for other assets (e.g. cryptocurrencies) with third parties.\nView full paper"

In a nutshell, these works conclude that Bitcoin is secure if and only if the majority of the mining power is honest. Despite their great impact, however, these works do not address an incisive question asked by positivists and Bitcoin critics, which is fuelled by the fact that Bitcoin indeed works in reality: Why should the real-world system adhere to these assumptions?\nIn this work we employ the machinery from the Rational Protocol Design (RPD) framework by Garay et al. [FOCS 13] to analyze Bitcoin and address questions such as the above. We show assuming a natural class of incentives for the miners behavior i.e., rewarding them for adding blocks to the blockchain but having them pay for mining where one can reserve the honest majority assumption as a fallback, or even, depending on the application, completely replace it by the assumption that the miners aim to maximize their revenue.\nOur results underscore the appropriateness of RPD as a rational cryptography framework for analyzing Bitcoin.

Two main challenges towards bringing it into real-life are enforcing the distribution of the rewards, and penalizing misbehaving/aborting parties. Using recent advances on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, Andrychowicz et al. (IEEE S&P 2014 and FC 2014 BITCOIN Workshop) were able to address those problems. Improving on these results, Kumaresan et al. (CCS 2015) and Bentov et al. (ASIACRYPT 2017) proposed specific purpose poker protocols that made significant progress towards meeting the real-world deployment requirements. However, their protocols still lack either efficiency or a formal security proof in a strong model. Specifically, the work of Kumaresan et al. relies on Bitcoin and simple contracts, but is not very efficient as it needs numerous interactions with the cryptocurrency network as well as a lot of collateral. Bentov et al. achieve further improvements by using stateful contracts and off-chain execution: they show a solution based on general multiparty computation that has a security proof in a strong model, but is also not very efficient. Alternatively, it proposes to use tailor-made poker protocols as a building block to improve the efficiency. However, a security proof is unfortunately still missing for the latter case: the security properties the tailor-made protocol would need to meet were not even specified, let alone proven to be met by a given protocol. Our solution closes this undesirable gap as it concurrently: (1) enforces the rewards distribution; (2) enforces penalties on misbehaving parties; (3) has efficiency comparable to the tailor-made protocols; (4) has a security proof in a simulation-based model of security. Combining techniques from the above works, from tailor-made poker protocols and from efficient zero-knowledge proofs for shuffles, and performing optimizations, we obtain a solution that satisfies all four desired criteria and does not incur a big burden on the blockchain.\nView full paper"

Centralized PKIs (CPKIs) rely on a hierarchy of trusted Certification Authorities (CAs) for issuing, distributing and managing the status of digital certificates, i.e., unforgeable data structures that attest to the authenticity of an entity's public key. Unfortunately, CPKIs have many downsides in terms of security and fault tolerance and there have been numerous security incidents throughout the years. Decentralized PKIs (DPKIs) were proposed to deal with these issues as they rely on multiple, independent nodes. Nevertheless, decentralization raises other concerns such as what are the incentives for the participating nodes to ensure the service's availability.\nIn our work, we leverage the scalability, as well as, the built-in incentive mechanism of blockchain systems and propose a smart contract-based DPKI. The main barrier in realizing a smart contract-based DPKI is the size of the contract's state which, being its most expensive resource to access, should be minimized for a construction to be viable. We resolve this problem by proposing and using in our DPKI a public-state cryptographic accumulator with constant size, a cryptographic tool which may be of independent interest in the context of blockchain protocols.

Importantly, these proofs of work have to be hard enough so that miners have an opportunity to unify their views in the presence of an adversary who interferes but has bounded computational power, but easy enough to be solvable regularly and enable the miners to make progress. As such, as the miners population evolves over time, so should the difficulty of these proofs. Bitcoin provides this adjustment mechanism, with empirical evidence of a constant block generation rate against such population changes.\nIn this paper we provide the first (to our knowledge) formal analysis of Bitcoin s target (re)calculation function in the cryptographic setting, i.e., against all possible adversaries aiming to subvert the protocol s properties. We extend the q-bounded synchronous model of the Bitcoin backbone protocol [Eurocrypt 2015], which posed the basic properties of Bitcoin s underlying blockchain data structure and shows how a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of them, to environments that may introduce or suspend parties in each round.

On the other hand, per-transaction proofs generated by authenticated dictionaries increase the size of the blockchain, which motivates us to find a solution with most compact proofs.\nOur improvements to the design of authenticated dictionaries reduce proof size and speed up verification by 1.4 2.5 times, making them better suited for the cryptocurrency application.

Then we'll explain how monads can be brought into the picture in the context of monoidal categories. This will lead to a precise definition of a free monad as a free monoid.\nThis post requires familiarity with some very basic Category Theory and does not assume any knowledge on universal algebra. Most mathematical notions will be introduced but you might want to dig into literature for some more examples; though most of the books are quite lengthy and not suited for non-mathematicians - you've been warned ;). Knowing this I tried to bring all the required definitions, together with some very basic examples. As you read you may want to read about semigroups, monoids, groups, $G$-sets, lattices, Boolean or Heyting algebras from Wikipedia articles or try to find info on nCatLab (though this is is a heavy resource, with mostly with higher categorical approach, so probably better suited for more familiar readers).\nWe will need some preliminary definitions. Let's begin with a definition of algebra. For a set $A$ we will denote $A n$ the $n$th cartesian product of $A$, i.e. $A 2=A\\times A$.\nExamples includes many classical algebraic structures, like semigroups, where there is only a single operation of arity 2, monoids which in addition have one operation of arity $0$ - the unit element of multiplication. Other source of examples are Boolean algebras with two 2-ary operations $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ or more generally lattices, Heyting algebras. Also rings, modules, fields, vector spaces and countless other structures. Universal algebra has a very general theory describing common concepts but also deals with very special cases of some of more esoteric algebras.\nThis means that homomorphism preserve operations. For example a homomorphism of monoids is a map that preserves the multiplication and unit. For boolean algebras, it means that a homomorphism preserves the $\\vee$ (also called join) and $\\wedge$ (usually called meet) operations, etc.\nIt is an easy observations that homomorphism are closed under composition and since the identity map is always a homomorphism this leads to well defined categories, e.g. category of monoids, category of boolean algebras, category of rings, ...\nAs you can see the definition of a free algebra requires a context, this interesting in its own! There are free monoids in the class of all monoids and there are free commutative monoids in the class of commutative monoids (i.e. monoids in which $m\\cdot n=n\\cdot m$ for each elements $m,n$).\nMany theories allow free algebras. Let's see some other examples:\nThe monoid of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ with addition and $0$ as its unit element is a free monoid generated by $\\{1\\}$. It is both free in the class of all monoids and in the class of commutative ones. The $n$-th cartesian product $\\mathbb{N} n$ is a free commutative monoid generated by the set $\\{(1,0,\\ldots,0),(0,1,0,\\ldots,0),\\ldots,(0,\\ldots,0,1)\\}$, but it's not a free monoid in the class of all monoids.\nThe additive group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a free group with one generator, it is also free in the class of commutative groups. As in monoids: $\\mathbb{Z} n$ is a free commutative group with $n$ generators.\nA free group with two generators can be pictured as the Cayley graph (which is a fractal) (note that its first quarter is the free monoid with two generators).\nEvery vector space is free, since every vector space admits a basis.\nIn the class of $G$-sets, free $G$ sets are exactly all the cartesian products of $G n$.\nIn the class of rings, polynomial rings with integer coefficients, usually denoted by: $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$ or $\\mathbb{Z}[X_1,\\dots,X_n]$ for polynomials with many variables) are free (you likely have learned quite a lot about them in school, you just haven't been told the really interesting part ;)). This example was the motivation for terms, their algebra and term functions which we will discover next.\nThis is also true for semi-rings. You might have used this fact when using purescript validation library. A free semiring generated by a type `a` has type `[[a]]`; for example `[[()]]` is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{N}[X]$, since (please excuse mixing Haskell and mathematical notation): $$[[()]]\\simeq[\\mathbb{N}]\\simeq\\mathbb{N}[X]$$\nFree algebras play an essential role in a proof of beautiful and outstanding Birkhoff theorem. It states that a class of algebras $\\mathcal{C}$ is an equational theory if and only if the class is closed under cartesian products, homomorphic images and subalgebras. Equational theories are classes of algebras which satisfy a set of equations; examples includes: semigroups, monoids, groups or boolean or Heyting algebras but also commutative (abelian) semigroups / monoids / groups, and many other classical algebraic structures.\nWe need to be a little bit more precise language to speak about equational theories in the full generality of universal algebra, which we are going to introduce.\nLet s consider an algebra type $(f_i)_{i=1,\\ldots,n}$. Then the set of terms on a set $X$ (set of variables) is inductively defined as:\neach $x\\in X$ is a term (of arity $0$)\neach $f_i(x_1,\\dots ,x_{j_i})$ is a term of arity $j_i$ for $x_1,\\dots ,x_{j_i}\\in X$\nif $g_1,\\dots g_n$ are terms of arities $j_1$ to $j_n$ respectively, and $g$ is a term of arity $n$ then $g(g_1(x_{11},\\dots,x_{1j_1}),\\dots, g_n(x_{n1},\\dots,x_{nj_n}))$ is a term of arity $j_1+\\dots+j_n$ with $x_{kl}\\in X$.\nWe will denote the set of terms on $X$ by $\\mathsf{T} {(f_i)_{i=1,\\dots,n}}(X)$ or simply $\\mathsf{T}(X)$.\nFor example in groups: $x {-1}\\cdot x$, $x\\cdot y$ and $1$ (the unit of the group) are terms. Terms are just abstract expressions that one can build using algebraic operations that are supported by the algebra type. Each term $t$ defines a term function on every algebra of the given type. In groups the following terms are distinct but they define equal term function: $x {-1}\\cdot x$ and $1$; on the other hand the two (distinct) terms $(x\\cdot y)\\cdot z$ and $x\\cdot (y\\cdot z)$ define equal term functions. The two terms $x\\cdot y$ and $y\\cdot x$ define distinct term functions (on non commutative groups or commutative monoids). Another example comes from boolean algebras (or more broadly lattice theory) where the two terms $x\\wedge (y\\vee z)$ and $(x\\wedge y)\\vee(x\\wedge z)$ define equal term functions on Boolean algebras (or more generally distributive lattices). If $t$ is a term then the associated term function on an algebra $\\underline{A}$ we let denote by $\\tilde{t} {\\underline{A}}$. Term functions are natural to express equalities within a theory. Now we are ready to formally define equational classes of algebras.\nFor example the class of monoids is an equational theory for $$\\mathbf{E}=\\bigl\\{(1\\cdot x,\\, x),\\; (x\\cdot 1,\\, x),\\; \\bigl((x\\cdot y)\\cdot z,\\, x\\cdot (y\\cdot z)\\bigr)\\bigr\\}$$ i.e. all the algebras with two operations: one of arity 0 (the unit) and one of arity 2 (the multiplication), such that the $1$ is the unit for multiplication $\\cdot $ and multiplication is associative. The class of commutative monoids is also an equational theory with one additional equation $(x\\cdot y,\\, y\\cdot x)$. Groups, Boolean or Heyting algebras, lattices are also equational theories.\nComing back to free algebras: it turns out that the set of terms $\\mathsf{T} {(f_i)}(X)$ on a given set of variables $X$ has an algebra structure of type $(f_i)_{i=1,\\dots,n}$: it is given by the inductive step in the definition of terms: if $t_i\\in \\mathsf{T} {(f_i)}(X)$ for $i=1,\\dots,j_i$ then $$ f_j {\\underline{\\mathsf{T} {(f_i)}(X)}}(t_1,\\ldots,t_{j_i}) := f_j(t_1,\\ldots,t_{j_i})\\in \\mathsf{T}(X) $$ Furthermore $\\underline{\\mathsf{T} {(f_i)}(X)}$ is a free algebra over $X$ in the class of all algebras of the given type $(f_i)_{i=1,\\dots,n}$. An extension of a map $h:X\\rightarrow\\underline{A}=(A,(f_i {\\underline{A}})_{i=1,\\ldots,n})$ can be build inductively following the definition of terms and using the homomorphism property: $$ h(f_i(t_1,\\ldots,f_{i_j})) := f_i {\\underline{A}}(h(t_1),\\ldots,h(t_{i_j})) $$ The map $h$ is indeed a homomorphism: $$ \\begin{array}{ll} h\\bigl(f_i {\\underline{\\mathsf{T}(X)}}(t_1,\\ldots,t_{i_j})\\bigr) & = h(f_i(t_1,\\ldots, t_{i_j}) \\\\\\\\ & = f_i {\\underline{A}}(h(t_1),\\ldots, h(t_{i_j})) \\\\\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Note that the class of algebras of the same type is usually very broad, but this is the first approximation to build free algebras in an equational theory. This is just the equational theory for the empty set $\\mathbf{E}$.\nLet s see this on an example and let us consider algebras of the same type as a monoid: with one nullary operation (unit $1$ or `mempty` if you like) and one 2-ary operation (multiplication / `mappend`). Let $X$ be a set of variables. Then $1$ is a valid term, and also if $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms on $X$ then also $t_1\\cdot t_2$ is a term, but also $t_1\\cdot 1$ and $1\\cdot t_2$ are valid and distinct terms. $\\mathsf{T}(X)$ resembles a monoid but it isn't. It is not associative and the unitality condition is not valid since $t\\cdot 1\\neq t\\neq 1\\cdot t$ as terms. We still need a way to enforce the laws. But note that if you have a map $f:X\\rightarrow M$ to a monoid $M$ which you'd like to extend to a homomorphism $\\mathsf{T}(X)\\rightarrow M$ that preserves $1$ (which is not the unit, yet) and multiplication (even though it is not associative), you don t have much choice: $\\mathsf{T}(X)\\rightarrow M$: $t_1\\cdot t_2$ must be mapped to $f(t_1)\\cdot f(t_2)\\in M$.\nWe need a tool to enforce term equations. For that one can use\nEquivalence relations and congruences form complete lattices (partial ordered which have all suprema and minima, also infinite). If you have two equivalence relations (congruences) then their intersection (as subsets of $A 2$) is an equivalence relation (congruence).\nThe set of equations that defines the class of monoids generates a congruence relation on the term algebra $\\underline{\\mathsf{T} {f_i}(X)}$ (i.e. an equivalence relation which is compatible with operations: $x_1\\sim y_1$ and $x_2\\sim y_2$ then $(x_1\\cdot y_1) \\sim (x_2\\cdot y_2)$). One can define it as the smallest congruence relation which contains the set $\\mathbf{E}$. Equivalence relation on a set $A$ is just a subset of the cartesian product $A\\times A$ (which satisfy certain axioms), so it all fits together! One can describe this congruence more precisely, but we'll be happy with the fact that it exists. To show that, first one need to observe that intersection of congruences is a congruence, then the smallest congruence containing the set $\\mathbf{E}$ is an intersection of all congruences that contain $\\mathbf{E}$. This intersection is non empty since the set $A\\times A$ is itself a congruence relation.\nThe key point now is that if we take the term algebra and take a quotient by the smallest congruence that contains all the pairs of terms which belong to the set $\\mathbf{E}$ we will obtain a free algebra in the equational class defined by $\\mathbf{E}$. We will leave the proof to a curious reader.\nLet s take a look on a free monoid that we can build this way. First let us consider the free algebra $\\underline{\\mathsf{T}(X)}$ for algebras of the same type as monoids (which include non associative monoids, which unit does not behave like a unit). And let $\\sim$ be the smallest relation (congruence) that enforces $\\mathsf{T}(X)/\\sim$ to be a monoid.\nSince monoids are associative every element in $\\underline{\\mathsf{T}(X)}/\\sim$ can be represented as $x_1\\cdot( x_2\\cdot (x_3\\cdot\\ldots \\cdot x_n))$ (where we group brackets to the right). Multiplication of $x_1\\cdot( x_2\\cdot (x_3\\cdot\\ldots \\cdot x_n))$ and $y_1\\cdot( y_2\\cdot (y_3\\cdot\\ldots \\cdot y_m))$ is just $x_1\\cdot (x_2\\cdot (x_3\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot(x_n\\cdot (y_1\\cdot (y_2\\cdot (y_3\\cdot\\ldots\\;\\cdot y_m)\\ldots)$. In Haskell if you d represent the set $X$ as a type $a$ then the free monoid is just the list type $[a]$ with multiplication: list concatenation and unit element: the empty list. Just think of\n-- A set with `n` elements corresponds -- to a type with `n` constructors: data X = X_1|⋯|X_n\n-- A set with `n` elements corresponds -- to a type with `n` constructors: data X = X_1|⋯|X_n\nIt turns out that monads in $\\mathcal{Hask}$ are also an equational theory. Just the terms are higher kinded: $*\\rightarrow*$ rather than $*$ as in monoids. The same construction of a free algebra works in the land of monads, but we need to look at them from another perspective. Let us first take a mathematical definition of view on monads.\nclass Monad m where return :: a -> m a join :: m(m a) -> m a\nclass Monad m where return :: a -> m a join :: m(m a) -> m a\nwhich is unital and associative, i.e. the following law holds:\n-- | associativity join . join == join . fmap join -- | unitality join . return = id = join . fmap return\n-- | associativity join . join == join . fmap join -- | unitality join . return = id = join . fmap return\nThese axioms are easier to understand as diagrams:\nIt is a basic lemma that this definition a monad is equivalent to what we are used to in Haskell:\nclass Monad m where return :: a -> m a >>= :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\nclass Monad m where return :: a -> m a >>= :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\nHaving `join` one defines ` =` as\nma >>= f = join $ f <$> ma\nma >>= f = join $ f <$> ma\nand the other way, having ` =` then\njoin = (>>= id)`\njoin = (>>= id)`\nNot only these two constructions are reverse to each other, but also they translate the monad laws correctly.\nTo define a monoid $M$ in the category $\\mathcal{Set}$ (of sets) one needs the product $M\\times M$.

The temperature was a brutally cold ten degrees, yet over a hundred thousand caucus goers endured long lines, confusing rules and poorly organized events to express their political will in the republican primaries. Just days earlier, many internal and some local polls showed Ron Paul performing admirably in a dead heat with Mike Huckabee.\nIt seemed as if the revolution's recent fundraising wins would translate into votes. It seemed as if the entire republican establishment was going to endure a defeat harsher than the wars they inflicted on the American people over the last eight years. Yet when the results came in, each percent point was like a dagger in the heart of the movement. The end tally was roughly ten percent support for a total around 11,000 people. Some rallies attracted nearly that many people. Somehow Huckabee attracted 4 votes for each of Paul's.\nIt seemed as if the harsh defeat was now reserved for the Paul movement. Some campaigners, exhausted from running the full grassley twice in just a few of months cried. Other responded with rage. Some argued that the vote had been rigged- afterall, the University commitments alone were 15,000 votes. One campaigner sat silently on an outside bench without a coat carrying a grave thousand yard stare for several hours. It was an easy time to feel hopeless. The remainder of the primaries didn't help.\nIn the aftermath, many wrote the Ron Paul campaign off as a populist anomaly. An internet era federation of John Birchers marrying the Austrians to return the American people to the 19th century's deflationary horrors and isolationism. How dare a campaign inflict the banality of historical reflection upon the American people! How dare he ask his fellow candidates to read books and think about the nature of money!\nThe appraisal couldn't be further from the truth. The contrarian arguments grew and now have created an entire generation of advocates who desire to end the fed, return to the gold standard, end foreign entanglements and embrace constitutional rights. In a more abstract sense, the contrarian always seems to be maligned, mocked and diminished; however, occasionally plants seeds that will eventually overcome whatever social paradigm they are fighting against.\nDr. Infinity\nAnother figure that comes to mind is Cantor. He is now regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the last few centuries including the company of Riemann, Euler and Gauss. Analogous to Paul's heresy of addressing the inconvenient and sensitive topic of monetary policy, Cantor dared to ask deep questions about the nature of infinity. He presented a diagonalization argument that demonstrated that while both the natural and real numbers are endless, they are somehow a different type of endlessness.\nThis work simultaneously led to extraordinary questions like the continuum hypothesis and to Cantor's dreadful consternation at his peer's sharp dismissals ranging from \"grave disease\" to \"scientific charlatan\". While he has been posthumously vindicated, the treatment by his peers and Cantor's subsequent nervous breakdown demonstrates the social consequences of dissent. As a final irony, there are now some mathematicians such as Norman Wildberger who are actually in the opposite position.\nValue of Dissent\nThe value of contrarians isn't in their efforts to win over the crowd with their counterarguments to the norm- many are in fact completely wrong. Their value is more significant than a policy change or a scientific retooling. The power of contrarian thinking is that it forces a more fundamental appraisal of the axioms and heuristics we tend to use to navigate life.\nFor example, in the heroic age of medicine, blood letting and cocaine laced mercury were the common notions. Allopathy challenged the entire basis for having these thoughts. The methodology itself was flawed and needed a change.\nOn the same token, Ron Paul's movement was an electoral failure, but a massive success in the thoughts about money. Value is starting to be viewed more socially and globally than siloed, institutionally enforced magical units of account.\nSome of Bitcoin's earliest and more ardent adopters were Paulites who already crossed the mental gap of seeing fiat for what it is- a social artifact. Now Bitcoin is a change engine forcing this humbling truth just by its continued growth and existence.\nLex Ex Machina\nSmart contracts seem to me to be another contrarian mental artifact. They are eating at the roots of the common notions of law. Who should enforce laws? What are contracts? What is intent? How should arbitration be addressed?\nWe have socially constructed answers to these questions forming a corpus of knowledges hundreds of years old. No human could ever appreciate the totality of opinion and elegance of such a construction much less a mathematician ever read and understand the entire proof of the classification of the finite simple groups.\nYet this system is becoming increasingly more expensive to maintain, riddled with inequities and requires legions of domain experts to just interpret its arcane wisdom. Is it moral to propagate a system that hurts the poor, drains society of resources and favors a rich minority to manipulate at a whim?\nWhether the effects of smart contracts have a real impact on commercial transactions and push us towards a private legal system for trade is as relevant as Ron Paul's loss. It's the attack on the fundamentals of the existing paradigm given alternatives that is much more meaningful. Contracts can become understandable open source, composable, templatable and in many cases don't require the heavy hand of government to resolve.\nThere is already a growing movement from Stanford's CodeX group to IBM's Ross providing AI driven legal assistance. As a corollary, I would be authorially negligent if I didn't mention Nick Szabo's recent writings on Wet and Dry code.\nCould we now be approaching a future where the government has a moral obligation to give us our own robot lawyer to interpret their Borgesian library of laws? Could we see people switching between legal systems as easily as multinational companies? Will we begin to expect an evolutionary nature in our legal system akin to the accelerating pace of technology? With the right contrarian artifacts perhaps.\nAn Artifact in Every Thought\nThe concise summary of my thoughts is that we live in a house of ideas, common notions, social conventions and biases inherited from people no smarter or better equipped than us. We cannot accept at face value their gifts and curses. We have an obligation to introduce contrarian artifacts wherever we can. In the attempt to destroy them, we will expose the naked truth of our constructed reality. It might not be pretty, but it always makes us better.\n4 August 2016 Charles Hoskinson 1 min read\n2 August 2016 Charles Hoskinson 14 mins read\nHoskus Parvum Opus, A Brief Sojourn Back to Ethereum - Input Output HongKong\nWe must never cease from exploration and at the end of all of our exploring will be to arrive at where we started and know the place for the first time.
