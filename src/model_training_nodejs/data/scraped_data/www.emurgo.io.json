    "prompt": "EMURGOs Drive to Support DAOs in Japan EMURGO?",
    "completion": "July 23, 2024\nEMURGO\nA previous blog on DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in Japan mentioned that the nation had put forth blockchain-related regulatory reform to provide official recognition to DAOs.\nThis marked a significant step at a national level to allow limited liability companies (LLCs) to start forming DAOs to raise capital in the form of NFTs.\nEMURGO, a blockchain technology company established in Japan in 2015, has been a supporter of Web3 adoption by organizations and businesses in Japan through local workshops. These have raised awareness on a variety of industry topics such as real-world asset tokenization, distributed blockchain governance, and other Web3 products & services.\nThis blog will further examine DAOs in Japan and EMURGO s activities to facilitate their adoption.\nJapan approved legislative reform that allows limited liability companies or LLCs to raise capital unlimitedly through an NFT (membership token) by deregulating the existing financial laws.\nThe potential benefits of this new DAO-related law include:\nThe Japan DAO Association was formed in Japan to assess legitimate DAO applications/projects and DAO-related tools for the public.\nThey act as an initial gatekeeper for Japan s growing DAO ecosystem, providing a necessary filter for other organizations and the public:\nThus far, this group has given preliminary approval to several DAO-related tools in the Cardano ecosystem and has recognized them as legitimate potential tools for DAO creation.\nRead more: Japan s DAO Association lists Yoroi Wallet, NMKR, and Clarity as DAO-related tools.\nDue to this preliminary approval in Japan, Cardano is pushing ahead to become an established network in Japan for DAOs. The DAO tools mentioned in this preliminary approval are:\nJapan s DAO Association mentions the need for a secure and tech-verified crypto wallet as it is considered a critical tool of DAO infrastructure.\nA digital token or crypto wallet provides basic and essential DAO functions such as enabling members to hold DAO membership tokens in the form of NFTs, providing voting power, signing transactions, and allowing various interactions between members.\nA DAO-approved crypto wallet also needs to be safe to use, as it is the cornerstone of the entire system. The seed or recovery phrase for the wallet needs to be random enough to be completely safe.\nThe wallet s private key must have strong encryption while being user-friendly for those unfamiliar with blockchain and crypto to easily and safely participate in DAO activities.\nBy being listed as one of the initial tools approved for DAOs, Yoroi Wallet s various user functions and features are considered to be an important DAO infrastructure piece that can be used by other companies and projects looking to form DAOs in Japan.\nThe next DAO tool mentioned by the DAO Foundation is a membership token or NFT that enables DAO members to know they are officially a part of a DAO and have access to its rights and obligations.\nIn most designs, the membership token is an NFT or non-fungible token held in a wallet such as Yoroi.\nThe NFT metadata contains and secures the relevant information regarding the DAO, individual members, and anything else deemed necessary to the DAO s function. This NFT token also serves to access a DAO s governance platform for members.\nNMKR is a Cardano NFT and tokenization platform built on the Cardano blockchain. It has all the necessary tools for DAOs to mint NFT membership tokens and tokenize company assets. NMKR s NFTs are also easily integrated with other popular digital token wallets in the Cardano ecosystem.\nRead more: How NMKR adds value to businesses and brands in the form of NFTs\nThe next tool given preliminary approval is Clarity, a DAO governance and treasury management system. It provides a platform with tools for other DAOs to use to publish proposals, track voting power, transparently show voting results, and provide its users with control over the shared resources.\nClarity is a DAO tools platform that is native to Cardano.\nThe project provides a way to register the policy ID used for voting for a DAO, a space to publish proposals, set up voting rounds, and manage the treasury.\nIt s a complete solution for those wanting to launch a DAO on the Cardano network.\nTo advance with the final approval, some details still have to be finalized.\nFirst, there needs to be localization as the tools above must provide a Japanese interface and documentation.\nThe second is to eliminate fraud scenarios through a wallet multi-sig implementation to prevent any one person or member from manipulating DAO funds.\nJapan s newly formed DAO Association held a DAO awareness in-person event last month, in Takamatsu, Japan to discuss how DAOs could accelerate regional development by making it easier for local businesses to raise capital and market their products or services.\nIt included the participation of over fifty companies and individuals looking to set up a DAO in the country, including Hirai Takuya, the ex-digital minister of Japan.\nEMURGO, NMKR, and Clarity participated to present their insights and technology to the gathered audience.\nRead more: Coindesk recap of the event (Japanese)\nIn the long run, the larger objective is to kickstart the effort to attract new DAO initiatives to Japan through increased awareness and collaboration. Ultimately, this can help grow the native DAO ecosystem, particularly by utilizing the readily available tools of the Cardano ecosystem.\nWant to learn more about Web3 in Japan?\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for more related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "Why Decentralized Blockchain Governance is Important Cardano EMURGO?",
    "completion": "July 2, 2024\nEMURGO\nWith more emphasis on decentralization and distribution within blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps), governance has become an important topic of discussion.\nMore users of blockchain ecosystems and their dApps want to learn how decisions are made that can impact their sustainability and governance.\nThe Cardano blockchain aims to become the first truly decentralized and distributed blockchain with a community-run governance model.\nTo achieve this, the Cardano community has been working out the details of CIP-1694 to implement a distributed on-chain governance model maintained and updated by the community.\nIn addition, a member-based organization, Intersect, has been launched with Committees and Special Interests or Working Groups to support the implementation of CIP-1694. Discussions have also been held on the Cardano Constitution, the test network for governance (SanchoNet), and relevant tooling features to use on SanchoNet (GovTool), among other things.\nThis blog will further discuss the importance of decentralized governance and its importance to the future sustainability of a blockchain such as Cardano.\nRelated reading:\nDecentralized governance is a style of decision-making and administration in which division and dissemination of central authority, activities, rights, and responsibilities are spread around several institutions or members within an organization, network, or group.\nDecentralization can happen at several levels of governance.\nSometimes, local governments can be decentralized under a centralized national body or vice versa.\nIn any case, there are different models of decentralization.\nIn most cases, however, decentralized governance is applied to support democratic state-run, municipal governments, grassroots governance, or public services.\nDecentralized governance ensures the delegation of power and authority. It helps to empower local-level administrative wings by incentivizing active public participation in shaping decision-making for their community.\nCompared to centralized companies, organizations, or applications administered and run by a few core stakeholders or developers, a blockchain network run by its community can have several advantages that bring more transparency, democracy, and accountability to the entire network.\nIn a decentralized governance framework, the people or the users will have decision-making power through open proposals, collective voting, access to essential records, and more.\nIf this is applied to a blockchain network, important proposals, votes, and other records can be stored transparently on-chain.\nThe developers and users that make up the community will be devising and deciding on how to sustain the network over time, as opposed to a centralized model in which a few core insiders may be incentivized to act in their interest without thorough accountability. It s a natural way for a system of checks and balances.\nNow, through open-source blockchain technology such as Cardano, users on a global scale can vote, store records, propose ideas, tokenize assets, transact, and a whole lot more instantly.\nThis empowers and enables the community of users to grow together and truly decide on what is best for the network.\nCardano s model for decentralized governance is different from other networks because it uses different governance institutions and a form of liquid democracy. There are three main bodies:\nIn a liquid democracy, members or users can share their votes and support specific policies rather than relying on representatives who may be subject to other interests. In this type of system, delegates are repositories of voting power. The moment they cast their vote, they do it with the assigned voting power on a case-by-case basis. With this system, the Principal-Agent Problem is reduced since, at any point, a delegate can lose all of their voting power if the users perceive their voices aren t being reflected.\nCardano also has a separate off-chain member organization, Intersect, to support decentralized governance initiatives for its sustainability. Intersect organizes committees and groups to work on certain tasks related to Cardano s evolution and decentralization. Anyone can join Intersect by registering on its website.\nRead more: Explaining the bodies in Cardano governance\nIntersect is the main anchor for participation.\nPeople can join in on the different aspects of shaping Cardano governance via this organization.\nAdditionally, Intersect will help to lead the drafting of the Cardano Constitution through its committees and groups.\nA Cardano Constitutional Convention will also be held to present the draft of the Cardano Constitution for community ratification.\nWant to receive more information about Cardano governance and Intersect?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other blockchain governance-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

It has been designed from inception to be environmentally friendly and offer an open-source blockchain platform to host decentralized applications that can provide accessible economic services to the world.\nMay 25, 2023\nWatch the Cardano whiteboard overview\nByron\nFoundation\nShelley\nDecentralization\nGoguen\nSmart Contracts\nBasho\nScaling\nVoltaire\nGovernance\nByron\nFoundation\nNamed after George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron or Lord Byron as he was known, was an English Romantic poet. The Byron era is the first era of the Cardano blockchain, and the kickstart of the entire Cardano blockchain.\nThe actual start of Cardano can be tracked back to 2015, as the founders of Cardano identified three blockchain-specific challenges to solve: scalability to onboard more users and improve blockchain throughput, interoperability to integrate functionalities and features with other systems, and sustainability for Cardano to last for generations.\nIn order to solve these challenges, a new open-source, decentralized blockchain network needed to be designed and developed.\nWith that objective, the Byron era officially began in September 2017 with the launch of the federated era of Cardano. In this era, the founding entities of Cardano would establish the basic infrastructure for Cardano including launching the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus protocol to enable transactions, developing user wallets, facilitating exchange listings for its native cryptocurrency ADA, and building the worldwide Cardano community.\nIn Cardano, important upgrades are implemented via a hard fork combinator (HFC) event, a technical term used to indicate the combination of certain processes or things. In this case, a HFC merges protocols, thereby enabling the smooth transition of Cardano without blockchain network interruption or restart.\nThe Shelley era as mentioned above transitioned Cardano to a decentralized network and was marked by the Shelley hard fork.\nThe Mary hard fork started the multi-asset support of the Cardano blockchain. During the Byron and the start of Shelley eras, ADA was the only asset on the Cardano ledger.\nThe Alonzo hard fork introduced smart contracts to Cardano with Plutus, the Cardano blockchain s smart contract programming language which is based on Haskell.\nVasil is a continuation of the upgrades from Alonzo and also belongs to the Goguen era.\nHydra is the creation of state channels in Cardano. It is a Layer-2 scalability solution for Cardano, which aims to increase the speed of transactions and minimize transaction costs.\nKen Kodama\nFounder and CEO, EMURGO Group\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

    "prompt": "How to Get Started With Cardano NFTs A Basic Checklist EMURGO?",
    "completion": "October 10, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) have rapidly emerged as a new digital asset class, built on the secure and transparent infrastructure of blockchain technology. They ve onboarded many users outside of cryptocurrencies to start engaging with decentralized networks, serving as a key entry point for many into the world of Web3 and blockchain. As one of the first blockchain-based assets to gain widespread mainstream adoption and resonate with popular culture, NFTs have become an increasingly popular topic of discussion.\nFor those considering minting or creating an NFT on Cardano, this guide is for you.\nA leading decentralized blockchain network with millions of users, the Cardano blockchain network offers a unique technical platform that has a growing NFT ecosystem of marketplaces, projects, and wallets for creators and collectors alike.\nIn this blog, we ll walk you through a basic checklist to help you get started with tokenizing assets and issuing NFTs on the Cardano blockchain.\nThe first step in your Cardano NFT journey is to set up a Cardano-based crypto wallet. This kind of crypto wallet is essential for storing your Cardano (ADA), NFTs, and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Cardano blockchain.\nIt is a user s gateway to the entire Cardano blockchain ecosystem of projects, marketplaces, and other dApps. Since these wallets tend to be self-custodial wallets where the user must download and set up their wallet s private key, they provide the security and functionality needed to manage your digital assets. The wallet s owner must always abide by wallet security best practices and safely manage and store their wallet s private key. If the private key is lost or compromised, the user could lose access to the assets in the wallet.\nChoosing the right wallet is critical. NFT users will want a widely adopted Cardano wallet that offers strong security features and compatibility with the dApps on the Cardano network. Since NFTs are typically purchased and managed through on-chain dApps, opting for a wallet that functions as a browser extension can be seen as a popular choice.\nYoroi Wallet is one such option that provides a secure, self-custodial wallet in a desktop web browser and mobile versions. Developed by EMURGO, it enables users to send, receive, store, and stake ADA as well as interact with on-chain Cardano applications. It also offers fiat on-ramps to purchase ADA as well as an NFT gallery while ensuring that a user s private keys are encrypted for added protection.\nRelated reading:\nThe next step in a user s Cardano NFT journey is to possess ADA, the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano network. ADA is essential for creating NFTs, as NFTs must be minted on-chain, and the associated fees must be paid in the network s cryptocurrency. It s important to possess enough ADA to cover these minting costs before launching an NFT.\nSome platforms, such as NMKR, offer a solution that allows businesses and creators to mint Cardano NFTs without directly purchasing cryptocurrencies. It also removes the technical barrier to issuing NFTs as users can simply upload assets and the platform will tokenize them as NFTs.\nHowever, it s still important to hold some ADA as this ensures users can cover other network costs, such as transaction fees, which are necessary for interacting with the Cardano blockchain.\nAfter purchasing ADA on an exchange or through Yoroi, users can deposit it into their self-custodial Cardano wallet to prepare to engage with the ecosystem.\nOnce a self-custodial Cardano wallet has been set up with some ADA, the next step is to decide how to mint NFTs. One approach is to create a custom smart contract that handles the minting process, but this can be time-consuming and may require specialized development skills.\nAs mentioned above, a more efficient alternative for most non-technical users is to use a Cardano NFT minting platform that manages the on-chain work.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service built on the Cardano blockchain. It offers a variety of robust tools and features to customize NFTs without the need to hire dedicated smart contract developers, making it an ideal option for projects looking to streamline the NFT minting process.\nRead more: How NMKR maximizes brand impact for businesses and projects through NFTs\nOnce an NFT has been successfully minted on the Cardano blockchain, it s important to secure a more permanent storage solution that safeguards the NFTs while still allowing them to be easily traded on-chain.\nFor advanced users, a hardware wallet or cold wallet is essential. A hardware wallet stores NFTs and cryptocurrencies offline in what s known as cold storage, significantly enhancing security by keeping your assets disconnected from the internet. This minimizes the risk of hacks and unauthorized access as long as best practices are followed.\nYoroi, an open-source and self-custodial wallet for Cardano users, is also compatible with Ledger, a hardware wallet, and gives users the flexibility to choose the option that best meets their needs.\nRead more: Explaining the different crypto wallet types\nUsers can also sell their NFTs by visiting popular Cardano NFT marketplaces with a steady stream of visitors, increasing their chances of finding buyers for their NFTs.\nSome places like NMKR offer a native fiat on-ramp via NMKR Pay, allowing users to purchase NFTs using traditional payment methods. This eliminates the need for potential buyers to worry about cryptocurrency transactions, broadening their market reach.\nRead more: What is NMKR Pay?\nNMKR facilitates the seamless tokenization of assets by making the NFT minting process. Its user-friendly platform accommodates formats like images, videos, and audio. Additionally, it extends support to files such as HTML, 3D files, and PDFs, providing a wide range of NFT creations.\nWant to learn more about NFTs and their use cases beyond just images?

    "prompt": "How Intersects Committees and Groups Support Cardano Governance EMURGO?",
    "completion": "October 8, 2024\nEMURGO\nIntersect is a member-based organization (MBO) that supports the continued growth of a decentralized and inclusive Cardano blockchain network governed by its community.\nAs such, it must find ways to reflect the community s voices and incorporate their ideas into maintaining and sustaining the network s operations.\nTo meet this objective, Intersect comprises various Committees and Working Groups that provide opportunities for community members to take on desired roles and accomplish certain goals related to distributed governance.\nIn this blog, we ll explore further how these bodies collaborate.\nStanding Committees are permanent organizations composed of Intersect members. Each Committee decides how to add new people to its ranks. Some do so via applications, while others do so via invitation.\nEach committee has a dedicated open Discord channel where anyone in the Cardano community can interact with members.\nJoin the Intersect Discord channel\nAt the moment, there are seven committees:\nEach committee is in charge of several Working Groups (explained below) to whom they assign certain tasks and a timeframe for completion.\nThe list varies as some Working Groups cease to exist after completing their assigned work, and others are created to solve new problems. Generally, the Technical Working Groups are aligned with similar Standing Committees, while the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) also work with the non-technical Committees.\nRelated reading:\nCompared to the Committees, the Working Groups are more accessible to the average community member. They are arranged around a specific topic and are assigned tasks that must be delivered within a certain time frame. They are divided into two categories:\nThese are groups familiar with the technical aspects of implementing a blockchain network, including cryptography, the topology of the nodes, transaction size, etc.\nThese groups get specific tasks or deliverables and a set deadline from a Committee by which they must complete the given objectives. In some cases, this may require the allocation of a budget.\nThese Working Groups are open to anyone in Cardano. However, their technical nature makes them more suitable for community members with a deep background in Computer Science, Network engineering, or similar fields.\nOthers can still join and use the meetings to learn more about Cardano, but it would take time before they could meaningfully contribute technically to finishing a product.\nThese are groups that tackle other important operations that could be more technical. These could be translations, marketing, business development, and other related activities. Each one is under the wing of an Intersect Committee, which can assign a task to an SIG. At that point, the SIG becomes a Working Group.\nOnce the members have finished their task, their status as a Working Group ends, and they return to being a SIG. For example, a language allocation SIG can be given the task of translating Intersect s documentation to Japanese.\nIn this case, the SIG is renamed the Japanese Translation Working Group (or something similar) and begins its task. After they finish translating, they return to the original SIG until they are given a new objective.\nAny Member can request to be part of a Working Group by contacting them through their Discord channel.\nJoin Intersect now and start shaping Cardano governance\nTo receive more information on Cardano governance and Intersect, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "How to Store, Send, and Receive Cardano NFTs EMURGO?",
    "completion": "October 3, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens are among the most innovative digital assets to come from blockchain technology. They have created a whole host of business use cases and raised awareness amongst the public about the potential of Web3.\nYet, many are still unfamiliar with the abstract nature of NFTs and find it rather difficult to send, receive, and store them.\nIn this blog, we will look at some of the common ways to address these issues for individual users and those involved with tokenized assets minted on the Cardano blockchain.\nFor NFTs issued or created on the Cardano blockchain network, core developers have created a native asset standard. This makes them similar in properties to fungible tokens or Cardano s native cryptocurrency ADA, and more versatile and easy to send, store, and receive.\nThe process of creating and issuing the NFT on a blockchain is known as minting. For those directly minting on Cardano, it can be a more technical process that requires a Cardano Node (a server connected to the blockchain) and other requirements. Platforms such as NMKR aim to address that barrier by enabling anyone to use their service to tokenize assets by minting Cardano NFTs without having to possess those technical requirements.\nAll information related to the asset in the Cardano NFT is also stored in the token metadata which can store more data than compared to NFTs issued on other chains. Certain Cardano-based wallets such as Yoroi can pull the metadata from the native assets to display the NFT in its intended form in its NFT gallery feature.\nRead more: Swap Cardano native assets in Yoroi Wallet\nFor NFTs minted on Cardano, a self-custodial Cardano ecosystem wallet such as Yoroi (and others) enables users to store and display their NFTs.\nWith Yoroi, there is a desktop web browser and a mobile version available.\nThese wallets allow users to create a private key upon installation. Most of these are considered self-custodial wallets where the user retains control over their stored assets since only they have access to the wallet s private key.\nThese wallets also have NFT gallery functions that allow for a fast search of a user s NFTs to view or trade. That makes them very convenient to connect with and use in NFT marketplaces and other platforms.\nHowever, a potential vulnerability is that the user must be aware of security best practices in safeguarding their digital assets. A user without much experience or knowledge of safely securing their private key could become an attractive target for hackers.\nRead more: Ways to avoid popular scams with Yoroi.\nThis is something to consider since if the private key is breached or lost, there is no way to recover access to the wallet.\nUsers can send and receive Cardano NFTs directly from their Cardano-based wallet such as Yoroi or others with a NFT gallery.\nThese can be sent directly to another person s wallet or another wallet that you own. Others can send NFTs directly to your wallet.\nIt is required that a user must have a Shelley-era Cardano wallet address which indicates it is not an exchange wallet. These wallet addresses start with the prefix addr1 .\nWhen sending a Cardano NFT, users must also have enough ADA to cover the cost of sending the asset. To send, a user must go to the Send function in their wallet, enter the correct wallet address of the recipient and fee amount displayed, and verify their wallet spending password.\nTo receive a Cardano NFT, a user must provide their Shelley-era wallet address to the sender.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service that leverages the Cardano blockchain.\nIt facilitates the tokenization of real-world assets by making the NFT minting process straightforward and user-friendly. Its platform accommodates typical formats like images, videos, and audio. Additionally, it extends support to application files such as HTML, 3D files, and PDFs, providing a comprehensive range of NFT creations.\nOther services such as NMKR Pay enable those minting NFTs to also utilize traditional payment options to streamline the process instead of having to resort to using cryptocurrencies.\nRead more: How businesses can leverage NMKR for NFTs\nWant to learn more about NFTs and their use cases beyond just images?

    "prompt": "Cardano NFT Case Study NMKR and Book.io EMURGO?",
    "completion": "September 26, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe book publishing industry has evolved significantly since the 1990s, yet many traditional practices still limit the rewards authors can reap from their work.\nBook.io is building the future of book ownership. It is at the forefront of changing this by leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionize how books are published and distributed thereby changing the game for its authors and owners.\nAs one of the pioneering NFT projects on the Cardano network, Book.io has demonstrated the power and potential of decentralized publishing.\nNotably, they were among the earliest adopters of NMKR s NFT minting platform, showcasing a new frontier for digital assets in the literary world.\nLet s discuss how this partnership has brought unique value to book authors and owners.\nBook.io is an NFT project using the Cardano blockchain network to decentralize books and knowledge. It achieves this by enabling books to never deteriorate while at the same time being able to be sold or transferred across the globe in seconds without permission.\nAccording to its website:\nIn 2017, Cofounders Joshua Stone and Ben Illian were brainstorming about the future of digital books and media. Then, Josh asked a question that would chase them until the launch of Book.io on July 22, 2022: What if we truly owned our digital books? What if we owned our eBooks and Audiobooks like we owned our physical books? At the time, it was just a question, but one they returned to often. By 2021, it became a daily discussion that turned into an obsession. This was a problem that needed to be fixed.\nIn the current digital book distribution model, an e-book is not owned by the person who buys it. The platform is the owner of the media and it extends a license to the final user. It means that those who purchase an e-book do not completely own the book, but rather have access to read it as they wish. As it stands, there are several middlemen involved in the process from book authorship to viewership.\nRelated reading:\nBook.io uses the power of the distributed ledger to change this dynamic. It gives authors control over their creations and also empowers buyers to truly own their e-book purchases and be able to sell them to others. There is much more of a direct link between authors and readers with fewer middlemen involved.\nTo do this, Book.io publishes digital books as NFTs using the NMKR platform. Not only is the cover of the book represented as an NFT, but the whole e-book is part of the token.\nAs a result, e-book owners can freely use their NFTs. After they are done reading the book, the NFT can be resold on the open market. In some cases, the price can be higher than the original one.\nBy using NFTs, authors can maintain full ownership of their work before any sale.\nThis contrasts with traditional distribution models where digital publishers often control key aspects such as the timing of the book s release, its visibility, and even pricing. This leaves authors with limited control over their creations.\nHowever, with Book.io s model, authors can retain the majority of the sale proceeds and have the autonomy to set their own retail prices, giving them far greater control over their work s distribution and value.\nThis also opens up new potential strategies for those aspiring to be writers.\nTraditionally, used book sales have been a point of contention between publishers and authors, as these sales don t typically generate royalties for the writers. As a result, many authors have been hesitant to engage with the used book market.\nWith Book.io s model, however, authors can earn royalties even on secondary sales, bridging the gap between primary sales and the used book market, and providing authors with ongoing revenue streams from their work.\nAuthors can utilize innovative strategies to promote their books through Book.io. For instance, they can create special edition covers as rare NFTs, which can be sold at a higher price. These unique editions can not only attract more interest in secondary markets but also result in potentially higher royalties for the author, providing an additional revenue stream and increasing the value of their work.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service built on the Cardano blockchain. In their quest to tokenize and sell e-books, Book partnered with NMKR to use its API and harness the power of the Cardano blockchain.\nTo date, Book.io has successfully sold hundreds of thousands of NFTs and released more than 70 titles, showcasing its ability to revolutionize the digital book industry, create true ownership for readers, and a new distribution model for authors.\nThe tokens are not public NFT images of book covers but are fully Decentralized Encrypted Assets (DEAs). This means the token itself is the entire book, fully decentralized and living on-chain in the Cardano network.\nAre you interested in asset tokenization and NFT usage on Cardano using NMKR?

In its place, there is an interim Cardano Constitution that is part of the first Chang Hard Fork upgrade and can be viewed here. It is a temporary document that will serve to bootstrap Cardano s governance era and help in the transition to the enactment of the official Cardano Constitution.\nThe expected timeline is for the Constitution to be drafted and presented by delegates at the Cardano Constitutional Convention for a community vote.\nTo reach that point, the community is hosting a series of constitutional workshops around the world with the support of Intersect to gather various opinions and insights that should be included in the draft.\nRelated reading:\nThe drafting of the Cardano Constitution will be the culmination of a process that started more than a year ago, it began with CIP-1694 and in-person CIP-1694 workshops. CIP-1694 is a Community Cardano Improvement Proposal outlining the on-chain tools, features, and other governance-related focuses needed to govern Cardano effectively.\nIntersect, a member-based organization supporting the distributed governance of the Cardano blockchain, has organized dozens of global workshops in different countries to discuss matters related to the Constitution. These are ongoing in the latter half of 2024.\nOnce the workshops have concluded, all their feedback will be collected so every community member can access it. These important insights will be used to draft the first version of the official Constitution later at the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires, Argentina (December 2024).\nFeedback from these workshops can be found here.\nThese workshops will also discuss the choice of local delegates for the convention. These delegates will then participate in workshops at the Convention to prepare the Constitution s first presentation.\nAfter a series of workshops at the Convention, the final draft of the Cardano Constitution should be ready for the community to ratify. The entire Cardano community will have time to review it and process the information contained in the document.\nThe community will come together to either approve the document or reject it.\nIf approved, the text of the Cardano Constitution will be hashed and added to the Cardano network. Every stake pool in the network will have a copy of the Constitution, and the hash will be made public so everyone can review it.\nThere are different stages to the Cardano Constitution:\nRead more: What is the interim Cardano Constitution?\nTo receive more information on Cardano governance and Intersect, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

In most cases, a buyer needs to go to an exchange and buy it before doing the NFT purchase.\nIn the case of NMKR Studio, it is fully capable of processing fiat payments in Apple Pay, Google Pay, and credit cards for an NFT. This reduces the friction for each purchase as users can directly buy with their preferred traditional payment method.\nNMKR Studio offers extensive customization options for selling NFTs, empowering creators to manage their collections and exert some control over how buyers purchase them.\nKey customization features include:\nManaging token metadata is a crucial aspect of creating an NFT, as it includes key conditions and relevant data about the asset in text form. With NMKR Studio, creators can easily write and automatically attach this metadata to their tokens. Additionally, NMKR Studio allows metadata to be updatable, enabling creators to modify it in the future for specific use cases.\nNMKR Studio also supports both CIP-25 and CIP-68, the primary metadata standards for the Cardano network. While CIP-68 can be challenging for newcomers, NMKR simplifies the process, reducing it to just a few easy choices on the platform.\nRelated reading: How CIP-25 enables the concept of Dynamic NFTs\nFinally, NMKR Studio enables all of this functionality to be seamlessly integrated into a custom page. Brands looking to create their NFTs no longer need to rely on external platforms that divert traffic to separate websites. With NMKR Studio, the platform integrates directly into the creator s project, not the other way around.\nThis empowers brands, businesses, and creators to design their campaigns while retaining full control over their message.\nWant to learn more about NFTs and how they can transform businesses?\nDiscover the benefits and explore practical use cases with our in-depth insights and weekly blog content.\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to get regular updates.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "5 NFT Use Cases for Data Beyond Traditional Images EMURGO?",
    "completion": "September 12, 2024\nEMURGO\nWhen NFTs (non-fungible tokens) became a prominent trend a few years ago, they were mostly known by the mainstream as a type of digital art or image that somehow used blockchain technology to create and store them.\nFor most people, the image and the NFT were the same.\nHowever, this perception oversimplifies its range of unique properties. Images are in fact, just one type of file that can be linked to it. They can digitally store and represent much more than just image files.\nIn this blog, we will discuss 5 other data types that can be minted as NFTs beyond just simple images.\nAn NFT is a digital token issued by and recorded on a blockchain network with a unique ID. This identifier makes it possible to differentiate one token from another as they are transacted over the network. They typically represent some type of asset to make it easier to store, trade, and authenticate in the digital world.\nNFTs can be minted or created using a platform service such as NMKR and the token itself can be stored within crypto wallets.\nIn the Cardano blockchain, an NFT is identified by the Policy ID which gives it a unique cryptographic fingerprint and value on-chain. This can be used for a single token, or for a token collection where each token shares the same identifier but with unique names.\nThe URL of the associated media type is recorded in the metadata of the token. In most cases, it points to a distributed storage network that records it. The images of NFTs are in these networks, but they can store more than just an image.\nA sound recording can be recorded on a decentralized storage network similar to an image file. All the properties associated with visual data would also apply here.\nAn example can be sound effects.\nMany sound engineers create sound effects which then can be used for videos, movies, games, etc. In this case, the NFT of the sound effect could be used to represent and enable the purchase of its license so that it may be incorporated into other works.\nAnother example is music.\nMany musicians have found traditional streaming services to provide royalties that are too insignificant to reasonably sustain a music career. NFTs representing songs and music albums could be used to market individual songs directly to consumers and potentially provide higher royalties along with integrated payment options.\nRelated reading:\nPeople live in a world where satellite-based real-time maps provide coverage of nearly any location on Earth. Smartphones equipped with mapping applications give access to people to find certain places, connect and share specific location-based information with others, and more.\nBeyond just general maps, this comprehensive coverage has been used for applications such as mapping farmland, oil fields, city planning, and even games.\nNFTs can take a certain location on a map and make them unique. The metadata can create a collectible based on a location which then gives rewards to the person reaching a certain destination.\nThis function can be then used to create location-based campaigns and services within games, exercise apps, and many other business or recreational activities to incentivize users to go to certain locations.\nLegal agreements or contracts that bind two or more parties into a set of rules and stipulations can also be represented and recorded on-chain as an NFT. These would direct the outcomes based on certain conditions happening in the world.\nThis means each NFT would contain a text file that is recorded on a distributed storage network. The blockchain network that issues the NFT would have the ability to read token metadata and assign outcomes based on the information.\nA contract deployed using an NFT would not only be a legal agreement, but it would also be self-executable logic that enforces results based on conditions that are met thereby creating faster business operations and enhanced transparency.\nToday s online games are populated by thousands of items. Each of these goods plays a role in the game s mechanics. These attributes are contained in a server and are kept there under the control of a few hands.\nAn NFT can represent an in-game item and also contain the attributes of it in the metadata. The metadata can be mutable or immutable, it would be up to the game developer, but everyone would be aware of any changes made.\nThe combination of in-game items and NFTs with versatile metadata can create a new level of utility for games at large. Blockchain provides a secure medium and options for those developing a game while providing security to gamers.\nEach NFT can also represent a piece of a large film, an episode of a series, a short film, or in some cases, an issue of a comic where turning the page is an animated action.\nThe NFT can then be used to access this film or animation and watch it or purchase it. This allows the owner to resell it later on NTF marketplaces if they no longer desire access to the media.\nThis can open a new type of distribution for those looking to create and distribute short-form film media to content creators or other media-related businesses.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily create NFTs by providing tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established platform, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets.\nIts various products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support enable businesses and individuals to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even provide traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nWant to learn more about NFTs and their use cases beyond just images?

    "prompt": "What is the Japan DAO Law? EMURGO?",
    "completion": "May 29, 2024\nEMURGO\nDAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations have shown the potential to organize economic activity, allocate investments, fundraise, and other organizational functions in a more efficient way.\nLeveraging blockchain technology, DAOs are a new type of online-based human organization or entity that is self-running with its own set of rules and conditions.\nOver the past few years, the talks of and interest in DAOs have become more commonplace as blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have gained widespread attention in the news.\nYet, while blockchain and certain cryptocurrencies may be starting to be understood at a basic level by a technical and non-technical audience, the topic of DAOs is still relatively new.\nOne major obstacle to increasing its awareness has been the opaque or lack of regulatory frameworks surrounding DAOs and also the greater blockchain industry.\nThus, companies, developers, and individuals interested in forming a DAO tend to be reluctant to invest resources and time to build a DAO due to legal uncertainties.\nHowever, this tendency may be shifting as more governments are starting to embrace the expansion of blockchain-based Web3 technologies and services such as a DAO. In particular, Japan has introduced discussions on forming a framework for DAO integrations and has taken the first step among major nations to support its growth.\nThis blog will further discuss the basics of DAOs, their use cases, and how Japan is attempting to pave the way for commercial DAO adoption.\nA DAO is a type of online-based entity in which decision-making powers lie within a group of its members. In the DAO model, no central authority chooses how to allocate resources, distribute revenue, hire new personnel, etc.\nThe DAO makes these choices as a whole and then these are executed by the entire organization. As such, a DAO can represent the interests of the community and have the force of legitimacy since a majority of its members have approved its decisions.\nRead more: What are some DAO-related trends?\nTo achieve this vision, a DAO requires several pieces of Web3 or blockchain-based technologies:\nFor example, Yoroi is an open-source and self-custodial Cardano blockchain wallet that allows for all the crypto actions mentioned above and also interfaces with other Cardano-based DAO tools. This makes it a direct tool that a Cardano-based DAO and its members could use.\nOther pieces that are not required but useful to have include:\nRelated reading:\nSo, what is the potential of a DAO and its potential implications for businesses, organizations, and individuals?\nAs mentioned, a DAO is a new type of digital institution that can be used to organize human activities and be self-run with a set of blockchain-based digital tools at its disposal to ensure effectiveness. It takes decisions collectively through its members and decides how to best carry out activities to meet its objectives.\nIn many ways, it s like the cooperative model in which the workers of the organizations are also the owners and make decisions collectively when needed. The main difference is that a DAO opens this model on a global scale.\nCooperatives have problems scaling beyond their local regions because they don t provide a way for people to vote from all over the globe. They don t scale beyond their regional borders and are outcompeted by larger companies.\nA DAO can have the same, or even better, voting mechanisms than a cooperative and this can reach a global community. Anyone can become part of a DAO from anywhere via the instantaneous digital properties of blockchain technology.\nDigital tokens give voting power to every member and blockchain networks allow the members to track the resources of the DAO. The community not only chooses but also verifies the actions are being taken as per the original vote.\nThe transformative power of DAOs is already creating new ways for people to create self-run digital organizations. Some examples are:\nAs mentioned at the start, the legislation of most countries has been slow to adapt to the concept of a DAO due to a lack of awareness, political reasons, and other high-agenda items.\nHowever, Japan has been making moves to support the growth of Web3-related initiatives such as DAOs.\nRecently, Japan approved a new law that allows limited liability companies or LLCs to raise capital unlimitedly through an NFT (membership token) by deregulating the existing financial laws.\nAlso, Japan s DAO Association has been formed to promote the awareness, development, and implementation of DAOs nationwide. It will also act to safeguard users and organizations by filtering DAO projects and tools for legitimacy.\nIn the past, DAOs that operated in countries that did not recognize them ran the risk of running afoul of local laws and regulations.\nThis posed a major obstacle when it came to administrative business processes such as renting office space, accessing loans, raising money, hiring staff, or even paying taxes. DAOs had to try to use some existing laws, such as cooperatives, and try to adjust their legal status as best they could to operate legally.\nNow in Japan, there is potential for this new DAO-related law to:\nNew to DAOs or want to learn more about their potential?\nEMURGO is a global blockchain technology company with a focus on building blockchain infrastructure, providing blockchain education, and investing in Web3 companies.\nFollow EMURGO on X for more about DAOs and other Web3-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "completion": "September 7, 2021\nTogether Agency\nDownload Yoroi Wallet here\nOne of the reasons why cryptocurrencies are so powerful is that users have total ownership of their assets if kept off an exchange.\nA crypto wallet in reality only points to the record of the blockchain ledger that shows the coins and tokens owned by a person or user, and the wallet itself does not hold the crypto assets.\nOf course, this means each user is responsible for managing and securing their own cryptocurrencies.\nTo do so, many crypto wallets use a recovery key phrase, which is a series of random words that can be used to recover the private key of a wallet.\nIn some cases, a user forgets his/her spending password (separate from a recovery key phrase) and is locked out of their wallet, or needs to regenerate their wallet for another reason.\nThis is when knowing how to recover your crypto using a recovery key phrase is important.\nIn this blog, we will explain how to use the recovery key phrase to restore your funds on Yoroi Wallet a light wallet for Cardano ADA users.\nSince many recovery key phrases tend to be between 12 and 24 words, memorizing all of them can be a challenge.\nEspecially since the words need to be in the original order to work as a recovery mechanism.\nAs a reminder, do not:\nInstead, offline is the best way to do it:\nEMURGO a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain and developer of Yoroi Wallet receives many user questions on how to recover a Yoroi Wallet and has laid out the basic steps here to assist users.\nThe name and passwords do not have to be the same as the ones used before.

However, due to the somewhat technical nature of NFTs, many people still do not fully understand what an NFT actually is.\nFor example, if anyone is able to simply right-click on the NFT to copy it, what value does it have?\nAll those misconceptions originate in the idea that the NFT is the visual asset attached to the token.\nIn short, an NFT is technically nothing more than an entry into the blockchain ledger that uses a unique identifier in the form of a cryptographic hash to make sure it cannot be duplicated.\nRegular fungible tokens do not have individual unique IDs, so they are interchangeable among each other. The NFT when recorded into the ledger comes with this unique identifier which permits its verification as a single entry into the recorded ledger or blockchain state.\nThe piece of artwork represented by the NFT can be an image, GIF, MP3, or even a video file.\nThe associated art is not present anywhere on the blockchain.\nIn fact, it would be prohibitively expensive to store large amounts of data on a decentralized network both in dollars and memory allocation. It is suboptimal, as the data would have to be copied thousands of times on nodes across the network while adding little to the usability of the token.\nThe artwork associated with the NFT is normally stored on a server providing this as a service.\nArtworks are referenced in the NFT via a link that points to the location where that piece of media is stored.\nFor NFTs, metadata is as crucial as the immutable blockchain ledger entry, and the external media, but often it gets overlooked in the discussion.\nBehind every NFT, there is the concept of metadata, which is a description of the attributes of the token that are independent from the entry on the ledger.\nMetadata is used by NFT marketplaces to show information about the token on their sites.\nThe metadata is pinned by returning it as a hash to the minting NFT smart contract.\nAn example of this metadata can look something like this:\n{ \"name\": \"Sleeping Cat\", \"description\": \"You opened the box and found a sleeping cat. Looking at it one cannot help but feel at peace.\", \"image\": \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeWK2BwtsEsSmRDMwmwCT5PADbyku2Xik5sXtsVQVC9Gw?filenam e=HE-SLEEP.jpeg\", \"attributes\": [ { \"trait-type\": \"EigenValue\", \"value\": \"HE SLEEPS\" } ] }\n{ \"name\": \"Sleeping Cat\", \"description\": \"You opened the box and found a sleeping cat.

This PolicyID is singular to each asset on Cardano.\nThe PolicyID originates from the minting script that defines properties of a token, such as who can mint, the supply, and others.\nNFTs are among the most dynamic assets in the blockchain industry.\nCardano has managed to implement their own version, the CNFT, by extending the unique properties of native assets.\nAs a result, CNFTs are more secure, easy to mint, and cheaper to use than other alternatives.\nEMURGO is uniquely positioned to leverage its extensive knowledge of Cardano s technical development to offer curated educational courses on Cardano to interested students.\nAll courses are taught by professional instructors with actual blockchain experience.\nEMURGO Academy, EMURGO s education unit, has now expanded to offer numerous courses on Cardano to a range of student types interested in becoming a Cardano developer, becoming a Cardano entrepreneur, becoming a Cardano business analyst/consultant, and more.\nFor more information on each of the courses and to contact a representative, please visit the link here now!\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - October 10, 2024\nKnowledge - October 8, 2024\nKnowledge - October 3, 2024\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

NMKR has amassed a large following in the Cardano ecosystem through its mission to enable brands and users to easily issue NFTs and adopt Real-World Asset Tokenization on Cardano.\nIn this blog, we ll dive further into NMKR, its capabilities, and how brands and businesses can maximize their mainstream commercial impact by using NMKR s platform for NFTs and asset tokenization.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization service on Cardano that aims to bring Web3 to the masses through its simplicity. It s an easy-to-use application geared toward artists, brands, and web developers to allow them to create and sell Tokens or NFTs with as little friction as possible.\nThe platform uses an API architecture for its technical foundation. Anyone can use the API to mint Tokens or NFTs without requiring technical knowledge or any complex blockchain logic. It aims to be a user-friendly minimum code solution that broadens NFT adoption and brings more businesses and individual users into Cardano.\nThe current stats of NMKR are very impressive:\nThis makes NMKR one of the biggest decentralized applications and services on Cardano and a major player in the blockchain industry. It still has a lot more room for growth and is preparing to unveil some major products in the future to accelerate Cardano NFT and asset tokenization adoption.\nNMKR already offers a very complete and simple toolkit to issue NFTs. Let s go over some of the products NMKR currently offers, and discuss their utility, and benefits for those looking to start getting into NFTs.\nNMKR Studio is a platform for businesses & creators to launch & manage their own NFT & Tokenization projects. Examples include:\nBusinesses can issue NFTs for the reasons above, generate new revenue streams, and reach a new group of users interested in Web3.\nThe platform makes creating NFTs easy by enabling the uploading of images, configuring metadata, providing a payment option, and whitelisting wallet addresses.\nRelated Reading\nThe NMKR Studio API (Application Programming Interface) is a tool that integrates the functionalities of the NMKR Studio into web pages created by third parties. The API uses the HTTP Get and Post Requests and invokes NMKR s Server-Side code to run the minting logic.\nThe API brings all the power of NMKR Studio to the websites of those creating a project. All the tools created for NMKR Studio are then provided for the site of the project via the API. This allows for the seamless integration of Tokens and NFTs into any project without the need to have blockchain-specific developers on staff.\nAnother tool NMKR offers is a fiat payment solution to purchase NFTs. Most people don t have a cryptocurrency readily available when looking to make a purchase. This adds the hassle of having to access and create an account with a crypto exchange, deposit money, and turn it into a cryptocurrency. After, they would have to go back to the site that sells the NFTs and finally make the payment.\nAll these steps are streamlined with NMKR Pay, as it allows for direct fiat payments. In this way, the user can use their normal payment method and instantly buy the NFT from other users or brands. The steps are just reduced to a single one and the sale of NFTs is expedited.\nNMKR also provides the ability to set up royalty payments on NFT resales and can also be integrated with Airdrops, Holder Management & Secondary Sales API.\nCreators of the NFT collection can set up a payment wallet address where an amount of the resale price is deposited every time an NFT in the collection changes hands.\nThis can give a continuous revenue stream for a longer period. The money can be substantial when an NFT collection becomes popular and resales happen frequently. Another way projects can complement their income sources.\nThis has immense potential for individual creators and businesses with popular intellectual property they would like to tokenize.\nOn top of NMKR Studio as the underlying infrastructure, NMKR is currently building a Real-World Asset Tokenization Launchpad called finest.\nThis platform will allow users to easily invest in previously high-entry barrier asset classes like real estate, high-value art, and more.\nThe NMKR platform is a complete suite of tools for those looking to enter the NFT & Tokenization market. After describing all the things it has to offer, it s very easy to see how NMKR can fit in any strategy by a brand new to the blockchain space.\nThe great thing about NMKR is that it provides all the code to mint, make payments, and set up royalties for NFTs in an API form. Brands don t need to give up control over the visuals of the product as NMKR integrates seamlessly in the background without having to get blockchain developers.\nThe brand creators can focus on the feel, look, and utility of the NFT & Token collections allowing NMKR to run in the background without any worries. This makes NMKR one of the most versatile solutions for the NFT & Tokenization ecosystem on Cardano.\nAre you an EMURGO and NMKR follower?\nInterested in keeping up-to-date with the latest from EMURGO s partnership with NMKR?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to receive updates about the partnership and future initiatives with NMKR to drive Cardano NFT usage for asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "5 Ways to Participate in Cardano Governance With Intersect EMURGO?",
    "completion": "June 11, 2024\nEMURGO\nIntersect is a member-based organization (MBO) that supports Cardano s distributed community governance.\nLaunched in 2023, Intersect s objective is to transition the Cardano blockchain network towards a fully distributed governance structure whereby the community is responsible for the network s technical maintenance and sustainability.\nAnyone or any organization is eligible to join Intersect and help shape Cardano s governance and plans.\nWhile it is still early, Intersect is already an extensive organization with over 1,150 members.\nAs Cardano is in the process of shifting to this distributed governance model and has many ways to contribute, it is difficult for the average user or organization to start engaging with Cardano governance via Intersect.\nIn this blog, there is a short guide on five ways to get started with Intersect.\nRelated reading:\nThe first step is to join Intersect.\nMembers must register to start participating in Cardano governance. It s important to register as soon as possible, as there is a growing need for new members to join the conversation.\nRegistration also grants access to Intersect s Discord channel, the main channel for communication and discussion for members. An invitation is extended only once a person or organization has registered to join.\nOnce there, multiple channels, an event calendar, and other discussion threads are opened for the members. It s an integral part of the Intersect organization and the primary entryway for future activities.\nThe next step to engage more with Intersect is joining a Working Group.\nThese are groups of Cardano community members that join to discuss specific topics. Each Working Group is focused on one or two governance-related topics, so the discussion remains limited.\nThere are no requirements to join a Working Group. All of them are open to anyone who wants to join. Of course, some Working Groups are more technical, like the Developer Experience Working Group, while others focus on non-technical topics, such as the Marketing Working Group.\nThis means there is a Working Group for everyone in the community. Those with more technical skills will find a place in technology-minded groups, while those more interested in communications will have a place in the others.\nThe Working Groups are the backbone of Cardano s future. They discuss many important topics that will later shape the direction of the network, which is why being part of those discussions is crucial.\nOnce a month, Intersect holds a town hall open to all its members.\nIt s a chance to receive all the latest Cardano governance updates, learn which grants were awarded, attend future events, network, and receive other Intersect-related news.\nThe town hall also provides a chance to ask questions directly to the Intersect community and all members. Additionally, in the meeting, the members running the Working Groups often appear and present their latest work, asking for feedback and suggestions or even for new members to get involved.\nThe town hall is held remotely over a video conference so anyone can attend.\nAnother great way to participate in Intersect is to host events. Intersect members can provide help with information and other material to introduce Cardano to new entrants. It also helps with Intersect membership, as events are a great channel to get more members.\nEvents are also important to help spread the word about Cardano. The network will need new members to grow and become more self-sustaining. Intersect is focused on expanding Cardano adoption through broader awareness, decentralized applications, education for developers, and more.\nThe goal is for a large self-sustaining blockchain network with various decentralized applications, significant user adoption of these applications, various stakeholders securing the Cardano network, active governance participation, an increasing number of Cardano-proficient developers, enterprise adoption, etc.\nAnother important step is to apply for a grant. Many grants are available, and more will be launched later this year. A grant is a great way to be known by the greater Cardano community and help the network.\nGrants are not only technical; some address event organizing, education, and other topics. The grants are given in ada, so some risk management is necessary when planning to finish one.\nWant to receive more information about Cardano governance and Intersect?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "What You Need to Know About SanchoNet Cardano EMURGO?",
    "completion": "March 5, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe Cardano blockchain provides a fully decentralized and distributed blockchain ecosystem for decentralized applications (dApps) as well as a community-run governance system. This governance system has gone through several workshops to build awareness and discuss community feedback and is going through its development phase on the road toward full community governance.\nThis aspect of community-driven governance of the Cardano blockchain is at the heart of the Voltaire era, one of the major phases of the initial Cardano roadmap.\nBuilding a self-sustaining and community-focused governance framework is a complex matter involving several different technical and non-technical parts such as on-chain governance features, network and wallet integrations, off-chain member organizations, a Constitution, governance bodies, and more.\nThree concepts are at play in this answer:\nSanchoNet: The technical development of Cardano s self-governance takes place in a specialized test network named SanchoNet. This test network aims to comprehensively implement the CIP-1694 specifications in a simulation environment.\nSanchoNet GovTool: This is a website that allows the Cardano Community the chance to experience now some of the governance features described in CIP-1694.\nCIP-1694: It s a set of governance guidelines that came as a result of a series of global workshops organized by the Intersect MBO.\nSanchoNet s main focus is to build and introduce governance mechanisms and feedback from Cardano s CIP-1694 into a controlled testnet environment. It serves as the backbone of the Cardano community regarding the experimental implementations of Cardano s on-chain governance activities taking place right now and in the future.\nThe use of SanchoNet to test Cardano s community governance is not only a technical proposition but also one that requires a lot of work off-chain such as technical committees, informational tools, information localization, education, and more. SanchoNet is a truly collaborative effort between Cardano s off-chain aspects and its on-chain technical requirements to achieve community-run governance.\nFor this reason, SanchoNet is meant to be a testbed network for the governance requirements of Cardano. As more discussions and workshops are held and more community feedback is received, it will change as new community needs for governance are identified. Cardano itself as a network is constantly going through updates and new technical developments, many of which need to be considered as part of its governance model.\nThere are different actors in Cardano s governance, including the stake pool operators (SPOs), delegate representatives (DReps), the Constitutional Committee, and ADA holders. All of them can test its developing governance model at a technical level. The community will be able to see how these tools are being implemented in a test phase.\nAs such, much of the success of building Cardano s governance framework and SanchoNet depends on the feedback and involvement of the Cardano community.\nRelated reading:\nThe SanchoNet allows for the testing of various roles that are fulfilled by people and organizations in the Cardano community. Each has a crucial part to play in shaping the future of Cardano governance and the evolution of the Voltaire era. Some of these main roles are:\nTest-ada holders: SanchoNet is a test network, so it utilizes test-ADA. The holders of this type of ADA are the ones crafting and submitting governance actions. These holders are the engine that proposes the changes the other actors must consider.\nSPOs: SPOs need to register specifically to the SanchoNet test network and are the ones that vote using delegation to stake pools. The SPOs vote with the test-ADA delegated to test the voting mechanism of Stake Pool Operators.\nDReps: DReps aggregate the decision-making of the network by having test-ADA holders give their balance and voting power to a DRep. By exercising the right to vote with their accumulated test-ADA, the DReps approve or reject governance proposals.\nDevelopers: SanchoNet is not a fully realized test network. The project still requires a lot of work and here is where developers can aid. These are a group of individuals who create wallets, blockchain explorers, and other tools that connect to SanchoNet.\nThe team behind SanchoNet has created a portal for those looking to simulate the governance of Cardano, but don t have the technical expertise to connect to SanchoNet. The portal offers roles for ADA holders, DReps, and for creating governance actions.\nThe website for the portal is https://sanchogov.tools/. In it, Cardano users can:\nRead more: What is SanchoNet GovTool?\nThe portal simulates the experience of participating in the governance model outlined in CIP-1694. It remains an evolving tool that with time it ll be able to offer more opportunities to test the concepts outlined in the governance model of Cardano.\nThe SanchoNet test network is being deployed in stages that each increase functionalities to the Cardano ecosystem. Some of them are already live, while the rest are coming shortly. Let s review these stages:\nPhase 1: SanchoNet opens itself to users and opens to submit new constitutional governance actions and for SPOs to vote on these actions.\nPhase 2: Focused on increasing community participation by enabling test-ADA holders to register as DReps, delegate voting power to other DReps, review governance actions, and vote as DReps.\nPhase 3: Expands the submission and voting of governance actions and increases information about them.\nPhase 4: Introduces the Constitutional Committee and its different states such as motion of no-confidence and treasury withdrawal actions. At this point, it will be possible to elect Constitutional Committee members.\nPhase 5: Allows governance actions to dictate protocol parameter updates. This dramatically changes the power of governance.\nPhase 6: Opens the governance actions to be the initiators of a hard fork for the network.\nPhases 1 through 4 are live on the SanchoNet test network. The rest are expected to happen shortly and be ready for the broader governance discussions.\nFollow EMURGO on X\nAre you looking for a simple way to receive Cardano governance updates and more about the Cardano ecosystem?\nThen, click above and follow EMURGO on X.\nEMURGO is a global technology company with a mission to facilitate commercial adoption of the Cardano blockchain through partnerships with existing ecosystem partners and new entrants to Web3.\nBy prioritizing investments, delivering continuous education, and building infrastructure, EMURGO s goal is to unlock the full potential of the Cardano ecosystem.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "The Basics of CIP1694 Cardano Improvement Proposal?",
    "completion": "June 1, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nWith the Cardano blockchain having grown its ecosystem of users and applications over the past several years, the focus has now shifted to Cardano s decentralized governance policies to ensure its future sustainability.\nAs a decentralized blockchain, Cardano was meant to always eventually be governed by its community.\nCIP-1694 is a discussion proposal that represents the first concerted effort in delivering on this promise. It plays a crucial role in shaping the future of Cardano and brings another major upgrade for the Cardano community.\nLet s review all you need to know about CIP-1694 and what it means for the Cardano community.\nCIP-1694 is a specific Cardano Improvement Proposal. It is a formal document from the Cardano community that contains specifications and organizational notes about topics related to on-chain governance for Cardano including Cardano native tokens, new standards for on-chain improvements, and any changes proposed for the Cardano protocol, among others.\nIt follows a previous system from the internet called a Request for Comment (RFC). The process starts with an initial draft. It can be created by a single individual, a small group, or a large organization. The draft document is taken by the Cardano community to review, improve, and then revise for any mistakes or to make it more complete. Anyone in the world can volunteer to read up on draft CIPs. Some topics are technical and require blockchain knowledge; others are community proposals.\nThose who volunteer to review CIPs meet bi-weekly and publish summaries of all discussions in a dedicated GitHub.\nThe meetings happen on a Discord server that anyone can join via this invite.\nFinally, the meetings are recorded and also published on a YouTube channel maintained by the Cardano Foundation.\nThe entire process is meant to be as inclusive and transparent as possible for anyone in the Cardano community to participate. The CIPs are the most direct way for an ordinary Cardano community member to contribute to the future of the Cardano blockchain and get involved with others in the community.\nOne of the CIPs attracting the most attention at the moment is CIP-1694 and its implications for the Voltaire era of Cardano, the final development period.\nCIP-1694 was named after the birth year of Voltaire, and it is the main focal point around the start of Cardano s Voltaire era. This means that CIP-1694 will start to form the governing bodies of the Cardano protocol including a Constitutional Committee, Delegated Representatives (dReps), and SPOs, and create voting policies and other governance details about Cardano.\nThe governance mechanism will be introduced in stages and then gradually become more complex. Not all of the decisions regarding Cardano will immediately be given to the community, and the process will take time to fully finish.\nAlso, at the moment, the proposal is very much experimental and is subject to many debates and discussions from the various stakeholders in the Cardano community including developers, holders, academics, stake pool operators, and others.\nThe governance of a decentralized protocol such as Cardano has never been attempted in this scope and thus, there are many things to discuss regarding how the pieces will work together.\nFor this reason, the governance rollup will be an iterative process. In it, changes introduced will first be on a trial basis. After, there will be a period of study and interpretation to see how the changes are performed at the Cardano protocol level.\nThis careful approach will ensure the Cardano community, developers, projects, and other stakeholders have enough time to adjust. Also, it will allow the Cardano ecosystem to correct any ideas that didn t work as expected or implement other changes that were suggested during the trial.\nThe first body to oversee the governance of Cardano will be called the Constitutional Committee. It ll ensure that the Cardano Constitution is followed and that it is updated according to a process.\nThe Cardano Constitution itself is still in the discussion stage. There is no official published document for it, but it ll become the foundation of all future Cardano governance decisions and the main item used as the foundation of the Voltaire era.\nThere was a pilot CIP-1694 workshop held in March 2023 in Colorado, USA and there are more CIP-1694 workshops planned throughout the year. Some workshop dates have been announced including ones in Tokyo, Japan; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Zug, Switzerland that will be hosted by EMURGO, IOG, and CF.\nCIP-1694 aims to give every Cardano community member a say in the future direction of Cardano. The Cardano Constitution will be the foundational document, and every member will be able to show their preferences by voting on-chain. This way, the Cardano community will be involved in the decisions that shape Cardano s future.\nAdditionally, there will be several roles open for governance. There will be membership to the Constitutional Committee and to the Delegated Representatives (DReps) which will be aggregators of voting power and ultimately be able to cast votes. Finally, Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) are one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions by voting.\nThese roles will be the way people can take charge of the Cardano network. People from all over the globe can become Committee members or DReps.\nOnce CIP-1694 is confirmed and running, Cardano will be in the hands of the community. This means the Constitution Committee, Dreps, SPOs, and other community members. Collectively, all of them will be able to make proposals, have them be presented for a vote, and if successful be implemented.\nThe Cardano network will become the first decentralized blockchain protocol controlled and run by its community which will be significant.\nThe vision for a decentralized ecosystem running on open-source blockchain technology and governed by its community will become a reality.\nWorking closely with Cardano ecosystem partners and projects, EMURGO is committed to the development of the Cardano ecosystem for the global community.\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - October 10, 2024\nKnowledge - October 8, 2024\nKnowledge - October 3, 2024\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

    "prompt": "An Introduction to Liquid Democracy in Cardano EMURGO?",
    "completion": "July 6, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nDemocracy has been the model governance system in the West for around three centuries. There are different types of democracy including Liquid Democracy. Democracy is among the most successful governance systems in human history and remains, in many parts of the planet, the standard in free, developed societies. It enables people to express their opinions and be a part of the decision-making process in the communities and countries they are a part of.\nIn this context, it seems natural that decentralized blockchain networks with their large number of users, should also adopt democratic principles. As a blockchain network grows, governance and the proper allocation of network resources become a priority to ensure fairness, transparency, and sustainability as a decentralized blockchain is run by its users.\nSo it begs the question:\nIs democracy truly the best system for a decentralized blockchain?\nIn this blog, we ll discuss this question and its implications.\nA deceptively simple question at first, democracy is one of the most studied systems on the planet. There are whole books devoted to its understanding, countless lectures, and entire university specializations centered around this topic.\nFor this reason, it would not be possible to make an exhaustive presentation of what is democracy in the confines of a single basic article. The subject will have to remain on a general level that discusses democracy at large and not the many variations that exist today.\nRegardless, we can still conclude why liquid democracy is being considered for the governance of the Cardano blockchain.\nPlus, we can discuss the criticisms of how democracies operate in the current world.\nA dictionary definition of democracy would be:\na system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. (Powered by Oxford Languages)\nWe can see that there are two different types of democracy in its simplest dictionary definition. One where the people of a State govern directly, or one where representatives make decisions: Direct Democracy or Representative Democracy.\nDirect Democracy was adopted by the relatively small city-states of Greece with Athens as the most famous of the group.\nIn a Direct Democracy, the citizens of the political unit gather in a location and discuss the subjects at hand. There is a vote to decide any matter which then is chosen directly with no intermediation by proxy agents.\nThere are debates before the vote, where opposing factions can elaborate on the merits of their positions. Oratory is one of the most valued skills in such a system, as explaining the subject of the vote convincingly was crucial for success.\nDirect democracies tend to be suited for small political institutions as it requires direct participation by those who are deemed as part of the system and are more likely suited for smaller groups of people.\nBecause it requires direct debate and voting, direct democracy is not feasible in many modern societies with large populations. This is what gave rise to our next example, Representative Democracy.\nRepresentative Democracy is founded on the idea that individuals cannot decide directly and choose representatives to govern for them. The representatives are separated into different governing bodies and these have term limits.\nAgain, Representative Democracy is a complex topic that can t be explained in a short article. But, the most important feature of it can be discussed and used to unravel its implications. In this case, society as a whole, is governed by a small group of elected officials.\nAs a decentralized network is composed of many participants with larger blockchain ecosystems having millions of users, Direct Democracy seems impossible.\nFurthermore, Representative Democracy appears to fit more appropriately to the task at hand and should be adopted.\nBut we know there are many problems with it and perhaps it is not suited for this new type of organization, a decentralized blockchain network.\nThe critics of Representative Democracy are numerous and varied. Many aspects can be put into question, and scholars from all over the world do it in their collective works.\nIn this blog, we ll focus on one problem with the ideas of representation which comes from the world of Game Theory The Principal-Agent.\nThe principal-agent problem is a conflict in priorities between the owner of an asset and the person to whom control of the asset has been delegated. [1]\nIn the case of a Representative Democracy, the elected officials are the agent while the electorate is the principal. At first, it seems their best interest is to govern on behalf of the electorate. Yet, their position allows them to accumulate more information and resources by acting against the general interest or the people that directly elected them.\nFurthermore, the period where they can be made accountable, an election, is very short and happens after long intervals. For this reason, once a representative is chosen and becomes part of the government, his/her incentives to fulfill promises drop dramatically.\nThe mismatch between the electorate and the elected only grows over time, especially if there are no term limits for the officials. The result is corruption and a disenchanted society that no longer trusts the system.\nThe Principal-Agent Problem in Representative Democracies is one of great complexity. There are many discussions about how deeply it affects a society, or even if it can be used as an analytic tool.\nBut to govern a decentralized blockchain, there might be a different choice altogether.\nAlso known as a Delegate Democracy in certain literature, it s a new type of democracy where citizens are permitted to share their votes and support specific policies rather than having to rely fully on representatives that are subject to other interests. By moving around their allocated power, citizens in this system can directly impact policies. It s sometimes called Delegate Democracy because the power rests more in the hands of the delegates rather than on representatives.\nIn this type of system, delegates are repositories of voting power. The moment they cast their vote, they do it with the assigned voting power and do it on a case-by-case basis. In one instance, some representatives may have expertise in infrastructure, so citizens delegate more voting power to them, and trust their knowledge.\nOn other matters that require different expertise, such as social policy, other delegates might be more suited, and the citizens move their power accordingly. In a way, the delegates voting power is mutable and changes and adapts to circumstances.\nWith this system, the Principal-Agent Problem is reduced since at any point a delegate can lose all of their voting power if the citizens perceive a poor performance. In a way, Liquid Democracy has elements of Direct Democracy, as citizens directly impact how voting power migrates, and also Representative Democracy as the delegates vote according to their expertise.\nIt marries both concepts and leverages decentralized blockchain technology to make it all happen. For this reason, the Cardano blockchain has taken on Liquid Democracy as the system chosen to govern Cardano for this precise reason.\nIt s both adaptive and representative and marks a true departure from previous systems of government. In Cardano, liquid democracy is a pillar of the Voltaire era. It focuses on decentralized on-chain governance of the Cardano blockchain by its community of developers, academics, organizations, stake pool operators, and other individuals.\nIn an upcoming blog, we ll dive deeper into the Liquid Democracy design for Cardano and also discuss the different subsystems and the process to roll it out onto the network.\nEMURGO supports the adoption of Cardano and blockchain technologies by building Web3 solutions on Cardano, educating blockchain developers, investing in blockchain startups, and informing Cardano enthusiasts on the latest developments in the Cardano ecosystem.\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "Explaining the Bodies in Cardano Governance EMURGO?",
    "completion": "July 11, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nIn a previous blog, we covered the basics of the concept of Liquid Democracy in Cardano blockchain governance.\nIn this blog, we ll elaborate more on how the Cardano blockchain has set up roles for the Constitutional Committee, Delegated Representatives (DReps), and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) to integrate Liquid Democracy and its advantages for on-chain decentralized governance.\nFirst, we have to keep in mind that decentralized governance is a new experiment and is being developed with the input of the community.\nIt has not been attempted at the scale of a system like Cardano with its millions of global users and there are no real case studies.\nFor these reasons, all the details presented here are subject to change as more discussion continues within the Cardano community in its Voltaire era.\nAs the realities of Liquid Democracy applied to a decentralized blockchain like Cardano become more apparent, adjustments will be made along the way to continuously upgrade governance mechanisms.\nIt s important to keep in mind that this is just the starting point and that the future goal is to have a smoothly-run governance structure of Cardano that is decentralized and accessible to everyone.\nThe outlines of the Liquid Democracy model are being discussed worldwide in the CIP-1694 workshops. The results will shape the first iteration of what will be the first decentralized government model for a blockchain, especially one of Cardano s scale.\nIn the current model, there are already some institutions outlined that will become the backbone of the Liquid Democracy system.\nThe objective is to focus on two of them and give more details on their inner workings while we also briefly look at the SPOs (Stake Pool Operators).\nThese two governing bodies we ll describe are accessible to anyone in the Cardano community. Their power and legitimacy come from the fact that they are completely open. They will be in charge of much of the operations of the government and also direct the future of the governance model.\nTheir roles are extremely important and a lot rests on the shoulders of both these institutions. The name of the two bodies is the Constitutional Committee and the Delegated Representatives (DReps). Let s unpack them both.\nIn short, the Constitutional Committee is defined in the current CIP-1694 document as a committee which represents a set of individuals or entities that are collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitution is respected.\nThe Cardano Constitution is being discussed to become the document that will guide the governing principles for the Cardano network. At the moment, there are only drafts of it and it s very much under discussion, but once there is an established document, the Constitutional Committee will be in charge of enforcing its principles.\nThe members of the Constitutional Committee have to vote on any decision that affects governance and decide if it goes against the Constitution. It cannot create new initiatives, nor as of its current design, modify the once presented for a vote.\nThe Committee decides whether a proposal goes against the Cardano Constitution. It s a binary vote, which is meant to preserve the rule of the Constitution over the entire network.\nThe Constitutional Committee will be instituted initially for the first interaction with members of the Cardano community and then it ll change as the governance model advances.\nThe number of members has not yet been decided. It s expected that the number will change over time and be any non-negative number. At some points, there may be more members than at a previous stage. So, the committee won t ever have a fixed number of participants.\nThe members also don t have to be only individuals. It s expected that some members will represent whole entities that are corporations, groups, or other forms of collective institutions that support the Cardano network.\nThe Constitutional Committee can be considered as having two states: a normal state and a state of no-confidence. In the first one, it means the committee is working as expected and it s operating normally.\nThe second state signals that it has lost the backing of the community and must be replaced.\nThe other two governing bodies of Cardano, the DReps and the SPO Council, are the ones that determine if the Constitutional Committee is in a state of no-confidence.\nThe threshold of the vote required by the other two bodies has not yet been decided. The result of the vote can be the complete or partial replacement of the Constitutional Committee.\nThe Constitutional Committee won t have periodic elections. This means that the individual committee members will each have different expirations for their mandates. The members will each be replaced once their terms are concluded and this can happen many times during a year.\nAs of now, the new members have to be voted by the SPOs and the DReps to be confirmed to the Constitutional Committee. The threshold has not been decided, nor what is the nominations procedure for new members.\nDelegated Representatives are registered members of the Cardano community who can receive the delegation of voting power. Individuals have voting power by the amount of ADA each control. These can be delegated to a registered DRep and used as voting power as well.\nEach DRep votes with all the ADA delegated to them when deciding on the proposals up for a vote. The ADA can be migrated from DRep to DRep at any point, or broken down and one person can delegate portions of their ADA to different DReps.\nIn the same way, ADA delegated to a pool is not transferred, ADA delegated to a DReps does not change ownership. The ADA always remains in control of the original individual.\nAny member of the Cardano community can register and receive a DRep ID. This means they can receive the delegation of the ADA holders. Registration is the only requirement to become a DRep and what determines the influence of any one DRep is how much voting power is accumulated by them.\nThis means there is no set number of DReps although details are subject to discussion. At any point, the number of active DReps can increase or decrease, as ADA holders migrate their voting power from different representatives.\nAgain, there are no term limits for the DReps. An active DRep has a non-negative amount of voting power and is voting on different proposals. The non-active ones are those who retire their DRep ID and no longer accept voting power delegation. Finally, there can be unsuccessful DReps who have an active ID but no voting power.\nAs voting power migrates and is delegated to different DReps. In some cases, a single DRep can see all the voting power moved to another DRep for a while. The DReps are a flexible body of representatives that are meant to adjust to the needs of the network.\nFinally, we have the SPOs or Stake Pool Operators. They are the second voting block on the Liquid Democracy model. They use the ADA delegated to their pool as voting power and use it to choose among any proposals under consideration.\nAnyone who has an active stake pool on Cardano can vote, but it s possible to abstain. The number of SPOs and the amount of ADA delegated to them is the voting power of this institution.\nFor now, those are the different institutions meant to take up the governance of Cardano. Each of the three bodies is meant to balance the other and give a voice to the ADA holders as a whole.\nAs we said at the start, the current model is very much in the early stages of planning. The CIP-1694 workshops are collecting feedback from all over the world and once the first cycle is over, much of this design will be modified.\nThe road to a fully self-governed Cardano network is a long one. Each step must be carefully considered and enough information has to be gathered to make changes. This journey we ll be a rewarding one and the entire community must participate to make it successful.\nEMURGO supports the adoption of Cardano and blockchain technologies by building Web3 solutions on Cardano, educating blockchain developers, investing in blockchain startups, and informing Cardano enthusiasts on the latest developments in the Cardano ecosystem.\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "What You Need to Know About Cardanos Voltaire Era?",
    "completion": "May 25, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nThe Cardano blockchain is one of the largest open-source and decentralized blockchain networks in crypto with a huge global community. Cardano has evolved from its inception by going through many technical upgrades to now being on the cusp of getting handed over to the community for governance moving forward.\nWith so much distributed development happening in Cardano including DeFi protocols, wallets, NFT dApps, stablecoins, and more, the global Cardano community is starting to address decentralized blockchain governance policies with the support of Cardano founding entities EMURGO, IOG, and The Cardano Foundation. These policies will settle Cardano voting policies, procedures, and other governance details for ADA holders.\nDecentralized blockchain networks ultimately aim to be democratic and community-run with its members deciding voting policies and procedures that affect how it is run in the future.\nThis naturally leads to the question of:\nhow to effectively govern such a massive decentralized global network with millions of users and thousands of running applications?\nThis is the key question that Cardano s Voltaire era, the final era in its roadmap, aims to answer.\nBelow, we will address this key question and further details you need to know about Cardano and Voltaire.\nCardano is an open-source decentralized blockchain and is the first blockchain to be designed and built according to scientific methods. It also uses an environmentally friendly proof-of-stake consensus protocol to power and secure its distributed network which consumes much less energy than other networks. The entire Cardano blockchain is around 60,000 times less energy intensive than Bitcoin [1].\nBy using programmable smart contracts, Cardano is not only able to validate transactions between people but also, self-executing contracts that process once programmed conditions are met. This means that certain financial products, for example, can be easily and securely launched using smart contracts.\nThe Cardano blockchain aims to be a scalable, interoperable, and sustainable blockchain that provides accessible economic services to all by being a platform that hosts decentralized applications for finance, digital property, identity, records, and more. It is scalable to be able to process a large number of transactions, interoperable with other blockchains and data systems, and sustainable for generations through robust governance policies.\nCardano s innovative proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called Ouroboros powers its decentralized blockchain that provides users with low transaction fees with fast settlement times, a sustainable economic model, and the ability to scale and evolve with users having more control over the future of the network.\nWith this unique emphasis on scalability, interoperability, and sustainability using scientific peer-review methods to engineer Cardano, the ecosystem has been growing exponentially since its launch in September 2017 with millions of users worldwide.\nWith the technical foundation set for Cardano, the final topic for the Cardano community to address is decentralized governance.\nVoltaire is the final building era of the Cardano roadmap. From the beginning, Cardano s development has been divided into several eras with each focusing on a different part of its technology. The Voltaire era deals with its governance by the community.\nIt is important to note that the development eras of Cardano are not happening in sequential order, but are happening in parallel due.\nCardano smart contracts, for example, were introduced as part of the previous Goguen era, but improvements and other optimizations to them are still ongoing.\nThe first steps in the discussion about Cardano s future governance are underway with the community as the focus with support from EMURGO, IOG, and Cardano Foundation. As governance details will also influence the future direction of Cardano smart contracts, scalability solutions, side chains, and other solutions, the community must be involved.\nThe two main aspects that Voltaire and Cardano s governance aims to address are voting and treasury systems.\nVoting is to ensure that the correct priorities are chosen by the community. The treasury systems deal with how to manage the financial resources of the Cardano network.\nThere will be three pillars in Cardano governance:\nGovernance is a critical piece of any community-based system. Most of the crises we have today have to do with failures in effective governance systems from deadlocks in legislatures, corporate corruption, economic instability, and more. Many of these are caused by poor governance systems.\nThis impact of bad governance systems has also previously been felt by the blockchain industry. One of the most important early community governance failures was the fight for the data size of a Bitcoin block. One side wanted to update the block size to about 5 megabytes to account for the increased use of the Bitcoin network. The other wanted to maintain the original 1-megabyte space and do some workarounds to fit more transactions.\nIn the end, neither side could convince the other, and the Bitcoin network was divided into two different blockchains Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Other forked versions came later which goes back to the idea of sustainability. Cardano is designed to prevent these sustainability issues by coming up with a fair governance system to last generations for a large user base.\nThus, Voltaire is critical to make the Cardano network a sustainable project by creating a dialogue with different stakeholders including ADA holders, Cardano developers, SPOs, and others. As more projects continue to launch on Cardano, many start having different priorities regarding which technologies to deliver first, where to allocate grants, which market to focus on, and many more.\nA proper governance system will help to allocate resources efficiently by revealing the preferences of the participants.\nVoltaire is addressing these points and starts the discussion on how to best deliver a representative system for an international network that can have millions of users.\nBy now you may have realized how crucial the Voltaire era is for the future sustainability of Cardano. Many projects stumble when they try to incorporate community input and that leads to alienation and conflict inside the ecosystem.\nOnce Voltaire is in motion, the Cardano community will go from a passive watcher to an active entity when it comes to decision-making and steering of Cardano as a whole. The network will have a first-of-its-kind blockchain constitution meant to transparently and fairly rule over a decentralized network of community members.\nTo communicate directly with the community, EMURGO will be hosting an in-person Voltaire workshop in Tokyo, Japan in June 2023 along with support from IOG to discuss Cardano governance\nRead more: All you need to know about the Tokyo Voltaire workshop\nEMURGO is a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain and builds Web3 solutions on Cardano, educates aspiring Cardano developers, invests in startups building on Cardano, and informs Cardano enthusiasts on the latest developments in the Cardano ecosystem.\nWorking closely with Cardano ecosystem partners, EMURGO is committed to the development of the Cardano ecosystem for the global community.\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - October 8, 2024\nKnowledge - October 3, 2024\nKnowledge - October 1, 2024\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

    "completion": "July 17, 2023\nEMURGO\nYoroi is an open-source wallet for Cardano used to send, receive, and store ADA. As the first product developed by EMURGO, Yoroi offers speed and security in addition to a simplified user interface that doesn t compromise functionality.\nThe open-source nature of the Yoroi wallet enhances trust and provides an additional layer of security as potential vulnerabilities can be identified and addressed collaboratively by the community.\nEnsuring users have a reliable and transparent means to manage their digital assets was the primary focus during the development and design of the Yoroi wallet. Managed by EMURGO, the Yoroi wallet undergoes regular updates, audits, bug fixes, and new feature releases to ensure it remains up-to-date and responsive to user needs.\nAn open-source crypto wallet refers to a wallet whose source code is accessible to the public. Although the open-source nature doesn t ensure absolute security, it enhances credibility. Rather than relying solely on developers trustworthiness and their ability to avoid critical errors or malicious activities, individuals with the necessary skills can independently verify the code s functionalities. In contrast, a closed-source wallet requires trust in the developers, whereas an open-source crypto wallet relies on trust in the code itself.\nTransparency: Open-source crypto wallets provide transparency as their source code is publicly available allowing anyone to review, inspect, and understand the code behind the wallet. This transparency allows users to verify the security and integrity of the wallet, ensuring that there are no hidden vulnerabilities.\nEnhanced security: By allowing anyone to inspect and examine the underlying code, open-source wallets enhance security measures, making it considerably more challenging for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities.\nAuditability: With open-source code, independent entities can conduct audits to verify the security and functionality of the wallet.\nCollaborative: Join a community of developers and enthusiasts to help improve open-sourced projects like Yoroi Wallet. Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small.\nIncreased Privacy: By adopting an open-source digital wallet, users would gain greater control over their personal data or assets while ensuring their privacy. Various privacy-focused features can also be implemented with open-source wallets to ensure user confidentiality.\nRead more: Exploring the Yoroi Wallet Creative Process\nOpen-source wallets have the potential to solve the many security problems plaguing existing wallets.

    "prompt": "Protecting Your Crypto in Yoroi Popular Wallet Scams EMURGO?",
    "completion": "April 18, 2024\nEMURGO\nHistorically, the crypto market has moved in cycles and each bull swing has brought in newcomers to the space, attracted by headlines and word of mouth. This has naturally increased the prevalence of bad actors looking to take advantage of such newcomers through scams and other phishing schemes. These can result in a major loss of user funds who unknowingly take part in such schemes. Thus, at all times individual crypto users need to remain vigilant when operating in Yoroi and double-check information when conducting crypto transactions.\nPrivate keys are protected through powerful encryption on Yoroi, which prevents attackers from directly stealing crypto assets. Therefore, if a user has not disclosed their seed phrase, these scams generally require the user to inadvertently sign a fraudulent transaction. Scammers have found success using social engineering to trick users into signing harmful transactions.\nThis is why self-custodial wallets like Yoroi are the first line of defense against these scams. It s important to understand the nature of the attacks to spot them ahead of time, and never sign one of these malicious transactions.\nIn this blog, we ll go over some of the most popular types of crypto scams that result in users unintentionally approving a fraudulent transaction and how to safeguard against them.\nFor user security, Yoroi Wallet does NOT store seed phrases. Only the wallet owner has access to their seedphrase so it s important to keep this phrase in a safe place.\n1. Fake popular URLs\nThis scam is a modification of the classic phishing attack. In it, attackers create an identical-looking copy of a legitimate website and use that to lure unsuspecting victims. The fake site uses the same style, font, and branding as the original which can make it difficult to notice, even for experienced users.\nOnce a potential victim has entered the fraudulent site, a request opens in their crypto wallet and asks them to sign a transaction. This results in the user approving a transfer that drains the funds contained in his/her wallet.\n2. Fake wallet apps and extensions\nIn the digital landscape of cryptocurrency, the emergence of fake wallets represents a pressing concern, especially within trusted marketplaces like the Chrome and Android app stores. These fraudulent entities cleverly masquerade as legitimate cryptocurrency wallets, leveraging the trust and credibility established by genuine projects.\nBy adopting the guise of authenticity, fake wallets entice unsuspecting users into a trap, prompting them to input sensitive information like seed phrases or to transfer their digital assets directly into the hands of scammers. This form of deception not only capitalizes on the enthusiasm surrounding cryptocurrencies but also exploits the inherent trust users place in app stores vetting processes, underscoring a significant vulnerability in the digital asset space.\n3. Airdropped tokens or NFTs with links to fake sites\nAnother common type of crypto wallet scam or fraud consists of scammers sending new tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to targeted wallets to lure unsuspecting victims to a fake site. A user then discovers these new counterfeit assets in their wallet even though they haven t bought these assets, which have arrived unsolicited. These NFTs and/or tokens, in their metadata, prompt the user to enter a website where they are typically promised lucrative offers to claim additional rewards, which are advertised to be free as part of a special promotion.\nThe unsuspecting user enters the website, which opens their browser-based crypto wallet claiming to be a transaction to mint new rewards for free. Instead, the user again is signing off their entire wallet balance to the attackers who created the fake sites.\nRead more: What is an NFT and metadata?\n4. Fake airdrops\nAirdrop scams are another type of common attack used by hackers in the crypto industry. Airdrops are promotions whereby a digital token or a cryptocurrency is automatically delivered to certain user wallets. On the surface, it would seem to users that they would be receiving crypto for free. Airdrop scams use social engineering to exploit the willingness of crypto users to participate in incentivization programs to open their wallets and create a transaction that drains their funds.\nFor this type of crypto scam, the attackers pose as a legitimate protocol or influencer, promoting a fake airdrop portal that requests users to connect their wallets on a website. The sites are always very well constructed and seem official. Sometimes, these sites may request the seed phrase of a user s wallet. If not, they ask to sign a transaction that claims to be an airdrop when, in fact, it drains the user s crypto wallet of all its assets.\nThese types of scams are propagated on all forms of social media, email, and text messaging including YouTube.\nA website s name is often purchased on a domain name service. This means the name is reserved for the person or organization who bought that particular word or combination of words. Attackers often use very similar names but with slight variations in the actual spelling of the domain.\nAnother common tactic is to buy the same domain name but use a different extension. For example, if the domain name is under an extension .com, attackers will buy the same name but with an extension .org, .io, .site, or any other valid extension on the market.\nThe official website for Yoroi Wallet is https://yoroi-wallet.com.\nLegitimate projects and products usually always buy the security certificate for their website. When you go to a site that uses HTTPS (connection security), the website s server uses a certificate to prove the website s identity to commonly used internet browsers such as Brave, Chrome, Opera, Edge, etc.\nThis gives some added measure of security that the site is the correct one.\nYet, an SSL certificate by itself is not enough to ensure the authenticity of a site.\nIt s a good first line of defense, but other verification methods are also needed as all good scams use SSL certificates. If a website does not have an SSL certificate, that may be a cause for concern, but having an SSL certificate should not inspire confidence on its own.\nAttackers often contact crypto users on popular social media applications such as X, Reddit, Telegram, Discord, and others with promotions to airdrops, giveaways, general investment opportunities, and other too good to be true campaigns. Any unsolicited message should be viewed with caution and suspicion. Never give any personal information to people who randomly message to engage and never click on any unverified link provided in those messages.\nThe seed phrase is the master key of any crypto wallet. A dApp will never ask for the seed phrase of a wallet to work, as it only needs the user s signature on a transaction. Therefore, always leave any site asking for this information.\nThe battle against such scams necessitates a dual approach, combining user vigilance with community-driven education.\nFor users, it is imperative to download wallets exclusively from verified, official sources. This cannot be overstated, acting as the first line of defense against fraudulent schemes.\nMoreover, the open-source nature of projects like Yoroi Wallet offers an additional layer of security, allowing the community to inspect, audit, and verify the integrity of the software they re entrusting with their assets. This culture of transparency and self-custody is emblematic of the broader Cardano ecosystem s ethos, which champions decentralization and user empowerment.\nAs the crypto community continues to navigate these challenges, fostering an environment of awareness and skepticism towards unverified sources becomes crucial in safeguarding digital assets against the threat of fake wallets.\nSome tips to avoid downloading a fake wallet:\nAlso, before installing the app, review the publication on the store and ask yourself:\nAs stated before, attackers use slightly different spelling or a different extension to lure victims to a fake website. For this reason, never click on a link provided on a message, tweet, post on a message board, email, or any sort of public forum.\nIf a crypto product or dApp has caught your attention, look for URLs found through official sources. Verify the URL with the project s official channels (more than one), join the community, and read some of the messages to verify they are talking about the project as explained. There is no method to 100 proof check projects, especially if they are small or have been around for a short period.\nHere, the best advice we can provide is to have a secondary wallet, one that holds minimal funds, or better yet, no funds. That way, when a site asks to sign a suspicious transaction, no crypto assets are at risk.\nStop and carefully review any transaction before it s signed by your wallet. This is the last stop before any change is made to the balance of a crypto account so there is no need to rush. That is the main stopgap that prevents any sort of funds from being misallocated.\nSo, before signing a transaction always take your time to review the input required and the expected result. No one can move funds from a crypto wallet without the user s signing on a transaction.\nIf digital tokens or crypto magically pop up in your wallet s balance that were not purchased directly, be very cautious with them. In some cases, projects do send tokens of NFTs to users for free to create buzz for a new service or platform.\nYet, this practice has been corrupted by attackers who instead use these assets to direct users to a scam website. If a token directs you to a website, don t use the link provided. Instead, research the project, go through their socials, and see if the token is legitimate.\nNever use a link or URL provided on a public forum or a third party. Either look for the name of the service on a search engine or from an official social media post. Always check the spelling of the site and also the extension used by the project.\nAfter verifying the official site of a project, bookmark the address in a web browser. In the future, this will give direct and secure access to the same website without having to rely on links or other external references.\nMany extensions can be found on the tools that check the authenticity of a site. These can give immediate warnings if the certificate of the site does not match the name of the URL, or worse, if the site has no certificate at all.\nFinally, always double-check the conditions of a transaction before signing. When interacting with smart contracts, the wallet will provide the address of the contract. Use it to compare it with the one posted by the project or ask in their social media channels to share the official smart contract address.\nDeveloped by EMURGO Fintech, a division within EMURGO, Yoroi is an open-source crypto wallet for the Cardano ecosystem.

    "completion": "July 14, 2022\nAlbert Kim\nA crypto wallet is one of the basic pillars of any blockchain.\nIt s the gateway to that entire blockchain and the way its users can make cryptocurrency transactions.\nThus, understanding crypto wallets are crucial for users to use a blockchain effectively.\nCrypto wallets come in many types with different characteristics.\nThe method of managing a crypto wallet s private key is the best way to categorize its type.\nIn this blog, we will discuss the main crypto wallet types.\nA custodial crypto wallet is where the private key is under the control of a third party.\nThis third party shares control of the cryptocurrencies with the user of the wallet because they store the private key in their systems.\nThe result is that they can move the assets without the permission of the user, or if their system is compromised, the cryptocurrencies can be stolen.\nThe most common type of custodial wallet is a crypto exchange wallet.\nThese exchanges hold the private key of their users who created an account on their servers.\nThe user doesn t have complete control of their crypto assets, as the private key is what ultimately controls these cryptocurrencies.\nCustodial wallets make sense when interacting with centralized services.\nThey are convenient especially for beginners because they are easy to sign up for and use, especially on a crypto exchange.\nBut because of the shared nature of the private key, these are never completely secure (an exchange can be hacked) and control over the assets ultimately belong to the third-party actor.\nA hardware wallet is where the private key is managed through an external USB-like device that connects to a user s PC.\nStored offline in a location that should be known only to the user, the private key is cut off from the Internet ( cold wallet ) and considered to be in cold storage.\nHardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger are considered to be secure devices as long as crypto wallet best practices are used.\nIf a user forgets or deletes their wallet, the wallet and its private key can be recovered using the seed phrase (recovery phrase).\nA light wallet also stores its private key on the local device used upon creating the wallet, with full control residing with the user.\nIn contrast to a desktop wallet, a light wallet never downloads the entire ledger.\nThis allows for light wallets to quickly sync for transactions and connect with decentralized applications (dApps) on a particular blockchain.\nNormally, light wallets are desktop browser-based or mobile-based.\nLight wallets can also connect to the testnet version of the blockchain network. This way developers can test their dApps before deploying them to the main network.\nYoroi Wallet is an open-source Cardano light wallet and also Cardano s first light wallet with desktop and mobile versions available.\nYoroi is used to automatically connect with the Cardano NFT marketplace Fibo to purchase Cardano NFTs.\nFurthermore, light wallets like Yoroi can also connect to hardware wallets with private key control belonging to the user.\nThis way, the security of a hardware wallet is combined with the speed of a light wallet.\nA non-custodial wallet is where the private key is stored on the user s local machine upon creating the wallet.\nUsually, these are created on PCs (desktops or notebooks) and the private key is stored there.\nIn this case, the private key is not shared with anyone besides the user.\nThe desktop wallet is a program that runs on the user s PC and can connect with a given blockchain over the Internet.\nThis gives the user a higher degree of control over the cryptocurrencies stored in the crypto wallet as the user has direct control over their private key.\nThese wallets interact with a blockchain by downloading a copy of its entire ledger history.\nThe process can be slow and cumbersome, plus a considerable portion of hard disk space is required to store a local copy of the blockchain\nYoroi is an open-source Cardano community light wallet for ADA and ERG cryptocurrency users.\nYoroi allows users to easily store, send, and receive these cryptocurrencies through mobile app and desktop browser versions.\nYoroi also enables users to stake their ADA for rewards, vote for Cardano s Project Catalyst, and more including automatically connecting Cardano NFT marketplace Fibo to mint and buy NFTs.\nTo download Yoroi Wallet, please visit the official links above and go here for basic wallet guidelines on how to get started.\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO\nAbout Fibo\nKnowledge - October 8, 2024\nKnowledge - October 3, 2024\nKnowledge - October 1, 2024\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

It enables artists, creators, and businesses to tokenize assets in the form of NFTs through a simple, no-coding-required platform.\nEMURGO partnered with NMKR to raise commercial awareness and adoption of tokenization services, as it provides new ways for businesses and individuals to harness the power of blockchain technology and digitize their assets for an interested global audience. These tokenized assets can then be stored or transacted as desired using a self-custodial Cardano wallet.\nNMKR Pay is a fiat on-ramp to Cardano projects utilizing the NMKR platform for tokenization. It allows NFT creators to easily integrate a payment gateway for their tokenized asset on Cardano.\nBuyers looking to purchase these NFTs are not required to have Cardano s native cryptocurrency ADA in their crypto wallet to make the purchase.\nIn most cases, new users won t even have the cryptocurrency of a network readily available in a crypto wallet. Normally, they would need to go to a centralized exchange (CEX), log in or sign up, purchase the required cryptocurrency, send it to a wallet that uses the network, and finally make the purchase.\nRelated reading:\nThis long chain of actions poses an entry barrier and dissuades new users from joining a particular blockchain network. All these hurdles create friction points for NFT projects and blockchain-based product platforms.\nNMKR Pay aims to remove these barriers with one single tool.\nSource: NMKR.io\nIt provides an easy-to-integrate API that takes traditional payment methods such as debit and credit cards, and converts them into blockchain payments without requiring the buyer to possess or purchase ADA first.\nUsers simply have to input their card info in the tool and then NMKR Pay processes the rest. This way, new Cardano users can purchase NFTs directly on its platform without having to buy ADA from an external source.\nRecently, NMKR announced that their NMKR Pay was now available in Japanese:\nhttps://twitter.com/nmkr_io/status/1780350629153485065\nThis move creates an easier way for Japanese NFT projects to reach their audience in their native language and for buyers to purchase these digital assets using existing methods of payment, thereby reducing friction.\nBlockchain technology is global, but obstacles still exist such as multi-language support. Most blockchain products & services are still mainly provided only in English and a few major supporting languages.\nThis creates a barrier for many new potential users to adopt blockchain products & services and prevents the overall sustained growth of blockchain.\nJapan s government has also recently made strides to actively support the expansion of its domestic Web3 industry with new frameworks surrounding DAOs, investments, stablecoins, hiring, and more on the agenda.\nAre you an EMURGO and NMKR follower?\nInterested in keeping up-to-date with the latest from EMURGO s partnership with NMKR?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to receive updates about the partnership and future initiatives with NMKR to drive Cardano NFT usage for asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "How to Get Started with Intersect Cardano EMURGO?",
    "completion": "November 9, 2023\nEMURGO\nIntersect is the off-chain forum, organizer, and main hub for discussion around the distributed community governance model of the Cardano blockchain which has now transitioned to focus on distributed community governance. Its objective is to gather membership support for a sustainable, community-driven Cardano governance structure.\nAs a member-based organization (MBO), Intersect has more than 630 members and is increasing quickly. It contains various governance layers and committees to support the planning, coordination, and execution of governance matters.\nThus far, Intersect has collected the Cardano community s feedback from the CIP-1694 (the on-chain technical component of Cardano governance) workshops and is planning to create more activities to raise awareness and member participation in Cardano s off-chain governance.\nThe Intersect MBO is open to anyone in Cardano who wants to participate and help shape the future of the network.\nThe first place to retrieve official information is the Intersect website. One can find regularly updated news regarding Cardano s governance model. It s also where those looking to join Intersect can go and fill out the subscription form.\nIntersect is meant to grow a distributed and inclusive self-sustaining blockchain ecosystem by providing the accessible space necessary for structured discussion around governance for the Cardano network.\nAdditionally, Intersect will be an important institution that supports the maintenance, development, testing, fundraising, and governance infrastructure for the Cardano network.\nAll these will be accomplished via a series of working groups or committees that will meet and talk about the various needs of Cardano. The groups will be composed of members of all backgrounds from Cardano. This is why it s crucial to participate in it, as it s a great chance to contribute to the growth and future of the network directly.\nRead more: What is CIP-1694?\nIntersect runs monthly town halls where most of the latest information is presented. It s also a place where people in the community can meet and start interacting with each other. The town halls are also a place where the future of Intersect is discussed.\nAs of the writing, the working groups are still in the process of organization. The membership is not fixed and the requirements to participate in each of the groups need to be set. Also, how many working groups should initially be released is an open question.\nThis makes participating in the Town Hall even more important. Right now it s the place to enter the discussion and learn when the other functions of Intersect will come online. As Intersect is a very recent creation and it is still in the very early stages.\nTown halls are conducted remotely via Discord. The invite for the server of Intersect is sent in an email to those who join via the website. All those looking to participate must join Intersect before they get the link to enter the Discord server.\nIntersect is at its beginning stages, so it needs a lot of tools to onboard people to the community. To broaden that effort, the MBO has launched its first grants for those looking to enhance governance in the age of Voltaire for the Cardano ecosystem.\nThese grants are exclusive for those who join Intersect, but once inside, the application process is very open. The first batch of applications is already ongoing, but none of the selections have been made.\nThe classification of governance tools is divided among categories. There are currently two open applications, with two more planned in the future, these are:\nDRep Campaign Platform (currently open): In the future governance model of Cardano, ADA holders can choose delegate representatives (DReps) to cast votes on their behalf. These holders need a common space to discover and explore registered DReps. A place where a profile with the background of the person is displayed, the voting record, and other information that presents a case for that individual.\nThe current grant program is open to any tool that can create solutions at this level. It s also aiming to create a DRep campaign platform, where these people can promote themselves and make their case to the Cardano community.\nConstitutional Committee Portal (currently open): this committee is one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions under CIP-1694. The Constitutional Committee Portal will be a tool for the institution s members to share their voting records and rationale for each vote cast. It ll serve as a record for future votes and a way to track the impact of individual members.\nEducation: a future category that aims to bring tools around the education of Cardano governance. There are no more details at the moment.\nLocalization: a future category to create tools that localize the Cardano governance information. Most of it is produced in English, which excludes many members of the Cardano ecosystem, this category will aim to create tools around this issue.\nThose are the ways to start interacting with Intersect today. As the MBO grows and becomes more complex, more opportunities will open for the Cardano community. It s important to be aware and participate actively, as this is the best chance to shape the future of Cardano.\nCurious to know more about how community governance will work in Cardano?\nWant to learn more about Intersect and other Cardano community events?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X for a simple way to receive updates and helpful content to get up to speed on all things Cardano.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

Anyone can join Intersect which has more than 1,150 members.\nThis blog will further discuss the benefits of joining Intersect and its importance to Cardano s governance.\nWithin Intersect, different Special Interest and Working Groups are focused on specific objectives necessary for Cardano s future sustainability and effectiveness as a community-governed blockchain network.\nAll Groups are organized and tracked via Intersect. It is important to note that anyone who wants to join these groups must first join Intersect.\nRead more: Here are 5 ways to start participating in Intersect\nWorking Groups are Special Interest Groups activated by an Intersect committee to work on various initiatives, from technical development to policy-making, ensuring robust and inclusive decision-making and dealing with technical and non-technical issues.\nMembers can start a particular interest group and offer expertise to help shape and implement their ideas into actionable governance actions.\nThe Cardano blockchain network will have a formal constitution document that outlines the rules and procedures for community governance.\nThis document will build upon the existing interim constitution through global workshops. The Cardano community will then approve the final draft at the Constitutional Convention scheduled in Buenos Aires in December 2024.\nAs community members, everyone can contribute to shaping Cardano s foundational document.\nTo organize one of these workshops, one must register with Intersect, which will help organize, compile, and present the data from the workshops to the overall community.\nRelated reading:\nAnother benefit for Intersect members is access to special grants. This source of funding is only open to those who are an active part and contribute meaningfully to Intersect.\nThe grants can be a source of funding and resources for teams contributing to Cardano s community governance.\nSome of the funding categories that exist are:\nThe grant amounts are not pre-set and depend on the individual category.\nAs Intersect expands, more governance tools will be needed, which may also increase potential funding opportunities.\nAs mentioned, the Cardano Constitution will be a foundational document drafted by Intersect s community members.\nThe first step towards this goal will be the workshops.\nThe second step will be the Cardano Constitutional Convention, where community delegates will gather and write the first document for ratification.\nTo become a delegate, one must join Intersect. There, the different working groups will discuss the requirements and application process.\nAll those looking to be part of the drafting of the Cardano Constitution must start with Intersect.\nIntersect is driving a new push to create local governance hubs in different regions.\nThe idea is to have a place where the local Cardano community can have further in-person meetings and grow locally. Hubs exist in Japan and LATAM, with more to be added.\nMembers of Intersect can request the creation of a hub in their region. There is a process to apply, but Intersect does offer assistance to successful proposals. Only members of Intersect can use it to set up a local hub.\nThis is a great way to strengthen the local Cardano community s governance and help Intersect grow.\nWant to receive more information about Cardano governance and Intersect?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other blockchain governance-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "How Intersect Supports Cardano to be a Leader in Community Governance EMURGO?",
    "completion": "December 19, 2023\nEMURGO\nGovernance plays an important role when a group of stakeholders such as an organization, corporation, government, etc. Governance deals with the structure and process of enabling the stakeholders to cooperate and function fairly and transparently to achieve the group s mission.\nMany blockchain projects are finding out that creating a sustainable, fair, and distributed governance structure is quite complicated as their communities and developers find themselves at odds with each other as to how to best allocate resources and enable governance to be autonomously run.\nThis has genuine consequences and can be devastating for the sustainability of a blockchain network as happened with the Block Size Wars and other hard forks happening in other blockchain ecosystems. These splits are very damaging to the community and can have lasting consequences.\nSo while it s clear that governance is one of the key components for the success of a decentralized blockchain network, it s still often overlooked by most blockchain developers. It s a difficult discussion and one that can have many repercussions for community and network sustainability.\nIn this blog, we ll review some of the different Web3 or blockchain governance models and discuss how far they are along. We ll limit ourselves to models that govern an entire blockchain and not a discussion about DAOs or other mechanisms to control individual projects. In the end, we ll explain how Cardano s member-based organization Intersect and its innovative features make Cardano the leader in blockchain community governance.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, governance means the act or process of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something (such as a country or an organization) .\nIn a blockchain network, there is the added requirement that governance must also maintain decentralization or fair distribution among its community members. It must also give a voice to its community members. If these conditions are not met, then the rest of the network may fall prey to the interest of centralized actors.\nAdditionally, the core developers of a decentralized blockchain have to manage the complexity of decision-making in an international setting, as blockchains are digital domains with no physical borders. A robust governance structure will reduce uncertainty, conflicts, and costs for the stakeholders of the systems.\nStakeholders are also multi-faceted. Some users interact with the network regularly, but also the developers who created the dApps and tools for the ecosystem leveraging the network s decentralized technology. Finally, there are also infrastructure providers who maintain the network, and the nodes of the network.\nA community governance structure for a permissionless blockchain has to balance all the requirements of decentralization, its various stakeholders, and the risks of centralization. Every community member must have a way to participate in governance. In most cases, it is a monumental task that has many facets to be considered.\nThe blockchain industry has two governance models each with categories of their own. First, we have off-chain governance, and second, on-chain governance.\nOff-chain governance refers to mechanisms that are outside a blockchain. They rely on other forms of agreements that then are used to resolve disputes, assign resources, or direct development.\nSome examples are:\nMember-based organizations/consortiums: a group of voluntary organizations with ties to a blockchain ecosystem joining together to foster transparent and accountable governance through voting and regulatory measures, and other initiatives as needed\nGovernment councils: a group of people form a committee and they are the ones that direct a blockchain via votes.\nCore developers: a group of developers who work at the low levels of a blockchain network and who maintain the code repositories are the ones who choose the direction of a blockchain.\nThere are other variations, but all fall under similar designs. Several people or organizations can make changes and make decisions based on some special criteria. The results of votes and decisions sometimes can be public and other times kept hidden depending on the structure.\nOn the other hand, we have on-chain governance. This method relies on decisions made by having votes taken by stakeholders directly on top of the ledger. The path to make proposals is also open but normally it requires some sort of criteria such as being a node operator or having a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nThe main mechanism for decisions is always voting. The difference is who gets to vote and why are they given this power:\nNode operators: in most networks looking to implement on-chain voting, this is only reserved for the node operators. The logic states that since they are the ones maintaining the ledger, their input is what best aligns with the long-term success of a network.\nStakeholder direct voting: under this mechanism, all the participants in a network are given a say on the future of the blockchain. They are divided between representation sectors and voting mechanisms are developed for each one.\nDelegation: There is also an option to delegate your vote via different designated representatives.\nThe concept behind this model is that allowing a plurality of voices to decide ensures the long-term stability of a blockchain.\nIntersect is an off-chain member-based organization (MBO) supporting the on-chain governance model of Cardano. It s an open institution in which any member or organization of the Cardano community can participate. It s meant to lay the foundations of the future of the network.\nThe main way Intersect will accomplish this task is by the formation of different committees. The committees and working groups will discuss all the aspects related to governance in Cardano and support distributed community governance in tandem with the implementation of CIP-1694 features for users to easily govern Cardano. Both are essential for the success of Intersect.\nIntersect is an open hub for governance discussions. It exists as the vanguard for this topic and it ll be the backbone of the governance model of Cardano. Participation is open and there are no barriers to joining and contributing. In this way, Intersect is leading decentralized governance discussions on Cardano and across the industry.\nRead more: How to get started with Intersect\nThe committees are meant to discuss broad aspects of Cardano governance, how to support CIP-1694 (on-chain governance feature proposals for Cardano), and anything else that deals with governance.\nThey are long-term associations that will continuously improve and discuss the focus area to which they have been assigned such as the Membership Committee, the Community Committee, Open-Source community, etc.\nWith the Intersect organization helping to organize and support governance, the next piece of the puzzle is the actual and technical parts of Cardano s on-chain governance. This part deals with the registration of the SPOs, DReps, and the Constitutional Committee, and the tracking of the votes of the governance proposals. It is the portion that provides the security and audits of the feature proposals outlined and discussed within CIP-1694.\nHere Intersect is also providing tools for those looking to participate in the governance process. The main one at the moment is the SanchoNet Governance Portal. A site where community members can register as DReps, delegate their ADA, and track the votes.\nIt s all done in the SanchoNet test network, so none of the votes are binding, it s meant to be a learning playground for the future of governance. It simulates how the final platform will perform and allows the community a place to test and make changes before full release.\nRead more: What is CIP-1694?\nWant to know more about Cardano governance and Intersect?\nFollow EMURGO on X to stay up-to-date on all things related to Cardano governance including videos, blogs, and announcements.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "NMKR Launchpad Driving Growth through NFTs EMURGO?",
    "completion": "July 25, 2024\nEMURGO\nGrowth is integral to any business that provides products & services to users.\nIt also holds true for blockchain ecosystems which are experiencing a rapid uptick in dApp usage and development.\nIn the case of Cardano, its network is geared for a transition to a fully community-governed blockchain. Thus, its ecosystem needs to have internal engines of growth that can sustain and expand the number of products & services leveraging its technology.\nThis is where NMKR, an NFT and tokenization service using the Cardano blockchain, and their Launchpad service can play an important role in helping to drive ecosystem expansion.\nLet s discuss further below.\nNMKR is one of the biggest NFT creation services on Cardano. Since launching in 2021, it has allowed companies and creators to mint NFTs of desired items such as diamonds, e-books, and more. By issuing NFTs of physical and digital items, they can be freely traded on a global scale, re-sold at a later date, prove item authenticity, and provide greater item transparency to users, among other benefits.\nIts selling point lies in its ability to remove the high technical barrier to blockchain and NFTs as their core services do not require any coding. NMKR offers a complete set of technical tools including NMKR Studio that allow anyone or any business to mint NFTs, launch collections, customize token metadata, and sell NFTs with no blockchain background required.\nRelated reading:\nTo date, more than two million NFTs have been minted using the NMKR platform, and are consistently found among the top 10 most used dApps in the ecosystem.\nMoving forward, the NMKR Studio tool is continuing to evolve and will be expanded into a full launchpad.\nUser expansion is needed to sustain and grow any dApp and its blockchain ecosystem.\nOver time, a blockchain network requires more active users to collect transaction fees, increase traffic and trading volume, and more.\nIt s part of a feedback loop where bigger and better dApps drive user growth which in turn, drives blockchain network fees and usage, encouraging more developers to build on that blockchain.\nWhile most of the growth in NFTs and blockchain to a greater degree thus far, has been driven by individual users, onboarding businesses can exponentially grow an ecosystem moving forward.\nYet, businesses interested in the NFT space still need to overcome significant barriers due to the complex technical requirements and strategic nuances of launching successful NFT services.\nTo help them, NMKR is enhancing its Studio platform with a dedicated Business Onboarding Program and a robust NFT Launchpad:\nThe expanded NMKR Studio will become a one-stop shop for the entire NFT development cycle, enabling businesses to quickly ideate and launch NFT collections from a single interface without specialized knowledge.\nNMKR s Launchpad aims to become a new growth engine for Cardano by creating a usable platform that can bridge the gap between NFT technology and business needs.\nIf adopted, more NFT projects utilizing the Launchpad could bring more fees to the Cardano network and grow its treasury. Also, the increased transaction volume will expand the overall use of the network.\nOnce brands adopt and successfully launch popular NFT collections via the NMKR Launchpad, this could have a virtuous network effect and bring new users to explore the Launchpad and other related Cardano dApps such as NFT marketplaces, and lending services.\nAs a result, Cardano at the network and the dApp levels can significantly benefit from the adoption of growth engines such as NMKR s platform.\nFollow EMURGO s X and LinkedIn to receive the latest blogs and blockchain-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "Cardano NFT Case Study NMKR and Tiamonds EMURGO?",
    "completion": "February 8, 2024\nEMURGO\nWeb3 solutions providers such as NMKR are making it easy for businesses to tokenize their real-world assets using their platform and expand their business reach on a global scale. Leveraging Cardano s decentralized and research-driven blockchain technology, NMKR offers an NFT and Tokenization service that aims to bring Web3 to the masses by making it easy for anyone to mint and issue tokens of their assets. This means increased potential for revenue, brand visibility, and new customers.\nThese days, more and more types of assets are being brought into blockchain through tokenization and this expands instantaneous access to markets previously unreachable by many businesses and people.\nIn this blog, we will take a look at one of the first real business partnerships utilizing blockchain for tokenization and the unique client benefits it provides.\nDiamonds are one of the most sought-after physical items in the world, particularly for their uses in luxury jewelry. The precious gemstones are beyond the reach of many due to their pricing, and buying and investing in them can also be difficult due to administrative, handling, shipping, and safekeeping issues.\nThrough a strategic partnership with NMKR, Tiamonds provides a modern solution to these problems by using blockchain technology for the tokenization of diamonds.\nTiamonds is a platform that takes real diamonds and digitally tokenizes them as NFTs. The NFT issued by Tiamonds is a 1 to 1 representation of the ownership rights of real-world diamonds that are kept by the project. In other words, a Tiamonds NFT holder has the property rights to exchange it for a physical diamond whenever he or she wishes to do so.\nRelated reading:\nThe diamonds purchased are verified by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). Each of the diamonds is certified by one of the highest authorities on independent third-party diamond certification. The diamonds are also purchased from legitimate sources not involved in funding conflict and compliance with UN General Assembly Resolution 55/56.\nThe diamonds are held in vaults contracted by the project and insurance is purchased using the Lloyd s of London agency. As each NFT bought on the Tiamonds platform represents ownership of an individual diamond, the user can redeem his/her NFT for the physical gemstone after completing the legal requirements.\nThe platform also allows for the fast trading of tokenized diamonds. Anyone with a Tiamonds NFT can sell it over their system and receive the price for the stone, with the transaction being processed using blockchain technology. The counterparty immediately receives ownership of the diamond once the transaction is complete.\nA Web3 service such as Tiamonds enhances the liquidity of diamonds and provides an interesting use case for tokenization, as people don t have to physically move the stones from one location to another. Transactions and settlements are nearly instantaneous, completed with transparency (transaction information can be viewed in real-time online), and enhanced security. Every diamond has the GIA certification, so there is no risk of counterfeits inside the Tiamonds platform.\nAccording to Tiamonds, it believes that asset tokenization will grow to become a market worth at least USD 10 trillion by 2030, representing a 40-fold increase in the value of tokenized assets from 2022 to 2030. This would mark a significant rise from the current value of around USD 300 billion.\nTiamonds partnered with NMKR to sell 34 of its NFT diamonds on the Cardano blockchain by leveraging NMKR s tokenization platform. They identified Cardano as the next network to expand their tokenized diamonds due to its research-driven and provably secure technology and selected NMKR to prepare the NFTs.\nThe teams used the NMKR Studio tool to set up a store for the 34 Tiamond NFTs, as seen in this link. Within 48 hours, the entire collection of 34 NFTs sold out, marking a major success for the project and its first venture in the Cardano network.\nRead more: What is NMKR Studio?\nThe teams also prepared a giveaway to celebrate Cardano Summit 2023, the annual flagship event for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Tiamonds prepared 10 of its unique NFTs for a giveaway at the Summit. The project distributed 1000 QR codes, and 10 lucky winners received the tokenized diamonds as NFTs.\nThe partnership showcases the versatility and power of NMKR Studio. Tiamonds was able to quickly set up its tokenized diamonds using Cardano NFTs which sold out almost immediately. Second, the team launched a giveaway during the most important Cardano event of 2023 to increase awareness and visibility.\nNMKR and Tiamonds have shown the power of tokenization of assets using blockchain technology. It immediately opens up market access, reduces transactional friction, and speeds up settlement, all with increased security and transparency.\nAre you interested in asset tokenization on Cardano using NMKR?\nWant to keep up-to-date with the latest from EMURGO s partnership with NMKR?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to receive updates about the partnership and future initiatives with NMKR to drive Cardano NFT usage for asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

It is one of the biggest potential use cases for blockchain technology and could spur the next significant digital transformation of traditional industries.\nThis new narrative is also directing large investments into the real-world asset tokenization market, especially into products & services that are in development. The goal is to grab a big share of this potentially lucrative market and bring tokenized assets into a particular blockchain ecosystem.\nIn this blog, let s discuss how much the real-world asset tokenization market can grow and why blockchain developers are focusing their efforts on it.\nAs mentioned in a previous blog explaining the two main types of asset classes, real-world assets are tangible in that they have some sort of physical component to make them real in the sense of being concrete or having material properties.\nThese can be currencies, collectibles, real estate, fine art, commodities such as precious metals, diamonds, raw materials, and more.\nTraditional digital assets are intangible such as stocks, bonds, intellectual property, financial derivatives, etc.\nBoth types of assets can be digitally represented and transacted as a token issued on a blockchain.\nRelated reading:\nIn some cases, this can be done quickly using smart contracts and tokens.\nIn other cases, this can be more complicated as some of these assets are subject to stricter regulations and compliance measures. ]\nYet, the technology and potential exist for real-world and traditional digital assets to be brought into a blockchain network through tokenization, and then for the token to be transacted and recorded on that network.\nThe unique benefits of asset tokenization include:\nIt is a little tricky to estimate the actual valuation of the current asset tokenization market due to different methods of estimation.\nHowever, one of the most useful examples is looking at stablecoins which are one of the earliest forms of asset tokenization.\nA stablecoin is a digital blockchain-based token that is backed by deposits of fiat currencies and other financial instruments, in essence, tokenization of currencies. Some of the most common ones in circulation are Tether USDT and Circle USDC which are based on the US dollar.\nOn the other hand, stablecoins that use cryptocurrencies as a reserve and algorithms to create a peg with the U.S. dollar or other fiat currency are not considered real-world assets. These types of assets are called synthetic assets as they mirror the properties of a real-world asset, but do not rely on the ownership of the original instrument. In most cases, these types of tokens are excluded from the total market calculation.\nAnalytics firms such as 21.co value the current asset tokenization market (as of writing) at around $87 billion with stablecoins accounting for 97 of that total value.\nThis means that other use cases for asset tokenization such as commodities, real estate, collectibles, stocks, bonds, etc. have yet to take off and can significantly expand in the years to come.\nNow that we have an understanding of the current size of the asset tokenization market and its reliance on stablecoins, we can discuss some basic projections.\nThe list of real-world and traditional digital assets that can be tokenized is almost endless, so there are a lot of possibilities.\nThe same report by 21.co has three forecasts:\nThe chart divides real-world assets into six categories and then uses them to give projections of where things can be by the end of 2030.\nIn another forecast, Boston Consulting Group projects tokenized financial assets to be valued at $11 trillion by 2030.\nMost of the growth is projected to come from other assets that are not fiat currencies as can be expected. The current RWA market is dominated by the tokenization of fiat in the form of stablecoins. As this sector is almost saturated, future growth will come from other real-world assets being tokenized.\nAn example of this trend is US government bonds. In 2023, the tokenization of these assets grew 450 , making it the largest asset class to be tokenized over the past year. This is just one example of where the market is already moving. Singapore s central bank has started testing tokenization with established financial institutions and working on a tokenized government bond fund. Asian countries such as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, and European countries such as Germany, Luxembourg, France, and Switzerland have tested issuing digital bonds as well. To date, only about $4 billion of tokenized bonds have been issued with the traditional global bond market valued at $130 trillion.\nThese facts give a glimpse into what the future holds for asset tokenization as governments and financial institutions are testing the tokenization of traditional digital assets such as bonds. Once more regulatory clarity is given and more products and services come into the market, asset tokenization can take its next leap forward.\nLooking for more content on real-world asset tokenization using blockchain technology?\nEMURGO has partnered with NFT and Tokenization platform NMKR to drive the adoption of asset tokenization leveraging the Cardano blockchain via NMKR.\nFollow EMURGO on X to receive more updates on tokenization and future in-person events with NMKR.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "What to Know About the Chang Hard Fork Cardano EMURGO?",
    "completion": "July 17, 2024\nEMURGO\nUpdate:\nAs part of the first upgrade of the Chang Hard Fork, the Cardano genesis keys have been burned. The process was triggered on September 1st and kickstarted the Conway Era in epoch 507. Hard forks will now be able to be triggered by a governance action proposed by the community. Governance bodies such as SPOs and DReps will vote on the proposed changes and the Constitutional Committee shall decide whether to use or not its veto power. These functions will be introduced through the second upgrade of the Chang Hard Fork.\nA blockchain hard fork is essentially an upgrade in the software run by the distributed nodes (servers) that validate and secure the network. As decentralized blockchains are governed by a set of rules (protocol) followed by each participant in the network, each node will have to implement the upgrade to continue playing its role.\nA hard fork can deliver new functions and features to the network and improve security, among other benefits.\nIn Cardano, a hark fork is delivered via a hard fork combinator (HFC), ensuring a smooth transition during the upgrade to a new protocol. In other blockchains, a hard fork can potentially result in network downtime and other inconveniences. For the Chang Hard Fork, at least 70 of stake pool operators (SPOs) will need to upgrade to the new node version and 80 of exchange liquidity will need to be ready.\nThis will mark the first step towards a minimum-viable community-run governance structure outlined in CIP-1694, meaning that the Cardano community will be responsible for maintaining and shaping the blockchain network. It will be instituted with the consent of the community, including network SPOs.\nThe Chang Hard Fork is a technical component of the Voltaire era of the Cardano roadmap, which focuses on implementing a sustainable and distributed governance framework. With the first part set to be initiated in July 2024, the next part of the Hard Fork upgrade is set to happen by Q4 of this year.\nPart one of the hard fork aids the transition to a fully community-governed blockchain network and the entrance into a technical bootstrapping phase. Due to its complexity and the involvement of many community stakeholders, Cardano s distributed governance will take time to implement completely. While the network is in this process of transformation, temporary governance institutions will support the transition.\nFirst, the Interim Cardano Constitution is released by Cardano s off-chain governance organization Intersect. It s a guiding document that will give guardrails during the transition period. It is meant to be a bridge to the actual Constitution, which is set to be drafted and ratified by the community at the Cardano Constitutional Convention later in the year.\nRead more: What does Intersect do for Cardano governance?\nDuring this first upgrade of the Chang Hard Fork, the hash of this interim constitution will be included as part of the new node version (Cardano Node 9.0.0), which supports entering the bootstrapping phase of CIP-1694 and is to be implemented by all network participants. This will ensure the text s integrity and serve as a trial for when the full Constitution is ratified.\nSecond, Intersect has opened the Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC). This temporary governance body will uphold the principles of the interim Constitution and vote on the first on-chain governance actions. The committee will have seven members during its existence, including three elected by the community.\nThis interim body will have a veto power that will be enacted via on-chain voting and introduced as part of the Chang Hard Fork.\nThe second part will introduce several of the final upgrades needed for full community-run governance. It s a more complex piece than Part One and is expected to happen in Q4 of 2024. It ll mark the start of full-force decentralized governance and the exit from a technical bootstrapping phase.\nPart Two will introduce the Delegate Representatives (DReps) as a governance body. The DReps can register and generate a certificate, request ADA delegations, and vote on governance proposals. All these functions will be part of the Cardano network.\nRead more: Explaining the governance bodies in Cardano\nSecond, SPOs voting on governance actions will be possible. They will have the chance to use their delegated ADA as voting power. This will give them the chance to approve or reject governance actions.\nThird, the Constitutional Committee will be online. This body will be able to grow its membership past the seven of the interim committee. It ll also have full veto power on all governance actions the group finds contradict the constitution.\nFinally, the community will then be in charge of treasury withdrawals. Cardano users will be able to propose treasury debits via governance actions. The three bodies (Constitutional Committee, DReps, and SPOs) will vote on them, and if approved, ADA will be moved out of the treasury.\nFrom that point forward, the future of the Cardano blockchain will be in the hands of its community, along with its power to draft and ratify the Cardano Constitution. This will mark a monumental step not only for the network but also for the blockchain industry as a whole, as Cardano will be the first truly distributed and community-run blockchain network.\nWant to receive more essential information about Cardano updates, courses, and related events?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to stay up-to-date.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

The community will draft and ratify this document at the first Cardano Constitutional Convention, which will be held later this year.\nOther critical components of Cardano s distributed governance are, but not limited to:\nAll these parts and more will play an essential role in the stewardship of Cardano s distributed governance.\nThis blog will discuss further the details of the Cardano Constitutional Convention and its implications.\nThe event will gather prominent community members, thought leaders, and other visionaries in the Cardano ecosystem. The convention will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2024.\nMany planned discussions, presentations, networking, and other usual activities will occur. The most important portion will be the workshops focused on drafting the Cardano Constitution.\nRelated reading:\nIn these workshops, Cardano delegates worldwide will assemble, divide into working groups, and start drafting portions of the Constitution based on community feedback. As the document will be used to guide rules and procedures related to governance, there will be careful debates around the constitution s wording, the document s technical aspects, and the governance actions needed to be added to the text.\nAfterward, the complete first draft of the Cardano Constitution will be presented.\nThis will signal the end of the Constitutional Convention, after which the community will review the draft provided and decide on ratification.\nThe Constitutional Convention will be a significant event for Cardano and the blockchain industry. Once ratified, Cardano will be the first truly decentralized and distributed blockchain network governed by its community, including its treasury.\nIntersect is organizing and supporting a series of workshops around the Cardano Constitution worldwide. Intersect members are encouraged to join and host a workshop.\nThe workshops aim to generate community feedback on the Constitution and serve as the first stage of the Convention. In each workshop, the participants plan to elect a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. This person will represent the participants and help draft the Constitution.\nThe number of delegates is planned to equal the number of workshops conducted in different countries. These individuals will travel to the Constitutional Convention and participate in further workshops and debates to finally write a first draft of the Cardano Constitution.\nFind a local workshop near you.\nOnce the draft of the Constitution has been completed, everyone in the community will have a period to read the final draft.\nAfter this, a date will be set for a network-wide vote to ratify the Cardano Constitution.

    "completion": "August 20, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe road to the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is starting to reach its destination.\nPlanned for the end of the year, the gathering will mark a milestone for the Cardano blockchain as a community-drafted version of the Cardano Constitution will be presented and voted upon for ratification to officially implement a distributed governance framework.\nThe wheels to community-run governance have already been in motion for the Cardano network, starting with CIP-1694, which outlines proposals for Cardano s on-chain governance functions and features. Intersect, a member-based organization open to all, has also been launched and is working to support governance by organizing community workshops, forming various groups and committees, and assigning important governance-related tasks to interested parties.\nDuring this transitional period leading up to the Constitutional Convention, the Cardano network requires temporary governance functions and features to bridge the gap between the present and the official ratification of the Constitution. An interim Constitutional Committee and a provisional interim Cardano Constitution have been formed to address this need.\nThis blog will cover more about Cardano s interim Constitutional Committee and Constitution.\nRead more: View the interim Constitution.\nThe formation of a temporary or interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) has been approved to bootstrap Cardano s governance era. This body will have all of the duties of the full Constitutional Committee after the second upgrade of the Cardano blockchain s Chang Hard Fork. The ICC has been elected for a minimum of 73 epochs in the Cardano network.\nOriginally, the Cardano blockchain had managed its technical updates via a group of genesis keys. A majority of the keys were needed to push a new hard fork to the network and begin the process of adoption by the stake pools.\nHowever, after the Chang Hard Fork, there will be seven votes belonging to the members of the ICC, including those from the community, Intersect, EMURGO, IO (Input Output), and Cardano Foundation.\nThe members of this temporary body won t receive any remuneration for being part of the ICC, but they will assist in guiding the Cardano network towards ratification of the Constitution, among other things.\nRecently, a few members of the ICC took part as individual participants in the first Cardano Constitutional Workshop held in Berlin, Germany on July 28, 2024, to explore community input about selected key topics related to the drafting of the Constitution.\nRelated reading:\nOf course, if there isn t a Constitution, there would be nothing for a Constitutional Committee to uphold. As with the ICC, there is also an interim Cardano Constitution to bridge the gap until its official ratification.\nThe text of this document has been drafted by the Civics Committee of Intersect.\nThe interim Constitution will also be added on-chain during the first upgrade of the Chang Hard Fork. The entire text will be hashed and added to every updated node in the Cardano network to ensure the integrity of the interim Constitution.\nOnce the official Constitution is drafted and ratified, it ll also be hashed and added on-chain to the Cardano network. The text of the interim Constitution can be found here.\nDuring the first Constitutional workshop held last month, the community discussed specific topics related to the drafting of the document including financial sustainability, voting rights, principles and tenets, and budget allocations.\nMore workshops are scheduled globally throughout August and September in the lead-up to the Cardano Constitutional Convention.

    "prompt": "Cardano NFTs 10 Most Frequently Asked Questions FAQs EMURGO?",
    "completion": "September 6, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) made inroads into mainstream pop culture in 2021 and 2022. They attracted the attention of big companies, media personalities, influencers, and brands, and became a trendy buzzword.\nDespite their popularity, many misconceptions remain regarding the nature and value of NFTs. This has led to misunderstandings about its use cases and the underlying blockchain technology, with some being quick to write them off as a fad focused on the trading of digital images.\nThis blog aims to give clear answers to commonly asked questions about NFTs, in particular those issued on the Cardano blockchain, and give users a better understanding.\nAn NFT is a type of digital asset issued on a blockchain network that has a unique ID to distinguish it from others. The identifier is used to single out a particular digital token from other token types and also within a particular NFT collection. Thus, it is non-fungible.\nThis property means that developers and businesses can mint and use NFTs to represent a wide range of unique properties or assets, not just pictures and images.\nThis ability opens up a whole host of use cases that NFTs can be adapted for or created on their own, such as the tokenization of a variety of assets.\nRelated reading:\nIn the Cardano blockchain network, NFTs follow what is called the native token model.\nAssets are independent entities on the blockchain ledger and do not require a smart contract to be created or to exist. This model provides more power and flexibility to blockchain developers and businesses looking to create NFTs leveraging the Cardano blockchain.\nA Cardano NFT is identified by a Policy ID. This is a unique identifier that is generated by a mining script used to create a token. It sets apart an NFT from other assets recorded on the Cardano blockchain.\nMetadata is data, or information, about the token. It s a field that can be used to express many details about a particular asset.\nIn an NFT collection, metadata is where the creator creates the naming convention of each NFT.\nOther uses of metadata and NFTs are relevant and necessary information related to the NFT such as details of a contract between parties, transaction history, source of origin, etc.\nFor example, if an NFT is created to digitally represent a physical diamond, the metadata can have information such as when and where the diamond was mined, authentication certifications, etc.\nIn Cardano, the capacity of token metadata is bigger than compared to other traditional blockchains. Hence, NFTs on Cardano can contain more data.\nRead more: NFTs and token metadata 101\nMost times, NFTs are paired with some sort of media file that interests a user or prospective buyer. These can be images on an NFT collection, short animations, sounds, music, etc. However, these files are usually too large to be recorded on a blockchain economically.\nFor this reason, a supplemental technology has emerged that provides decentralized storage for these files. Networks like AIOZ Network are used to upload the media of the NFT and the hash of it is recorded on the metadata of the asset.\nRead more: What is decentralized storage?\nIn principle no.\nAn NFT is a digital asset that does not have decimals like regular tokens do. A user cannot sell or transfer half of an NFT to another person. On a distributed blockchain ledger such as Cardano, they are digitally recorded as single units that cannot be broken down.\nIn some cases, an NFT can become so valuable that a single individual may not have enough resources to buy it single-handedly. This is where NFT fractionalization comes into the picture.\nWhile the original NFT is locked in a smart contract, the code of the contract creates fractions that represent partial ownership of an NFT. These fractions can then be freely traded by those who buy them through marketplaces or peer-to-peer.\nFor example, if an NFT were to represent a specific type of real estate, fractionalization could potentially enable multiple buyers to purchase, own, and trade portions of that particular property.\nThere are two main ways to purchase an NFT.\nFirst, is from the primary source, or the developer(s) that creates an NFT collection which is a series of NFTs that have a unique theme. They can release an NFT sale via a platform they create or via a third party that provides NFT minting and selling such as NMKR an NFT and tokenization service using the Cardano blockchain.\nSecond, is on the secondary market. Initial buyers resell their NFTs on specialized marketplaces that can sell the asset for a fixed price or as an auction. In either case, the buyer is purchasing the NFT from a previous owner and not the original creators.\nRead more: How NMKR tokenized physical diamonds\nOn Cardano, an NFT or an NFT collection is searched using the Policy ID. This identifier can be used to retrieve all the assets minted using it, such as within an NFT collection, or single tokens that have said ID.\nHowever, searching for new NFTs that are about to be launched is different. The best way would be to follow NFT platforms such as NMKR, which provide information on new and upcoming NFT collections minted on their platform.\nAnother way to find NFTs is through Discord NFT communities where creators start promoting their upcoming drops. NFT collectors can then be ahead of the general public when looking for new NFTs that have the potential to become popular.\nOn Cardano, an NFT is created using a minting script. The script generates the Policy ID of the NFT, the size of the collection, the information on the metadata, and other details. A script can be generated using the Cardano-cli or with a smart contract.\nAnother simpler way is by using an NFT minting platform. This could be a dApp (decentralized application) that provides a service for minting NFTs using no-code solutions such as graphical interfaces or APIs.\nNMKR is an established NFT platform service that allows anyone to easily create and sell NFTs without having to be a smart contract developer. Removing this technical barrier opens up access to NFTs for businesses and individuals looking to integrate Web3 technologies.\nThis is a misconception that comes from two sources. First, the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm used by Bitcoin can be very energy-intensive. Second, as NFTs first appeared on Ethereum, many were concerned about their environmental impact when it was a PoW network before it transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS).\nCardano was designed from its inception to be an environmentally friendly proof-of-stake network by employing an energy-efficient protocol. Statistics show Cardano to be significantly greener and compliant with the EU s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) sustainability indicators.\nOn Cardano, the native asset model allows for the ownership of an asset to be fully transferred to a buyer. On other networks, NFTs are created using smart contracts. If the code in the contract is compromised, the NFT can be deleted from the blockchain ledger including the one bought by users.\nCardano has created a different model where assets are entities on the blockchain ledger. Once an NFT is minted and a user buys it, the asset becomes the whole property of the buyer. Even if the original creators stop promoting the NFT or maintaining the website, the NFT itself will always be part of the ledger and property of the owner.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily create NFTs by providing tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established platform, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets.\nInterested in learning more about NFT use cases and NMKR s tokenization service?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for regular updates and content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "What to Know About Dynamic NFTs EMURGO?",
    "completion": "June 20, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) are regaining interest as new use cases such as asset tokenization have garnered focus from different industries looking into blockchain technology.\nThese digital assets took off in 2020 and 2021, becoming associated with ownership of creative content such as artwork and videos.\nHowever, NFTs have also broadened their potential beyond their initial use cases. Through token metadata and other technologies, innovation is emerging within the NFT sector.\nThis blog discusses Dynamic NFTs as one of these innovations and how they could potentially be used by businesses, organizations, and individuals moving forward.\nToken metadata is a key element separating NFTs from traditional fungible tokens.\nAlthough a transfer of a fungible token can have metadata, it usually refers to information about the transaction and not the actual asset itself.\nHowever, metadata in an NFT refers to information about the asset or project itself, or attributes of a certain collection.\nIn other words, NFT metadata records and displays information about the tokenized asset rather than the transaction of a token.\nMetadata, for this reason, is very important for an NFT.\nBut there are also several limitations associated with it.\nRelated reading: EMURGO Academy explains token metadata and NFTs\nFor example, while on-chain storage or storing the NFT metadata on a blockchain is considered to be more secure, it also tends to be expensive, especially as the accumulated information grows.\nOff-chain storage, or storing the NFT metadata somewhere else, can sometimes be cheaper but it is riskier and does not guarantee long-term availability as it also might depend on the service provider helping to store the NFT metadata.\nIf the server storing the metadata goes offline or is hacked, the information can be lost. This can be permanent if safe practices for creating and storing data backups for the data are also not in use.\nFor this reason, the Cardano blockchain network offers space in the network to store increased metadata. This information is saved by the nodes and does not need to rely on an external party to store the metadata.\nThis saves NFT developers from having to complicate their token s design by using third-party storage providers. The metadata recorded on Cardano also remains safe long term, as it s backed by the nodes themselves.\nThis simplification reduces the work of NFT developers and projects and also those looking to buy the assets as they don t have to verify the storage of the metadata to ensure it is safe to buy the token.\nAt the moment, most NFTs issued on the Cardano blockchain work using the standards set out by Cardano Improvement Proposal 25 or CIP-25. lt outlines the metadata format needed to enable Cardano wallets to read NFTs.\nIt has created a uniform way to mint NFTs on Cardano, but it also has some limitations.\nNotably, CIP-25 metadata is fixed.\nThis means once metadata has been created, it cannot be updated later nor can more information be added once the asset has been minted as an NFT.\nFor fixed NFT collections of artwork or other creations, this has worked wonderfully, as the immutability of metadata increases the security of the asset. But for other use cases, this is not the case.\nThis is where the concept of mutable metadata or Dynamic NFTs becomes useful.\nThis is a format that allows the modification or update of the information contained in the metadata after the NFT or token is minted. This greatly expands the utility of NFTs to new potential use cases.\nThese NFTs with mutable metadata are known as Dynamic NFTs because the information can be changed later by following certain rules that allow them to be more versatile.\nDynamic NFTs have use cases where certain initial conditions are prone to later change, such as:\nCardano as an open-source blockchain network has incorporated all the necessary tools of Dynamic NFTs via the adoption of CIP-68.\nThis community proposal, titled Datum Metadata Standard, ensures rules to update and modify NFT metadata.\nThis has also been adopted by all digital asset wallets in the Cardano ecosystem such as Yoroi, making it a ready-to-use feature by NFT developers to enable their tokens to be integrated with Cardano wallets.\nNMKR, an NFT and tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain, has also added CIP-68 to its NMKR Studio tool library.\nThus, businesses and creators can release NFTs and tokenized assets via NMKR Studio using these added tools and give more utility to their NFT collections with the ability to update and modify metadata as needed.\nLooking to stay updated on Cardano NFTs and asset tokenization?

    "completion": "August 15, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe music industry is filled with a vast number of stakeholders including record labels, publishing companies, musicians, fans, artist agencies, and other affiliated companies, all over the world.\nOver the past several decades, it has seen a technological progression in recorded music formats from vinyl to cassette tapes to CDs to MP3s, and now streaming. Along with this evolution, control has also gradually shifted from large record companies and music publishing companies to the musicians themselves.\nWhile large music companies continue to still have a significant presence in the industry by having many resources at their disposal, the emergence of blockchain technology has now presented viable alternative solutions for independent music artists to give them more control over their music and careers.\nHere are 5 examples of how blockchain-based NFTs (non-fungible tokens) can be a much-needed solution for these musicians today.\nMusic royalties have commonly been and still are a contentious subject in many cases, especially between artists and record labels. Many lawsuits have been filed between labels, distributors, agents, and musicians around the distribution of royalties, with musicians typically claiming to have been compensated unfairly. In most cases, these royalty rights are unclear or convoluted, leading to protracted court battles.\nNowadays, by using decentralized blockchain technology, NFTs are not only a type of digital token that can represent a specific asset, but they can also represent a set of clearly established rules for an asset.\nThis can enhance transparency and clarity for the musician, record label, and other stakeholders. Artists who wish to stay independent can also receive more benefits by going directly to consumers.\nFor example, there can be an NFT issued by a musician that represents a particular song. This NFT is minted on a blockchain network and the data is stored there. This blockchain network is maintained and kept secure by other participants who are incentivized to do so. Within the NFT s metadata, the distribution of royalties and proceeds from the song can be encoded in a way that is clear for all parties and also made immutable. From that point forward, every transaction involving the NFT must always follow the same rules.\nAny stakeholder is also able to review these sets of conditions at any point and ensure that the distribution is fair for all parties.\nRelated reading:\nCopyright-related issues are another major problem in the music industry. Today, the internet is a huge global sea of information and many content creators use pieces of copyrighted music they find in their social media videos. While some platforms are quick to remove such pieces of content, many still are unable to do so effectively.\nThus, in these cases, proper attribution and compensation to the copyright holder is not given.\nCommonly, this comes down to the complexity of buying song rights and finding where to get them.\nHowever, songs represented as NFTs can represent an established, open market for these pieces of music. Through a consolidated marketplace that lists NFTs of songs and recorded music, they can be used properly by content creators and media companies while also compensating the original copyright holder.\nIf a segment of a song is only used, NFTs can also be priced fractionally, enabling buyers to pay partially.\nBy having stronger copyright enforcement, copyright holders can grab more profits from the purchase of their music NFTs. Artists who own these copyrights can then benefit.\nAnother advantage of NFTs is that they are easier to share and distribute due to their digital nature.\nWhile music can be purchased online these days, this is still mostly done through a centralized platform that takes commissions and stores user data. Settlement for artists and companies can also take several days up to weeks.\nHowever, when music is represented as NFTs, it can be distributed and settled instantly on a blockchain ledger. This enables the transfer of music and payments to be bundled in a single transaction. A consumer or fan would just need a digital wallet that can store, send, and receive NFTs, and be able to pay using cryptocurrencies.\nPayment settlements and music purchases would be instantaneous.\nIf going direct to consumers, independent musicians could have a global reach with their audience while receiving payments immediately.\nPayments on a global scale are a difficult problem. Music platforms usually have to deal with several intermediaries which take commissions from sales and settlements typically take time. Musicians also need to wait for enough money to accumulate before they can withdraw anything from their earnings.\nHowever, NFTs are part of a particular blockchain, where payments are conducted using a token or cryptocurrency issued on that network. Any amount is instantly transferred to the wallet selling an NFT, plus the wallet that collects royalties. This all happens under a single technological system. There is no need to have a separate payment layer.\nThis can mean a potential reduction of the entire burden of fees and the complexity of international payments. The result could support artists to collect more money from their sales and also have direct payments from their followers.\nArtist promotion and connecting with consumers is as much a part of their overall success as the music itself.\nNFTs have the potential to deliver unique value in these areas as well.\nTheir technological properties allow for free NFT drops, meaning musicians can distribute samples of their music for free to hundreds of people directly to their digital wallets. They can also allow for certain types of exclusive fan rewards distributed to every wallet that holds an NFT from a singer or band, instantly creating a community.\nThese NFTs can then be collected and resold, kept as a commemorative item, or even redeemed for other items or benefits from the musician or company issuing them.\nAs the most passionate music fans tend to be of a younger demographic, they are also more technically inclined and more likely to embrace new emerging technologies such as NFTs.\nThis bodes well for musicians who are willing to experiment and integrate the usage of such technologies to attract new fans, increase fan engagement, and enhance control over their careers.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily mint NFTs without having to code by providing simple-to-use tools.\nHaving already partnered with Tiamonds to issue and sell NFTs of physical diamonds and Book.io to tokenize e-books, NMKR has demonstrated successful use cases for NFTs using its platform.\nMusicians can also utilize the platform to mint NFTs to receive some of the benefits listed above.\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to receive weekly updates and blog content on blockchain use cases, NFT insights, Cardano ecosystem news, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "How NFTs Add Value to Businesses EMURGO?",
    "completion": "July 18, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) have been increasingly linked with traditional, big businesses with interest rising in blockchain and the Web3 space.\nTheir business value lies in the unique power to digitally represent brand assets as a token which opens up the potential for increased consumer engagement, new revenue streams, enhanced intellectual property management, community building, and more.\nYet, there are still some obstacles to mainstream NFT adoption.\nThis blog discusses these further and how solving them can add value for companies.\nThe first obstacle is overcoming the technical barrier of coding and programming blockchain smart contracts. For many businesses today, blockchain technology is still an abstract concept that many are unfamiliar with and unaware of its game-changing potential benefits.\nThus, these businesses lack the technical developers to start developing and implementing Web3 technologies such as NFTs and the business development personnel to leverage them for revenue generation.\nThen, there are other businesses that might be aware of the potential of NFTs and blockchain but are hesitant due to the high costs of hiring smart contract developers. They are not only expensive but vetting their technical skills is complicated especially for HR departments unfamiliar with the blockchain space.\nRelated reading:\nOften these challenges are enough to prevent brands from considering the development and implementation of blockchain and related Web3 products & services. Even among many major current brands, few have dedicated tech departments focused on blockchain-related projects.\nAnother obstacle is maintaining brand integrity. For instance, particular brand guidelines that dictate the usage and styling of a business logo, the name of a product or brand, color palettes, and other intricate details make it more difficult to migrate a particular brand into issuing NFTs that represent their products.\nThe problem is even more complicated if a business needs to develop an in-house NFT platform from scratch. Hiring is one obstacle, and then close coordination between the technical team and business development teams is another challenge in and of itself.\nAll these complications also discourage brands from adopting NFTs as they don t want to compromise their brand identity.\nThe general narratives surrounding blockchain are usually centered around crypto which tends to focus more on high-profile failures and scams.\nCombined with also a lack of awareness, this has dissuaded some brands from making sizeable investments of time and money into NFTs and blockchain technology. Many are also unable to identify and partner with reputable companies in the space for technological support.\nHowever, there is a significant and growing community of worldwide users passionate about and interested in using blockchain-based products and services, in addition to cryptocurrencies.\nThis has led to companies and brands thinking about how to connect with these young consumers and leverage blockchain for new products and services.\nFor each of the challenges mentioned above, NMKR s NFT platform provides a solution.\nFor instance, NMKR Studio is a no-code solution that allows any business the ability to deploy its product on Cardano without dedicated smart contract developers. It enables brands to instantly get into the NFT space without having to hire a huge technical team or invest heavily into building their own platform.\nRead more: How NMKR maximizes brand impact\nCompanies can start to dabble in Web3 by tokenizing their assets via NMKR and start to market-test different ideas.\nNMKR is also able to create NFT platforms customized to the look and identity of a specific brand, thereby maintaining brand integrity.\nFinally, NMKR delivers scalability and sustainability via its usage of the Cardano blockchain for NFTs. Brands can be assured that the underlying technology of their NFTs is held to the highest technical standard due to Cardano s provably secure and green technology.\nHere are some potential business benefits of NFTs.\nThese days, brands are facing an oversaturated landscape where traditional advertising is becoming less effective at reaching younger consumers who are more inclined towards embracing trendy, digital-native concepts. Companies that make the jump towards Web3 have shown success in attracting new customers and also creating media stories about their efforts.\nFor example, Nike-RTFKT NFTs have generated $1.4 billion in trading volume equaling around $170 million in earnings by targeting the sneakerhead and crypto-focused audience.\nAnother recent example is the McLaren F1 team, which launched an NFT collection for the 2024 season. The NFTs have been trading in the secondary market and every single one is minted until the supply is exhausted during each race. The NFTs have allowed F1 and McLaren fans to get closer to their favorite sport. Additionally, those collecting the NFTs have the chance to attend one of the races in person. By doing this, McLaren has grown its brand awareness and created a path for fans to be closer to their team.\nIn an increasingly digital landscape with a young consumer demographic, NFTs can create unique experiences and rewards for customers such as exclusive access to events or special edition digital goods. These consumers are willing to be early adopters of new technological trends and can create network effects for digital products such as NFTs. Over the long run, this could strengthen consumer loyalty and engagement with a certain brand if they can utilize NFTs to promote their brand and products in a savvy way.\nNFTs allow businesses to uniquely and digitally represent their products to sell them to consumers on a global scale.\nAt a few clicks of a button, businesses can tokenize their assets using a platform such as NMKR, and issue NFTs.\nAnyone in the world interested in these products could theoretically be able to purchase them outright or even fractionalized portions.\nThis enables brands to more quickly reach an increased number of potential customers and it also allows customers to transact these NFTs with others on secondary marketplaces.\nNFTs can hold programmable metadata within the token itself. This means that unique characteristics defining an asset that has been tokenized and other important details can be incorporated into the NFT by a business. This can verify the authenticity of a product, display transaction history, source of origin, and other information.\nIt would become more difficult to counterfeit brand products and this holds immense appeal for businesses dealing with unique collectibles or luxury items that are commonly counterfeited.\nOnce tokenized as NFTs, business products or assets can be sold to others via the Internet instantly. By leveraging blockchain technology, NFTs can be transacted on a global scale and increase the potential liquidity of a product.\nNFT holders can also re-sell their NFTs to others on marketplaces if they choose to do so. For some assets that can be fractionalized, it also enables multiple buyers to buy a piece of a product that would otherwise be too expensive for them to buy outright themselves.\nInterested in gaining more insights on the use cases of and other related information about NFTs?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "DAOs Decentralized Autonomous Organization in 2024 EMURGO?",
    "completion": "February 13, 2024\nEMURGO\nDAOs or decentralized autonomous organizations are one of the unique entities that were able to be created thanks to decentralized blockchain technology. DAOs are virtual organizations that make decisions, manage resources, start products, and launch projects without a central authority. Essentially, they are an organization or company that runs itself with its own set of rules via its members.\nThe DAO model has been used many times to great success across many different blockchain ecosystems and types of organizations. The result is a new ecosystem of organizations that are global and accept members from virtually anywhere in the world.\nNow, DAOs are at the forefront of technological innovation and open many exciting possibilities for how organizations might be increasingly run soon.\nIn this blog, we discuss some of these possibilities taking shape for DAOs and their implications.\nOne of the first use cases for DAOs was as an investment vehicle. A group of people would organize a particular type of DAO structure and use their preferred voting rights to choose portfolios of assets. Each member would contribute to a shared treasury and profit proportionally to the contributions they made towards buying the assets.\nIn some cases, these DAOs became very successful when allocating to NFTs, tokens, and other crypto assets. Now, there is a new logical extension from the initial DAO investment vehicle, which looks at asset tokenization.\nReal-world assets hold a lot of promise for decentralized or distributed blockchain technology. In this sector, there are groups of DAOs that select a type of good, commodity, or other asset and tokenize them to be traded on a given blockchain. These are some of the main forces driving asset tokenization in many networks.\nAsset tokenization enables businesses, organizations, and investors to tokenize or represent physical assets such as real estate, and non-physical assets such as stocks and bonds, as digital tokens issued on a blockchain. This enables much more liquidity for the asset, fractionalized trading of the asset, opens access to a wider range of global investors, facilitates transactions, enhances transparency of the asset and transactions, and provides faster settlement, among other benefits.\nRead more: What is asset tokenization?\nThere are DAOs for tokenizing real estate, gold, silver, intellectual property, vintage wine, and many more real-world assets. In 2024, these efforts will expand and bring blockchain technology to a new market as tokenization starts to gain more traction in blockchain and business circles.\nIn 2023, governments have started to create frameworks and regulate tokenization and financial institutions have expressed supportive views about tokenization as a new vehicle for business growth.\nIdentity has been one of the most anticipated technologies in blockchain for a while. As a decentralized blockchain enables instant verification on a peer-to-peer level, the idea of being able to have an identity outside the control of central parties and fully owned and controlled by the person is revolutionary. In this respect, there are many efforts to deliver on this promise.\nDAOs are taking a step in this field as well. There are many DAOs creating identity management tools, pseudo-anonymity solutions, wallets to hold identities and tokens, and also privacy protection wallets. All these tools are built around decentralized identity which can be very important in 2024.\nThese days, user privacy is valued more than ever before due to the increasing amount of security breaches and data hacks of centralized organizations. More people are understanding the importance of how identity is managed and recorded on the internet.\nAccording to DataProt, 43 of people globally feel that they lack control over their personal information with many users increasingly distrustful of centralized entities having access to their data.\nHere DAOs have an advantage, as they are managing people s information by their very nature. As the technology of decentralized identity improves, the DAOs creating products around it will increasingly stand out in the market.\nThe rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), neural networks, vectorial databases, and a whole host of other technologies related to Artificial Intelligence have revived the need for decentralized computing. Today, AI is mostly run by centralized data centers that have bought powerful GPUs to process parallel computations.\nThese data centers are controlled by a handful of people in the world and are quickly becoming a monopoly. These not only restrict who can use AI tools, but they also control the information used to train the various models behind AI technology.\nMany DAOs have been created to manage decentralized computing networks. In them, regular users delegate some of the computing power of their local machine in exchange for tokens that reward them for their computational power.\nThese networks can leverage the power of the crowd to open GPU, storage, and computational power to AI developers who don t want to be controlled by the centralized players in the world of cloud computing. These DAOs are a massive promise for the future of AI and computational technology itself.\nAnother major development in the future of DAOs is their relationship with national governments. Much of the unlocked potential of DAOs is due to their uncertain legal status in most countries. Yet, this is set to start to change in 2024, in some jurisdictions.\nThe European Union is preparing to launch a comprehensive overhaul for crypto assets called Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The law does not have any direct provisions for DAOs, but when a DAO issues crypto tokens sold in the EU, they will have to comply with the financial regulations contained in MiCA.\nIn the United States, things are even less clear. Some states have legalized the DAO, such as Wyoming, but the legal status is not recognized at the federal level. The DAOs registered in that state are in limbo and may have to wait until a legal case challenges the Wyoming law that gives them protections.\nRead more: DeFi and global regulations\nA more positive country when it comes to the subject is Japan. In 2023, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) released a Web3 white paper that signals a more open disposition by the country s ruling party towards crypto, including frameworks to recognize DAOs as legal entities in Japan. Things are still under consideration, but given the desire to make Japan a leader in Web3, there is gaining support for clarity and approval.\nLooking for a simple way to receive Cardano ecosystem news and announcements?\nFollow EMURGO on X for everything you need to know about Cardano including informative blogs, events, blockchain courses, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "completion": "August 3, 2023\nEMURGO\nContents\nYoroi Wallet, EMURGO s open-source light wallet for Cardano, is packed with features that help users get the most security out of their wallets.\nIn this blog, we ll look at Yoroi Wallet s self-custody feature and discuss how it helps our users keep their assets safe.\nYoroi is a self-custody crypto wallet, meaning users have their digital assets, allowing users to always have complete control over their ADA and other Cardano native assets.\nSelf-custody refers to individuals or entities directly managing and securing their digital assets, without relying on third-party custodians, such as an exchange.\nThe concept emphasizes that an individual should maintain personal control over their crypto wallet s private key, eliminating the need to depend on others for this crucial task.\nSelf-custody fosters an understanding of potential risks, motivating users to educate themselves on optimal cybersecurity and asset management strategies, as well as empowering individuals to assume accountability for the protection of their digital assets.\nControl: Self-custody provides complete control over funds without relying on third-party custodians. Users have direct access to their assets, enabling them to transact, store, and manage them as they see fit.\nSecurity: Self-custody offers enhanced security by eliminating the risk of a centralized third party being hacked, going bankrupt, or engaging in fraudulent activity, as your assets are protected by your private keys, which are under your control.\nPrivacy: Avoiding centralized platforms through self-custody not only safeguards privacy and anonymity but also enables users to keep their transactions and financial activities confidential, thereby securing their personal and sensitive information. Despite the visibility and traceability of transactions on the blockchain, users identity remains private.\nDecentralization: Self-custody aligns with the principles of decentralization; it empowers individuals by removing the need for intermediaries, and promotes the distribution of power and authority away from centralized entities. Self-custody wallets enable you to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi).\nAutonomy: Self-custody bolsters financial independence by enabling users to manage and transact their assets without third-party constraints, thereby offering enhanced freedom and adaptability. This autonomy also facilitates interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain.\nRead more: The importance of self-custodial staking in Cardano\nSelf-custody represents a significant aspect of the evolving landscape of digital asset management and is considered by many as a crucial component for the future.\nWhile it may not be the only approach, it aligns with the core principles of decentralization, security, and individual empowerment that underpin the crypto industry as a whole.\nWhile self-custody may not be suitable for everyone, it necessitates individuals to assume full responsibility for their security protocols, including the management of private keys and the implementation of protective measures, thereby placing the onus of asset security entirely on the user.\nUltimately, the choice to self-custody depends on the individual s preferences, risk tolerance, and technical capabilities but it is ideal if you are looking to gain control over your own digital assets.\nNow that we have covered the benefits of self-custody, head over to https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/ to take your next step toward financial independence and autonomy.\nAvailable for both desktop and mobile, Yoroi is your gateway to the financial world and the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.\nKnowledge - October 10, 2024\nKnowledge - October 8, 2024\nKnowledge - October 3, 2024\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

    "prompt": "Decentralization in Cardano?",
    "completion": "June 8, 2023\nEMURGO\nKeep in mind that these topics only provide educational information and are in no way financial advice.\nDecentralization is a core ethos of the global blockchain community which plays a big part in the overall Web3 movement. Yet, it s often misunderstood and can sometimes be confusing, especially to blockchain and crypto beginners in the community.\nAs the Web3 movement gains more adoption by individuals and organizations, the focus will increasingly be placed on the level of decentralization of any given blockchain protocol. This creates design, regulatory, and adoption ramifications.\nLet s explore decentralization in blockchain further, especially Cardano decentralization, and how this affects the future of Cardano.\nDecentralization is the distribution of functions, decision-making, and information away from a centralizing single entity (be it an individual, organization, group, or consortium) and into a network of participants.\nThere are both technical aspects and governance considerations when it comes to decentralization.\nIn the technology world, decentralization is more of a spectrum than a binary property. For example, services like Twitter, Netflix, Facebook, etc. have some characteristics of a decentralized system. Each of these apps has nodes (data servers) that relay information to each other, and they have to go through a consensus round to display tweets on a user s feed, for example.\nHowever, the key difference is that in the systems above, there are central nodes that can force certain decisions and overrule other nodes. In those cases, that type of network architecture is known as distributed. Decentralization, on the other hand, can be thought of as a step further beyond distributed.\nIn a decentralized system, the nodes are not able to force any decisions on the other nodes. Every new decision or action taken by the network has to be the result of a consensus round. For this reason, decentralized networks are censorship-resistant and also permissionless in that anyone can join the network and run a node.\nThe most popular blockchains aim to be open-source and decentralized. Depending on the blockchain network, they can utilize different types of consensus. For example:\nCompared to a centralized network, decentralization offers many advantages:\nThere are many ways to consider decentralization and measure it although this is an evolving concept at the moment due to blockchain s emerging tech status.\nUntil then, we ll have to use some metrics to approximate decentralization. One of the most common is the number of validator nodes.\nIn Cardano as of the moment, there are more than 3,150 stake pools that are running for users to delegate their stake and help secure the network in a decentralized manner. These validators are found all around the planet, making the Cardano network a very decentralized and permissionless network for everyone.\nFurthermore, as an open-source decentralized blockchain, many developers are building decentralized applications projects on the network that allows anyone to use their project s services, with more than 120 projects already launched and more than 1,240 projects currently building [1].\nMost of the industry is focused on what decentralization means in terms of technology such as the number of nodes, the safety guarantees of the consensus protocol, etc. Very few have considered other aspects.\nAt the start, we stated that decision-making was part of decentralization. But this aspect has less to do with technology and more to do with the governance structure of the network or blockchain by its stakeholders.\nAs of now and in the future, the Cardano network is focusing on governance by the worldwide community of Cardano developers, stake pool operators, academics, and other users. The objective is to put Cardano squarely into the hands of the community to run with a Constitution, governing bodies, voting rules, and other details after rounds of discussion and debate with the community.\nIn Cardano, this focus on community governance is the main pillar of its Voltaire era. As part of this era, there is a proposal called CIP-1694 which seeks to confirm many of the details mentioned above about how the Cardano network will be governed moving forward and to have it be a sustainable network.\nCIP-1694 which is the on-chain governance component of Cardano is supported by Intersect, a Cardano member-based organization that will serve as Cardano s off-chain governance component to steward the Cardano ecosystem forward with decentralized governance by its members. The Cardano Constitution will also be another pillar that will serve as the guiding document to lay out the decentralized framework and policies of the Cardano ecosystem.\nIn the long run, this will brand Cardano as not only a decentralized blockchain network from a technological perspective but also a community governance one, and become a main technological platform of the Web3 movement.\nRead more: All you need to know about Cardano s Voltaire era\nTo stay on top of the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - October 10, 2024\nKnowledge - October 8, 2024\nKnowledge - October 3, 2024\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

    "prompt": "Here Are 5 Useful Tools for Cardano Developers EMURGO?",
    "completion": "November 23, 2023\nEMURGO\nThe Cardano blockchain network is rapidly developing and expanding each year with more developer tools being made available. Numerous dApp projects have launched on Cardano providing DeFi and NFT services and more on the way. This means more and more blockchain developers are jumping into the Cardano ecosystem.\nOf course, this inflow of new developers needs to be matched by new development tools. These tools have to make the experience friendlier, faster, and agile so that the network can expand with new services.\nCardano has met this challenge and there are many developer tools ready for use. Virtually all of them were developed primarily for Cardano, so they simplify many tasks for developers creating dApps.\nHere are 5 useful tools in no particular order for Cardano developers to access and utilize for their dApps.\nThe first platform we ll discuss is Atlas. It s a tool for deploying off-chain code using Haskell. It helps with building transactions, balancing UTxOs, and interfacing with Plutus smart contracts. It was initially created as a private tool for a popular dApp on Cardano, Genius Yield, but the team decided to open it for all Cardano developers.\nAdditionally, they improved it with the help of other Cardano developers such as MLabs, Well-Typed, and Plank. All this makes Atlas one of the most complete solutions for the off-chain code required by Cardano dApps.\nAnother advantage provided by Atlas is that it allows developers to test the logic of the code. The platform can run unit tests that provide ways to asses:\nFinally, Atlas has a more complex set of integration tests. Unit tests work on a local environment where transaction conditions are simulated but don t model the behavior of a dApp in a live network.\nAtlas provides a repository that can be used to spin a private network modeled after Cardano. There the transactions and interactions by the code are more real as they simulate a network that is producing blocks and has other transactions running in it.\nThis gives developers more opportunities to test a dApp before using one of the Cardano test networks. That way most major bugs can be caught before anything is launched on a public forum.\nMaestro is a blockchain data provider for Cardano dApps. It s able to gather information about the current state of the blockchain and input that into a dApp live on Cardano. The platform also provides information for consumers.\nThe dashboard created by Maestro provides an overview of each Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) running on Cardano. This data helps the community make a choice about which projects are best to delegate their ADA.\nFor Cardano developers, Maestro facilitates the launch of an ISPO with minimal time and effort. The ISPO has become a common tool for projects to bootstrap their expenses, gain users, and improve their reputations.\nNow, when it comes to developing dApps, Maestro offers three unique features:\nAll of these tools allow us to reduce the development time of a Cardano dApp. It also makes the job of developers easier by giving them quick access to the state of the Cardano network at any given time.\nRead more: EMURGO Ventures invests in Maestro\nDemeter is a developer tool to set up a Cardano developer environment quickly and run on the cloud. It provides the extensions necessary to interact with the ledger without any further configuration, plus a list of starter code examples for education purposes.\nThe entire environment runs on the cloud which allows developer teams that work remotely to quickly share code. It gives fast access to the Cardano Node running on the same cloud cluster. For both the main network and the test networks, projects can query on-chain data and also submit data to the ledger.\nThe project is the perfect solution for development teams that require to set up environments quickly. It s also the perfect educational tool for students not knowledgeable enough to set up an environment or lack the computational resources to launch one locally.\nOrcfax, is an oracle tool designed for the Cardano network. Data that is outside the ledger is very difficult to introduce into a live network in a way that is reliable and difficult to game.\nThe Orcfax platform has several features that help with this problem, such as:\nAll these attributes make Orcfax one of the best information providers for Cardano dApps. It is a project that aims to change how data from the outside world enters the blockchain with an exclusive Cardano approach.\nThis is our list of some of the developer tools available to the Cardano ecosystem. It s by no means an exhaustive look, as there are several right now live on the network. Each has its strengths and can be a game changer for developers looking to build on Cardano.\nAs the ecosystem evolves, we ll keep a close watch and try to showcase more of these great tools. The community has truly shown its power by creating a whole host of developer tools that put Cardano ahead of the industry when it comes to the developer tool ecosystem.\nAgora is a governance module for Cardano dApps. Many projects want to use the DAO model to make decisions and manage resources. DAOs are also great ways to grow a community and attract users to a project s token. All these reasons make governance an attractive proposition for developers.\nYet, developing voting systems, proposal management, token balance tracking, and many other things needed for a functioning DAO can be time-consuming and outside the expertise of many developers.\nThis is where Agora comes in, it s a complete set of smart contracts and add-ons that can provide governance solutions to any project. This means Cardano developers don t have to invent all the tools from scratch, they just need to deploy the tools built by Agora.\nAre you new to Cardano and want to learn more about building dApps on Cardano?\nLooking for professional instruction to guide you through a full course on Cardano dApp development?\nThen, visit EMURGO Academy, EMURGO s education unit, to learn more about blockchain education courses and to enroll now.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

By prioritizing investments, delivering continuous education, and building infrastructure, we aim to unlock the full potential of the Cardano ecosystem.\nEMURGO wants to work with current Cardano projects and help them hit their targets. Also, move projects from Web 2.0 to the blockchain industry, focused on the Cardano network. EMURGO Academy was also highlighted, it has certified 2500 learners in blockchain technology and will continue to expand its offering.\nThe presentation closed with some important announcements. EMURGO will launch an auditing service to review and help secure smart contracts. The future of Yoroi Wallet was also shown, with the next stage becoming a headless crypto wallet.\nThe Cardano Summit was packed with important announcements. The ecosystem has grown rapidly since the last summit and it s accelerating as we speak. EMURGO has played a major role in this expansion, and it will expand its offering in the future. The next summit will be even bigger for the Cardano community.\nWatch Nikhil s presentation below.\nEMURGO announced a strategic partnership with NMKR during the summit. The objective is to increase the tokenization of real-world assets on the Cardano network in the form of NFTs. Additionally, both entities want to amplify brand increase marketing efforts, and lead generation through Events, PR, Social and Global Media Partnerships and also strategic access and localization of NMKR to Asian markets, new business development, and integrated partnerships for the platform s user expansion.\nWatch the Cardano Summit 2023 recap video below.\nAt the main stage, during the first day of the Cardano Summit, Yosuke Yoshida, Co-CEO of EMURGO Middle East and Africa gave the community an update regarding all the initiatives underway in Africa and the growing Web3 landscape on the continent. Yoshida leads EMURGO s efforts in the Middle East and Africa, making him an important piece in the overall aim of Cardano.\nAfrica represents a major market of expansion as the continent s population is very young, 97 of them below 65 years of age. This is coupled with mobile network coverage which at the moment stands at around 46 and is the preferred way to access the internet in the continent.\nThe Co-CEO of EMURGO then elaborated on the blockchain and Web3 technologies and their use cases for the African continent. One clear example, is stablecoins have started to play a major part in the regions, especially to those lacking access to regular financial services and dealing with high transaction fees in the legacy banking system. Users can go to the stablecoins to protect themselves against local currency depreciation, as well as, use it for remittances.\nTo quote him directly:\nMy interest gradually grew towards the emerging markets. Why? Because I thought and we thought that technology and blockchain, it makes much more sense in the emerging markets than in the developed markets\nOne highlight of the blockchain applications in Africa came from Nigeria. One Nigerian startup developed a system to use blockchain and settle intra-banking transactions, which has been a major source of over costs for users and a major inefficiency in the financial sector. Some banks in the country have adopted such a solution.\nThis integration of blockchain with real-world applications has changed the perception Africans have of the technology. In the West, it is seen as a speculative asset class or a vehicle for scams. In Africa, on the other hand, users in Nigeria see it as the future of money, while in other parts as an alternative to the traditional financial system.\nEMURGO has seized the opportunity and invested in the last 3 years in 40+ companies across Africa, a majority of them ready to build on Cardano and use it as a base for their tokens. Yosuke Yoshida highlighted the variety of offerings in Africa such as Nodo, EMURGO Labs, EMURGO Kepple Ventures, and Adaverse among many others.\nFinally, EMURGO along with PWC has released a report that details more of the developments in Africa. One conclusion is that the continent won t follow the same path as developed nations, instead, they ll adopt the latest advancements and leapfrog over other regions. Blockchain technology is among these key technologies, and Cardano along with EMURGO is best poised to help the African continent with this project.\nWatch Yoshida s full presentation below.\nSebastian Zilliacus from Cardano Spot gave an update on the project. In Web 2.0 there is an environment of censorship, lack of control over data, poor monetization, and even possibly being blocked by certain governments.\nSocial networks that work in the Web 3.0 space can solve all these problems and create a fairer playing field for content creators and content consumers. But it s still in its infancy, blockchain social networks still lack good user experience, clear regulations, network effects, and education on how to use them.\nCardano Spot is moving in these areas. It has already completed 3 phases of development and the 4th one will bring: open access out of its beta state, Cardano Wiki, content ownership, gamification, rewards systems, and enhanced content discovery. The Cardano Spot platform will be the trailblazer of the social networks on Web 3.0.\nWatch Sebastian s full presentation below.\nIn an exciting first, the Cardano Summit hosted the Battle of the Builders. It was a live challenge where ten teams took to the stage to create a solution on Cardano, the teams participating included: NMKR, NEWM, Xerberus, Fida, Mehen Finance, Iagon, ZKFOLD, Maestro, and TVVIN.\nTakashi Hayashida from EMURGO Ventures was one of the judges for the competition. In the end, there were three winners: 1st place Maestro, 2nd place NEWM, and 3rd place ZKFold.

    "prompt": "Exploring the Yoroi Wallet Creative Process?",
    "completion": "May 23, 2023\nEMURGO\nA Behind-the-Scenes with Dima Kuznets, Product Designer for Yoroi Wallet\nJoin us for an interview with our UX/UI designer Dima Kuznets for a glimpse into how the Yoroi Wallet came to be and learn about some of its unique features.\nWhat is your background before joining EMURGO?\nDima: I have been working in product design for more than 5 years. I ve created various custom large-scale interface solutions for companies including Big Four accounting firms, WPP the world s #1 multinational ad company, several Fortune 500 companies, and several leading automotive brands. I m passionate about public initiatives, volunteering, and education. My volunteering efforts include assisting in the creation of the Kyiv Map of Renovation (a platform that helps preserve the historical heritage of Ukraine s capital city), supporting charitable funds, and mentoring students in design school.\nDescribe your role at EMURGO and describe your role in building the Yoroi Wallet.\nDima: I m a Product Designer at EMURGO. When it comes to the Yoroi Wallet, my responsibilities include:\nWhat purpose does the Yoroi Wallet play in the larger Cardano ecosystem?\nDima: Yoroi is the first light wallet in the ecosystem to demonstrate to the entire community that the crypto experience can be much faster and easier than the status quo. Instead of installing and maintaining complex full-node wallets like Daedalus, users can add, send, receive, and stake ADA with significantly less effort and immediate results.\nBecause Yoroi is being created in the open by EMURGO, one of the founding entities of Cardano, it plays a significant role in the ecosystem by providing a safe transparent place for users funds following the highest blockchain standards. Additionally, our open-source wallet has been a reference point for other project owners building wallet-adjacent products and infrastructure. Our product design team continues to work diligently to provide a top-notch user experience transparently.\nWhat kind of research did you/the team conduct before building the wallet? Did you identify any features you liked or that you felt were missing that you wanted to bring to the user experience for Cardano users?\nDima: Light wallets are great because they can run on many types of devices, notably smartphones. Users can experience all the advantages of the Cardano network without their device slowing them down or adding any extra complications. The EMURGO product, design, and tech teams performed market, user, and financial research before building Yoroi. We spent hundreds of hours in collaborative workshops for ideation, alignment, and synthesis. We also held regular retrospective sessions to understand what we were missing and what we could improve as a team. I strongly believe that a well-organized team is a key driver for success.\nAt a time when the Cardano network is rapidly developing, new DeFi solutions are quickly appearing, and customer needs are swiftly growing, Yoroi is poised to completely revise the wallet experience from tech-oriented to user-oriented. We are focusing on the integration of highly demanded features, such as an NFT gallery, native swap functions, and more advanced staking. Yoroi will continue to evolve as the team continues to predict and respond to the community s wants and needs. We ll also ensure to keep all the things that make Yoroi compliant with the highest web3 security standards.\nWhat features have you added to make Yoroi more approachable for new users?\nDima: Most noticeably, we have simplified the interface, shifting from the typical tech-oriented error-based interface to one that is user-oriented. Every feature both standard wallet features that have been redesigned for Yoroi, and new features unique to the wallet is provided with well-thought-out design solutions based on market best practices and community feedback. User testing sessions and surveys encourage users to get involved in the process of creating a perfect tool for their daily crypto operations.\nRight now, Yoroi provides most of the required functions in the main navigation screen, making them always visible to the user, and each specific feature has its own unique and consistent internal navigation and structure. The ability to quickly hide your balance everywhere makes it safer to use Yoroi in public places. The color design, calm grayscale colors combined with the blue Yoroi brand, makes the wallet unique and memorable.\nHow will Yoroi save users time?\nDima: Our key design goal was to help users perform tasks with fewer actions, less interface load, and more personalization. We want our users to access and use their wallets more efficiently. With Yoroi, creating, restoring, and connecting wallets, as well as transaction speed, will become super fast and even more intuitive. Users will also enjoy a more personalized experience, which will include additional settings, contextual hints, and a certain level of customization.\nWas Yoroi designed for Web3 newcomers, hardcore DeFi traders, NFT collectors, or someone else? What balance did you strike between simplicity and capability?\nDima: Right now, Yoroi is designed primarily for power users, but we want to make Yoroi 2.0 accessible to everyone. Customization is important to us. While some extra settings might help hardcore DeFi traders and NFT collectors fulfill their needs faster, they can also be a real burden for Web3 newcomers. So we are striving to make the interface adjustable, as per users needs, and make Yoroi an iconic crypto wallet for everyone even those who don t know what crypto is. Designing Yoroi 2.0 to be inclusive will help us to grow the community and give users the ability to grow from using the basics to leveraging advanced DeFi features.\nRead more: How EMURGO Product Designer Dima transitioned his career to Cardano\nAre there any unique UX features introduced by Yoroi that you d like to highlight?\nDima: Although we are just at the beginning of Yoroi 2.0, features such as the wallet dashboard on Yoroi mobile and the NFT gallery provide faster and simpler navigation, more approachable key functions, and great value to our users. Yoroi also stands out by automating the collateral process (a process that ensures transactions execute successfully). Rather than requiring users to manually lock up the necessary amount of ADA, Yoroi will automatically take the amount required for collateral from existing UTXOs. This feature enhances our user experience when interacting with Cardano dApps.\nThe new staking dashboard, which includes separated sections on the web, helps users better navigate the staking process. We also made the wallet restoration process extremely fast and easy. When entering a phrase, users can use traditional keyboard shortcuts to speed up the process. This is just the start of our revamp journey and we ll be releasing dozens of cool updates pretty soon.\nHow will EMURGO leverage its native wallet to provide a more seamless experience for the Cardano community? Tell us about some of the synergies between Yoroi and other EMURGO offerings.\nDima: EMURGO Fintech s solutions are built to increase connectivity across the blockchain and traditional financial services ecosystems, beginning with the Cardano network. These financial services products will harness the value and full potential of the Cardano blockchain for our community.\nEMURGO s Yoroi Wallet is working on integrating with many well-known DApps and DEXes, which will help consolidate all DeFi activities in one place with the top level of security. Our users already enjoy interaction with some of Cardano s popular DEXs and dApps like Minswap, Muesliswap, NMKR and Taptools, and so on. In the meantime, EMURGO s USDA stablecoin & Yoroi Wallet integration will help to bridge the gap between the fiat and crypto worlds, allowing people to exchange their native coins for fiat and vice versa in minutes and with the lowest fees.\nWant to connect to the greater Cardano ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and other dApps?\nWant to easily send, receive, store, and stake ADA?

    "prompt": "NFT Insights Premium Spirits EMURGO?",
    "completion": "February 20, 2024\nEMURGO\nReal-world asset tokenization is gaining popularity in the blockchain industry as one of the next major catalysts for blockchain adoption. This is coupled with the fact that more and more industries have already been adopting or experimenting with decentralized blockchain technology to help reduce costs, improve supply chains, attract new clients, and prove the origin of a specific user product.\nThe heightened interest and awareness of NFTs have laid the foundation for mainstream businesses and creators to start getting involved in asset tokenization in the years to come. More tokenization applications and platforms are now available in the market and more users have come into the blockchain space.\nOne of the sectors leading the way in this effort is the premium spirits segment within the alcoholic beverage industry. It s a type of market segment well-suited for NFTs and asset tokenization, as many high-end spirit brands have exclusively sold their products each year that are meant as collectible items for an exclusive consumer sector.\nIn this blog, we ll review the current state of NFTs and tokenization in the premium spirits sector, showcase how these are solving unique business challenges, and discuss the future of asset tokenization in the premium spirits and alcoholic beverage industry.\nLuxury spirits are a sector of the alcoholic beverages business that aims to create unique, exclusive batches of different spirits. These come in limited numbers per year and are bought by passionate collectors all over the world. Many estimates forecast that this market will reach $123.4 billion by the end of 2027. This makes it one of the fastest-growing sectors in the luxury goods industry.\nThis incredible growth has also attracted many unscrupulous actors looking to profit off of this surge in consumer interest. Today, nearly 30 of the alcohol produced in the luxury market is considered to be fraudulent. As a common practice, the bottles and containers used by the high-end spirits are collected and refilled with a cheaper alternative and then sold for the same price in the secondary market.\nRelated reading:\nThese fake alcohols cost the spirits market and alcoholic beverages industry approximately $3 billion US dollars every year. Not only that, but these fake bottles can be very dangerous with alcohol not suited for human consumption which results in serious potential health problems.\nThe need for product authenticity via an NFT certification issued by a high-end spirit brand makes this a prime real use case for asset tokenization. Through an NFT or digital token, consumers can instantly verify the authenticity of their purchased high-end spirit, receive its tracking information, and also transact instantly on a global scale with like-minded collectors. As a result, high-end spirit brands also gain from the increased trust in their products, reach a new young consumer base on a global level, and enhance the marketability of their brand.\nThis mechanism would be a form of real-world asset tokenization using a decentralized blockchain such as Cardano.\nHypothetically, when a user buys an NFT or token representing a bottle of a high-end spirit they are not buying its mere digital image. Rather, they are purchasing the physical bottle itself. However, the new physical possession isn t directly shipped to the person when the transaction is confirmed. Instead, it s kept in reserve by the distillery. The NFT or token is then used as a certificate of purchase and it confirms that the said bottle has an owner.\nAt this stage, the consumer or buyer has some other options.\nThe ID of each high-end spirit bottle is contained in the technical NFT metadata. This enables collectors to confirm if the bottle has already been opened or consumed via this registry. If a bottle is found among the NFTs burned, this indicates that it was already consumed by a user at some previous point and that the bottle on sale is most likely fake.\nFurthermore, each year of a harvest for a particular alcohol vintage can be represented as a collection of NFTs. As more of these vintages are consumed over time, the rarer the unopened bottles become, and by extension, the NFTs in that collection. The track of inventory automatically updates, increasing the value of the individual tokens in each collection.\nCollectors can see in real-time which of the vintages are depleting faster. The owners of these bottles can also plan when it is optimal to sell a particular NFT with the associated bottle. The system services both parties in the market.\nThe NFT matches the uniqueness of a one-of-a-kind rare spirit with ideally each distillery holding a physical bottle and its NFT representation in a 1-to-1 ratio. This means each bottle is a unique experience that is captured by the token on-chain. Each NFT represents these experiences that won t repeat once the spirit is consumed.\nThe above-mentioned NFT collections sold out despite the hefty price tag for each of the bottles. They are all test beds for a new wave of NFT utility that has already proved its commercial viability and also consumer success.\nAt first, the merging of these two industries might seem far-fledged, but upon closer inspection, they are an ideal match. Both complement each other and can solve problems currently faced by the luxury spirit market. It s still very early in this new frontier, but the path has already been made for more success.\nAre you a fan of NMKR and its Cardano NFT platform?\nWant to stay updated on EMURGO s partnership with NMKR and its drive to raise awareness of asset tokenization on NMKR?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to easily receive updates about the partnership and future initiatives with NMKR to drive Cardano NFT usage for asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "Asset Tokenization 101 EMURGO?",
    "completion": "February 27, 2024\nEMURGO\nBlockchain has grown in many ways, beyond its initial use as a technology platform for censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer payments. It has now been used to develop products and solutions for cross-border remittances and settlements, logistics, product authenticity, and many more applications.\nNowadays, one of the most promising use cases for blockchain is asset tokenization. Asset tokenization enables a business, organization, or individual to take assets, such as commodities, contracts, manufactured goods, and real estate, and represent them as digital tokens on a blockchain platform.\nThis gives traditional assets a tokenized medium to move around and much broader market access to an expanded variety of financial products that previously were unavailable. Asset tokenization has the potential to overhaul entire traditional industries and change the way commerce is done all over the world by making traditional assets more liquid and opening the doors for instantaneous global investment while enhancing the transparency and security of transactions.\nAsset tokenization is a way to convert and represent the value and ownership of physical, intellectual, or financial assets via digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain platform that runs 24/7 and is censorship-resistant. These tokens can represent a whole single unit of the asset, or in some cases, fractions of said assets which can then be sold and owned by interested users around the world.\nAsset tokenization removes geographical borders, minimizes transaction costs, expands markets, increases transparency, and brings a whole new host of investors to previously restricted asset classes due to its digital nature.\nThese tokens can be traded on exchanges, marketplaces, and peer-to-peer using wallets to hold such tokens.\nGenerally speaking, asset tokenization is conducted through the following series of steps:\nFirst, a party or user must identify the asset or asset class that is going to be tokenized. Physical assets are going to have different characteristics than digital ones. Financial products that are digital (stocks, bonds, derivatives) are subject to regulatory laws that have to be followed.\nAll this information must be collected and taken into account for the tokenization of the asset. The regulatory question especially limits the people and organizations who can buy and trade these tokens representing regulated securities.\nOnce the characteristics of the asset are defined, the next step is to choose the best type of token for the asset. The question boils down to two options, whether it is a fungible and non-fungible asset.\nThe fungible token type best suits assets that don t have any differences in their supply. In most cases, there is one that best fits this classification currency. For example, there is no real difference between one dollar and another dollar. These days, fiat-backed stablecoins are a common example where a fungible token makes sense and is increasingly being used due to its ease of transactions.\nMost tokenized assets use the non-fungible or NFT token type. This is because NFTs are more versatile when representing goods outside the blockchain because they can have metadata (readable information about the asset included within the token) adjusted for each token in an NFT group or collection. Many physical assets and intellectual properties are unique and different from one another, such as a diamond or vintage wine bottle.\nRelated reading\nNFTs can be used to tokenize equities, commodities, derivatives, securities, fine art, carbon credits, intellectual property, or any type of asset where there are important differences among them.\nFor example, stocks need to represent not only the company they come from but also the year issued, the dividend paid, and any other characteristic that doesn t make them a uniform whole. The same is true for commodities, art pieces, etc.\nNext, the party or user must match the supply of the token to the asset it will represent. In some cases, fractionalization of the asset makes sense. Big ticket items such as art pieces might be too expensive for a single individual to buy as a whole, but NFTs are a potential solution to this problem.\nAsset fractionalization is where a single NFT is divided into pieces that can be sold to multiple users. The pieces represent a fraction of the whole and can appreciate in value by the same percentage as the whole item the NFT represents. This opens up transactions and access to a much wider range of potential investors, providing liquidity for the seller and investment opportunities for the buyer.\nAsset tokenization can implement an oracle or data feed to provide accurate information about the item, custody, and ownership to the blockchain. Oracles bridge the off-chain and the on-chain world and can provide verifiable and reliable information for the asset to represent its real-world counterpart.\nFinally, the tokenization of the asset must be legally reviewed to ensure it complies with regulatory frameworks, and/or an audit of the asset tokenization can also be done by a reputable, neutral third party not involved in the development of the tokenized asset. This allows it to be impartial when auditing the code and the logic behind the smart contract. If opting for an audit, It s important to select a reputable auditing firm and have the report for the audit made public so that investors can verify and trust the tokenization process.\nThere are too many asset classes to individually account for, but there are generally two categories where they will fit: tangible and digital assets.\nIn most cases, users will be able to look at the metadata of each tokenized asset to see its history of ownership, issuance, and any other important related information to verify the authenticity of the asset. This provides transparency for the buyer and legitimacy to the seller.\nAre you looking for more information on tokenization using blockchain technology?\nEMURGO is partnered with NFT and Tokenization platform NMKR to drive adoption and awareness of the ease and valuable utility of asset tokenization, especially for businesses and creators.\nFollow EMURGO on X to receive updates about the partnership and future events with NMKR.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "completion": "May 14, 2024\nEMURGO\nDePINs (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) are a relatively new field of blockchain technology that is increasing in awareness.\nWhile much attention has been given to real-world asset tokenization, NFTs, and DeFi, the benefits of DePINs also present more real use cases for blockchain.\nThese days, everyday consumer items utilize a connective network infrastructure that is usually provided and administered by centralized parties. These include cellphone networks, the internet, supply chains, water and electricity, and more. Some of these infrastructure networks undoubtedly benefit from having a centralized actor to make for more efficient processes in distribution.\nHowever, some networks could benefit from having a more decentralized structure for reasons related to security, accountability, transparency, and more.\nThis is where DePINs can offer a potential solution.\nLet s dig deeper into DePINs and their different types.\nBlockchain technology has been around for more than a decade and is being looked at or used for a wide range of potential uses in finance, supply chains, data management, and more. Decentralized blockchain technology, in particular, provides a digital way to transparently record and store vital information in a trustless manner without a need for a centralized administrator through the distribution and upkeep of this information on a network of nodes (servers) that are incentivized to maintain the network in the form of a cryptocurrency or digital token.\nRelated reading:\nThis unique property has the potential to provide benefits for many businesses and industries where data keeping can be securely and reliably automated with accountability and transparency. Centralized actors and certain stakeholders would need to be less relied upon by others to faithfully carry out their responsibilities.\nThis brings us to DePINs which applies the beneficial properties of decentralized blockchain technology and digital tokens to infrastructure networks.\nInstead of having a centralized party pay upfront and control a network, a group can use reward incentives to bootstrap or build a new type of network or distribution channel.\nIndividual users would be incentivized in the form of digital tokens to participate in DePINs by lending their hardware to increase overall network connectivity and expand coverage. Those who provide access where the network has not yet developed can get more token rewards than those located in areas with network coverage. Tokens can be used for other transactions as well.\nThe result would be a self-organizing infrastructure network that incentivizes expansion via user participation, instead of a large upfront investment by a centralized entity. DePINs offer a potential new model that merges network infrastructure construction and maintenance with digital blockchain technology.\nDePINs can be extended to many types of network infrastructure.\nGenerally, it can divided into two camps:\nBoth types of networks require resources to be built. This is where the incentivization mechanism is used.\nThese require hardware to multiply and provide coverage to an industry, geographical area, or economic activity. In a traditional model, these networks would be deployed by a company paying the investment upfront keeping all the profits for itself, and also trying to gather as much user data as possible.\nIn a DePIN model, the hardware deployments could be tracked by a digital blockchain.\nOnce a new device connects to the network, the user who placed it begins receiving a reward from the network itself. Users are rewarded by deploying hardware in areas with low coverage, naturally extending the reach of the service.\nOne example is IoT devices.\nA blockchain-based project using DePINs can reward users who place nodes that allow the network to track shipment across regions. This allows the company to track its shipments faster and cheaper. The users get more rewards by deploying sensors along the different shipment routes.\nIn time, the network would extend its coverage until it covers all the shipment routes that companies use to move cargo. The network charges the companies for the service and distributes the rewards to everyone maintaining the nodes.\nIf new routes were to open, the users could react by deploying more sensors and getting higher early rewards. This creates a network that can potentially self-expand and quickly reshape to cover new areas of economic activity.\nAnother type of DePIN network is in digital infrastructure.\nThe idea is to have a network able to provide a service delivered via the Internet. This is where computational resources are shared to a larger whole.\nOne example is decentralized storage networks such as AIOZ Network.\nIn decentralized storage, users delegate a portion of their hard drives to these networks which in turn, rent the space to other users looking to store information.\nThe network can encrypt the stored data and divide it into smaller chunks. No one computer has a copy of the data of the users, so theoretically, there is more privacy in decentralized storage than when using cloud solutions.\nThese decentralized storage networks use digital token incentives to attract more delegators. Those looking to buy storage space need to pay with that network s token, creating a circular economy.\nInterested in learning more DePINs and use cases for blockchain technology?\nEMURGO is a supporter of AIOZ Network s launch of its W3IPFS (Web3 Interplanetary File System) solution, a decentralized, secure, high-speed, and scalable file storage solution powered by 74,000+ global nodes tailored for artists and creators, dApp developers, and more.\nThen, follow EMURGO on X for more about decentralized storage solutions and other Web3-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "5 Ways NFTs Can Solve Problems in Pro Sports EMURGO?",
    "completion": "August 1, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) have been showing potential synergy with the world of professional sports for some time. These days, sports is viewed as an industry with a progressive stance towards embracing new technologies for the betterment of athletes and fans. With businesses and users moving towards the usage of digital technologies, this synergy seems like a natural progression.\nPro sports is considered one of the biggest attended and viewed events in the world, consistently attracting a high number of fans in person and viewers on various digital media platforms. Media rights deals for popular pro sports are breaking previous records, demonstrating the increasing demand by fans and companies who want to tap into the business of sports.\nIn the blockchain world, there have already been some major collaborations between the sporting world and blockchain technology companies or projects. Yet, the trend is still early, and many in sports are still discovering the potential benefits blockchain-based technologies such as NFTs can offer to sports teams, athletes, and related businesses.\nThis blog will discuss 5 ways NFTs can help solve some common problems in pro sports.\nThere is a market for sports items and moments that come from iconic players, matches, moments, and more. Oftentimes, these can be destroyed by the passing of time and an increasing number of scammers looking to profit. Essentially, an interested buyer would have to trust that the seller or a licensed third party is selling an authentic sports memorabilia product.\nThis is where a blockchain and NFTs provide a powerful use case for product authenticity. NFTs representing these pieces of memorabilia can be issued using blockchain technology and create permanent and immutable records including ownership history, source of origin, and other essential information.\nThese records can be looked up by anyone and no party can manipulate any records. Furthermore, the NFTs can be traded easily between buyers and sellers on a global scale in real-time through the usage of digital token wallets. These NFTs also can never be destroyed or faked, creating a permanent and trusted market for those interested in sports memorabilia.\nRead more: Explaining the technology behind NFTs\nPro sports are a huge, growing business and a global phenomenon. There are passionate fans and supporters of particular sports, teams, and clubs on every continent. This means these sports brands need to continue to appeal to their global audience to grow their fan base and increase revenue over the long term.\nNFTs can play a major tool in this effort.\nMany pro sports entities and athletes are business brands looking to engage with younger fans, most of whom tend to be more tech-inclined and rather open to using emerging technologies.\nAn NFT can be minted by the entity or athlete and distributed to their fans all over the world with equal participation opportunities. The result is a new way to bring these brands closer to their fans. It can also reduce overhead costs for marketing and other business promotional efforts as NFT minting and distribution can be done efficiently and instantly through the Internet.\nFor the fans, they can receive a limited digital token or NFT that demonstrates their passion for a sports team, league, or athlete, that they can choose to keep or trade.\nThe NFT could also be redeemed for an actual physical item from the NFT issuer. It could also be used to access other fan engagement activities that put fans one step closer to a more enriching experience.\nAnother effect of the business of pro sports becoming global is that sports leagues, teams, and athletes need to create global promotions that can effectively reach their fans in different locations.\nSuch marketing campaigns can enable fans to have a sense of equal opportunity to participate in fan activities and have the same chances to win prizes.\nRelated reading:\nNFTs provide a solution to this need. Fans wouldn t have to worry about physically waiting in line or in a digital queue to participate. Any fan with an Internet connection could engage with their favorite team or athlete on a global scale. Sports teams and athletes could come up with ways for their global fans in different countries to use these NFTs for special prizes and activities.\nTeams and brands selling to their global fan base sometimes have difficulties monetizing the gains. For global payments, there are many financial intermediaries, currency conversions, and other related friction points.\nAn NFT sold via a blockchain can eliminate many of these difficulties. Since there is a direct link between the sale of the NFT and the payment, the resulting funds or cryptocurrencies would go directly to the wallet of the creator of the NFT collection and streamline the process. Initially, most might be inclined to use traditional currencies for payment but as awareness grows, sports entities and athletes could integrate certain cryptocurrencies and tokens as payment options.\nTeams and athletes could come up with limited collections of creative NFTs representing various things and market them to their fans as a form of digital merchandise. As mentioned, these NFTs could also be redeemed for various team or athlete-related promotional activities designed to enhance the fan experience.\nSales of pro sports goods on secondary markets don t usually benefit the original brand. There is no concept of royalties when it comes to auctions or sales via private collections. The teams are the originators of the items but do not necessarily benefit from them.\nAn NFT can have a percentage of royalties that go back to the creator from every resale. Teams that embrace NFTs can have a constant source of revenue that comes from the secondary market thanks to this feature.\nThe brands connected to sports are also able to get the same advantage. This can make a new type of market for sports goods that always benefit the teams during their entire lifespan being sold on secondary markets.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily mint NFTs without having to code by providing simple-to-use tools.\nHaving already partnered with Tiamonds to issue and sell NFTs of physical diamonds and Book.io to tokenize e-books, NMKR has demonstrated successful use cases for NFTs using its platform.\nSporting organizations and athletes can also utilize the platform to mint NFTs to receive some of the benefits listed above.\nRead more: How NMKR drives business growth leveraging NFTs\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to receive weekly updates and blog content on Cardano, NFTs, DeFi, blockchain education courses, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "8 Things You Can Do with Yoroi Wallet?",
    "completion": "October 27, 2022\nAlbert Kim\nDeveloped by EMURGO, one of the founding entities of Cardano, Yoroi Wallet launched in August 2018 as the first Cardano blockchain light wallet for ADA cryptocurrency users.\nAs a light wallet, Yoroi enables ADA holders to quickly store, send, receive, and stake ADA without having to download an entire copy of the Cardano blockchain. ADA users can also use Yoroi Wallet to register to vote for Project Catalyst a decentralized funding and governance platform driven by ADA holders on Cardano.\nYoroi is also open-source so it s being maintained in a transparent way for the Cardano community.\nYoroi currently has versions available for both mobile (Android/iOS) and desktop (Chrome/Firefox/Edge) and is also compatible with hardware wallets Ledger and Trezor.\nIn this blog, we will list 8 things you can do with Yoroi Wallet.\nEven with all these features, there will be even more to come in the pipeline.\nYoroi connects to both Ledger and Trezor crypto hardware wallets on the Cardano blockchain.\nConnecting Yoroi to a hardware wallet adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind.\nYour Cardano ADA is securely stored in the hardware wallet, while Yoroi is used as the gateway to interact with dApps, and transactions using ADA.\nCardano is one of the largest proof-of-stake blockchains by market capitalization and an eco-friendly open-source blockchain.\nAs a proof-of-stake blockchain, staking your ADA cryptocurrency is the cornerstone of the security in the Cardano blockchain, and users are rewarded with ADA as an incentive.\nStaking on Cardano is liquid by default meaning that users always have complete control to stake and un-stake their ADA as long as they are using a self-custodial or non-custodial wallet such as Yoroi.\nThis is a key differentiating feature from other proof-of-stake (POS) blockchains that require users to lock their cryptocurrencies or tokens without the ability to freely withdraw them at any given time.\nIt s the way Cardano stake pool operators (SPOs) and delegators collaborate to create a decentralized and secure network for decentralized applications (dApps) running on Cardano.\nCurrently, there are more than 3.9 million active ADA wallet addresses and more than 3,200 Cardano SPOs with nearly 73 of all ADA in circulation being staked to secure the Cardano blockchain.\nSince the beginning, Yoroi was designed to allow ADA users to directly stake from the wallet interface. The Cardano blockchain and Yoroi Wallet are unique in that they offer liquid, self-custodial staking whereby users can stake and un-stake ADA at their discretion.\nOn the Yoroi dashboard, users can see their current delegated and staked ADA, and accumulated rewards. From the Delegation List, a user can search for a particular stake pool to delegate and stake, or see the statistics of all the pools to choose one to delegate and stake.\nAdditionally, from the Dashboard, you can also tap the eye icon next to the balance, to make it visible or hidden.\nFrom Yoroi, transferring crypto is fast. Yoroi users can send ADA and any native token of the Cardano network to another wallet.\nAdditionally, all of the tokens in that wallet can be sent to a different address in a single transaction by selecting All ADA + Tokens from the Amount Options box.\nFrom Yoroi, a user can also receive ADA or any Cardano native token from anywhere in the world with just a few taps.\nYoroi automatically creates many addresses using the verification key and the staking key.\nThe amount of addresses created is virtually infinite, increasing the anonymity of a user s wallet.\nFrom the menu on the left, a user can check which addresses have never been used.\nFind all the addresses that have been used at least once and check which addresses have at least one UTXO.\nIn the Transactions tab, users can review all of their transactions including ADA, native tokens, and NFTs.\nThe transaction history list is ordered chronologically, and the information there can be used to double-check with any blockchain explorer supporting Cardano.\nYoroi is also able to support Cardano native tokens.\nThese assets are listed on the Assets tab.\nA user can easily see the balance, transaction history, and metadata of each asset.\nFrom the Yoroi interface, users can create transactions to move these native tokens individually to other addresses on Cardano.\nAnother amazing feature of Yoroi is the ability to participate in Cardano s Project Catalyst, a decentralized innovation fund for projects building on Cardano.\nProject Catalyst has funded more than 1,000 projects on Cardano to date.\nUsing Yoroi, a user can register to vote during each fund round with a few simple clicks.\nThe wallet will track your ADA balance and transform it into voting power.\nAdditionally, from the Reward tab in the Receive menu, a user can find their staking key.\nThis can be used to track any rewards given for voting on Project Catalyst.\nThe Yoroi dApp connector is the bridge between smart contracts and users on Cardano.\nYou can use Yoroi s dApp connector feature to track and manage Cardano dApps that are connected to your Yoroi Wallet address.\nBy pressing the trashcan icon, users can sever any connection between the wallet and a Cardano dApp.\nYoroi is an open-source wallet for Cardano ADA holders, built to be your gateway to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of dApps including DeFi and NFTs.\nAs a self-custodial wallet, the user is in complete control over their Cardano ADA at all times.\nEMURGO nor any third party can recover your Yoroi Wallet for you. Only ones with access to the correct recovery phrase can recover the wallet. If the recovery phrase is lost, there s no way to recover it.\nFollow Yoroi Wallet on Twitter to receive the latest news and updates.\nIf you need further assistance, contact Yoroi s customer help desk here and a customer support specialist shall respond within 24 hours.\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - October 10, 2024\nKnowledge - October 8, 2024\nKnowledge - October 3, 2024\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

    "prompt": "NFT Insights Tokenization of Tangible Intangible Assets EMURGO?",
    "completion": "June 6, 2024\nEMURGO\nThis weekly blog series provides insights into various NFT use cases including real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and other related educational content.\nNFTs or non-fungible tokens, are starting to expand beyond their initial use cases for art and media distribution and into new exciting use cases.\nAs discussed in previous blogs, one of the biggest potential use cases for NFTs and their underlying blockchain technology is asset tokenization which includes many different kinds of asset types.\nLargely, these asset types such as stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and more are broken down into tangible (physical and measurable assets that can depreciate in value) or intangible (non-physical assets).\nWith blockchain technologies fast evolving and new applications emerging by being built on top of these technologies, NFT applications are also naturally evolving right alongside to have broader appeal.\nAs this new growth phase in the blockchain industry continues, new use cases for NFTs are beginning to emerge and show adoption potential.\nLet s discuss some of these these below.\nAccording to the World Intellectual Property Organization, intellectual property (IP) is defined as creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.\nIP is internationally protected by the laws in most countries through patents, copyrights, and trademarks, enabling creators and innovators to earn recognition and rewards for their work.\nOne of the potential drawbacks of the current system of managing IPs is that some databases are kept domestically without any cross-border coordination.\nThese databases sometimes lack connections with ones beyond their borders, creating uncertainty, especially for Internet-based companies.\nSometimes this is referred to as patent thickets, the result of overlapping intellectual property rights that occur in fragmented markets. The legal challenges for two entities claiming the same patent can be lengthy and result in delays when deploying technology as innovators file their claims.\nIt is becoming more common to read headlines about IP being at the center of conflicting claims between parties. In the digital realm, for example, content creators have conflicts with each other and also with content hosting platforms about IP.\nNFTs have the potential to solve these problems by creating IP claims and having a blockchain transparently record them. NFTs also have the potential to record essential information within the token itself in its metadata which can reduce conflicts over the origin of the IP.\nThese records would be immutable and hard to censor as they are verified and kept on a decentralized blockchain, accessible to all parties.\nRelated reading:\nThus, a decentralized blockchain ledger could be used as the record of truth to see which party owns what.\nThese NFTs could also be used to automate payments for IP holders. For instance, a song used in a video could be purchased for use directly by a content creator from a secondary music marketplace managed using smart contracts.\nAnother use of NFTs is to tie them to a physical, tangible object in continuous demand. The aim is to preserve the unique properties of the object in the metadata of the asset for when it goes to the secondary market.\nThis is especially useful for collector items with a robust resale market and tends to exchange hands frequently before use.\nPremium spirits are one such example, where many buy a bottle of a certain type to resell it later. Validating such an object is difficult, leading to many counterfeits for these items.\nSome premium spirit companies host an NFT promotion where each bottle contains a QR code tied to the NFT. These, in turn, provide proof of ownership for each bottle.\nOther collector items including sports cards, shoes, and more lend themselves as potential NFT use cases where brands can tap into a new young consumer demographic interested in and willing to utilize emerging technologies.\nThrough NFTs and digital asset wallets, brands and creators can start to develop new business models, unlock more creativity, and enhance the liquidity and transparency of their assets.\nMany tangible assets in the world have a lot of value but lack liquidity.\nThis is because transferring ownership of these assets is overly complicated, creating a small market for them. This can result in cases where a tangible asset can have a valuation of millions of dollars, but relatively few ways for the asset owner to sell it for that amount.\nNFTs are now potentially able to create markets for these assets with relatively low liquidity. This is done by creating fractional ownership, which takes an asset that is difficult to divide, creates an NFT of it, and locks it up in a smart contract. The contract can create fractions of the NFT which can be sold and traded.\nAn example is the fractionalized Volkswagen, which is a smaller piece of a Volkswagen car portrait that is an NFT itself.\nAnother example of NFT fractionalization is in real estate.\nMany properties around the world have locked liquidity. This means that even though there is value to be tapped in them, it is very difficult due to the total price of the location. Only a few people can purchase a major ticket item due to reasons such as financing, location of the asset, liquidity, etc.\nHere, NFT fractionalization is a potential solution to enable more liquidity by bringing in more potential buyers for a tokenized asset.\nAnother potential use case that opens up with NFTs and asset tokenization is usage as collateral.\nIn many cases, an asset owner wants to access the liquidity of an asset, but not relinquish control over that item. They may need funds for a temporary trade, purchase other things, or as part of an arbitrage strategy.\nTokenized versions of these assets could in theory have access to a whole DeFi (decentralized finance) market via NFTs and collateralized loans. In this version, an asset owner could request a loan and lock the NFT of the asset as a guarantee. Once the loan is repaid, the NFT is given back to the owner without any intermediary slowing the process down.\nMuch more clarity, frameworks, and products and services would have to be adopted for this to gain more traction.\nFor example, physical diamonds have been successfully tokenized as NFTs, demonstrated by Tiamonds and its partnership with NFT service NMKR. These NFTs are backed by real diamonds and can be redeemed for the physical item at any time. They have intrinsic value and could potentially be used as secure collateral in the future if clarity is given.\nNMKR enables businesses and individuals to tokenize assets in the form of Cardano blockchain NFTs.\nTo date, NMKR has already demonstrated a real use case for asset tokenization through its partnership with Tiamonds to tokenize and sell NFTs of physical diamonds issued and sold in a 1:1 ratio with each actual diamond.\nRead more: A case study into the tokenization of diamonds through NMKR\nNMKR has also tokenized e-books with Book.io to create true digital book ownership. When people buy an eBook or Audiobook, they do not technically own it. Readers are only allowed to read or view without the ability to resell them on secondary marketplaces. The tokenization of such books using NMKR s tokenization technology now empowers ebook readers to own and transact their e-books.\nEMURGO is a global blockchain technology company that provides a variety of Web3 products & services including technical infrastructure development, blockchain education, investment, and media.\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for more content and updates on use cases for blockchain including NFTs and asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "DeFi and Regulations EMURGO?",
    "completion": "January 9, 2024\nEMURGO\nDeFi (decentralized finance) started to gain adoption and users in 2020, experiencing a 20x fold increase in TVL (total value locked) within the DeFi ecosystem. Since then, a lot of new DeFi applications have been built and launched, enabling users all over the world to leverage their crypto assets for a variety of decentralized financial services including lending, borrowing, staking for yield, and more. With this explosive growth in DeFi and crypto overall, regulations have also started to gain more discussion to create a framework for regulators on how to best approach the ongoing development of DeFi.\nAs DeFi is still in a state of regulatory discussion and its applications are designed to be peer-to-peer services leveraging decentralized blockchain technology, users are left vulnerable to security risks, hacks, and other flaws that can let hackers exploit the code of a DeFi application. While DeFi has been on a consistent trajectory of development and adoption, its nascency and risks mentioned above have led to creating an atmosphere of uncertainty to prevent many crypto users from fully engaging with DeFi applications.\nThe current state of DeFi is one of rising awareness and discussion among traditional financial institutions and government regulators. Many are coming to understand DeFi s potential benefits and risks and are thinking of ways to embrace a healthy legislative balance between innovation and regulation.\nHowever, developers and users continue to build new DeFi products and services and upgrade existing ones and increased awareness brings new users into the DeFi ecosystem.\nThe question now is Where does DeFi go from here?\nMost would agree that there is a clear need to either create or modify existing regulations to accommodate the innovative features and growth of DeFi while protecting users.\nLet s take a look at the basic building blocks of DeFi and the current state of DeFi regulations to answer this question.\nAll ecosystems require some sort of basic blocks that can be used for more complex use cases. DeFi is no different, let s describe them:\nCryptocurrency or digital coin: A digital asset that operates independently of any other platform. It is the main or underlying native asset of a blockchain network and it s used to pay for transaction fees. They are the backbone of a certain blockchain and the engine of an ecosystem. Examples of coins include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA).\nToken: A type of cryptocurrency built on top of another blockchain. It does not have its native blockchain network. Often they are created to serve as a utility asset for a platform or project built on top of a blockchain like those mentioned above. Tokens can be fungible and interchangeable or non-fungible and unique which can serve as NFTs.\nOracle: A third-party service that provides blockchain-based smart contracts with external data. This can range from digital asset price feeds for cryptocurrencies and NFTs to real-world price feeds for commodities and interest rates. These data streams are often crucial for more complex DeFi platforms like lending marketplaces, making oracles a critical part of the DeFi world to provide up-to-date and accurate relevant information for users.\nSmart Contract: An arbitrary logic that is executed on top of a decentralized blockchain. Arbitrary means that any type of logic can be run on top of a blockchain. In most cases, it s the business logic that governs the revenue sources for a project or decentralized application (dApp). Smart contracts can be programmed to contain certain conditions that enable the contract to self-execute for its participants once the conditions have been met.\nThe world of DeFi remains in an opaque state. Due to political reasons and/or a lack of general awareness, many of the main regulatory bodies across the world have yet to give a clear framework for this new economic model. This has, in turn, created a space filled with uncertainty for companies, users, and developers, as regulatory agencies can act as final arbitrators by taking legal action on a case-by-case basis.\nLet s look at a few of the major crypto markets in the world to see their current stance on DeFi.\nThe U.S. remains in a deadlock regarding a regulatory framework for blockchain at large and DeFi specifically. Major legislative efforts and talks to discuss frameworks have fallen short and regulators have taken a regulation by enforcement approach. The result has been enormous uncertainty.\nThere has been considerable debate between differing members of the legislature about creating guidelines, but a lack of consensus and interest has stalled the advancement of these discussions.\nCongress had also proposed imposing identity verification measures for DeFi applications.\nThe E.U. is ahead with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) draft legislation. It aims to create an all-encompassing legal framework for the regulation of crypto assets in the E.U. The objective of MiCA is to take some of the lessons learned so far and establish definitions and best practices for the industry.\nThe main tasks for the MiCA framework are:\nThe effort is well underway and it has been approved at the level of the E.U. government bodies. The initial portions of MiCA are expected to take effect by June 2024, and all of the provisions by the end of the same year.\nOne aspect of MiCA that is very controversial is the banning of all algorithmic stablecoins and only allowing fiat-backed stablecoins. The latter also have to do regular audits and prove they have a 1-to-1 reserve ratio for all tokens in circulation.\nIn Asia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore are the countries typically mentioned at the forefront of crypto regulation. These countries have been taking a more active approach towards creating regulatory frameworks for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) and clarity through guidelines and a more supportive stance.\nEach is striving to become a leader for Web3 in general while specific guidelines for DeFi-related properties such as stablecoins are usually more commonplace. In Japan, Circle partnered with Japanese securities company SBI Holdings to seek the distribution of its USDC stablecoin while Hong Kong and Singapore have been granting license approvals for various VASPs to run their businesses in each region.\nIn addition to granting licenses, and tax guidelines, discussions on DAOs, ETFs and more have been on the agenda.\nIn contrast with the US, Asia has taken measures to embrace Web3 which in turn might also lead to more clarity and guidelines for DeFi.\nIn the three examples above, we see the current approaches to DeFi have different realities. While Web3 and crypto as a whole might be supported, we have yet to see clearer definitive guidelines for DeFi other than those related to stablecoins.\nIt remains an open question as to what will be the effects of these ongoing guidelines, but clearer regulations also mean some DeFi products or features might not be allowed in certain jurisdictions.\nOnly time will tell if the MiCA and Asian frameworks help or hamper DeFi. While it should theoretically onboard more users to crypto as a whole, the implications for DeFi are unknown.\nAt the very least, a couple of major regions are tackling the challenge of regulating the blockchain and embracing the advent of blockchain technology to transform industries and create economic growth. This embrace and support should lead to more discussions and guidelines for specific sectors of blockchain and crypto such as DeFi as well.\nRead more: 5 most promising use cases for DeFi\nClick here to sign up\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are hosting a 2-day workshop on DeFi for business and finance professionals in Singapore in January 2024 with speakers from EMURGO, EMURGO Academy, Coinbase Singapore, Merkle Science, and more.\nThis DeFi workshop will provide a comprehensive overview of DeFi, enabling attendees to make informed decisions, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of DeFi.\nFor more workshop information including dates and registration info, please visit the official registration page here.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "Cardano 101 Selfcustodial Staking and Why it is Important?",
    "completion": "February 10, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nFor instance, there is a self-custodial crypto wallet in which the user retains full control over their cryptocurrencies and their private key at all times.\nThere is also a custodial or third-party custodial wallet in which a third party retains control and manages the cryptocurrencies on the user s behalf. This requires that the user places their trust in the third party to manage the cryptocurrencies in good faith. A cryptocurrency exchange wallet is a good example of this type of non-custodial wallet.\nThis interest in self-custody has extended to not only crypto wallets but all aspects of decentralized blockchain technology.\nCompared to other proof-of-stake blockchains, Cardano possesses unique technical design features that enable simple self-custody of Cardano ADA and Cardano native tokens even while staking to earn rewards.\nCardano ADA holders can always retain full control over their stake and withdraw their stake at any time if they use a self-custodial wallet.\nThe Cardano blockchain uses a unique staking mechanism based on Game Theory rather than slashing.\nThe complete outline of how it works can be found in the Ouroboros whitepaper, but it s been proven to work and tested on various conditions. Ouroboros is the name of the proof-of-stake protocol that secures Cardano s decentralized blockchain.\nThe implications of Cardano s design choice are:\nThe custody of the ADA cryptocurrency delegated to a Cardano stake pool is always under the control of the private key of the owner. For this reason, delegation for Cardano ADA staking purposes poses no loss of ownership risk to the owner of the ADA.\nCardano ADA holders can easily download and use self-custodial wallets such as Yoroi to stake ADA directly from their wallet on both mobile and desktop browser versions while retaining full control over their ADA.\nMore: How to stake Cardano ADA using Yoroi Wallet\nThis low-risk approach has created a funding mechanism unique to the Cardano blockchain, the Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO).\nIn an ISPO, ADA holders delegate to a Cardano staking pool from a specific project building on Cardano, the project keeps a varying percentage of the staking rewards to fund its project development, and the delegators receive the project s token.\nThe delegators know that their ADA can never be taken, and they accept the risk of losing their ADA rewards in exchange for the project s tokens.\nThis can help fund in part new Cardano projects, plus it attracts a lot of new users to projects that engage in an ISPO.\nAnother feature of self-custodial staking is hardware wallet delegation.\nAll major wallet manufacturers in the blockchain industry support hardware wallet delegation for Cardano ADA.\nThis means users can hold ADA in their hardware device, and still get the benefits and rewards from delegation and staking.\nThis increases security as the private key of a hardware wallet is offline and the user further protects the cryptocurrencies in their wallet. The Cardano blockchain network still calculates the rewards based on the amount of ADA delegated from the wallet.\nMore: How to connect Yoroi to Ledger Wallet\nOnce the rewards have accumulated, the owner can withdraw them and send them directly to the hardware wallet. The added layer of security ensures the ADA is protected from potential attackers, and the user doesn t need to sacrifice the staking rewards of the Cardano blockchain network.\nThis careful approach to Proof-of-Stake has resulted in a much more robust and secure consensus mechanism for the Cardano blockchain. At the same time, the design choices have also made it a better user experience for ADA users looking to accumulate rewards while securing the Cardano blockchain network.\nYoroi is an open-source and the first crypto light wallet for Cardano ADA holders. It allows Cardano ADA holders to store, send, receive, and stake Cardano ADA for rewards and to secure Cardano s decentralized blockchain.\nAvailable for mobile and desktop browsers, Yoroi is designed to be your gateway to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of dApps including Cardano DeFi, Cardano NFTs, and the USDA stablecoin.\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - October 8, 2024\nKnowledge - October 3, 2024\nKnowledge - October 1, 2024\nGet the latest updates\n2024 EMURGO.

    "prompt": "A History of Stablecoins on Cardano?",
    "completion": "November 14, 2022\nEMURGO\nKeep in mind that these topics only provide educational information and are in no way financial advice.\n*Updated November 24. Ardana has stopped working on the project.\nStablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of a fiat currency like the US dollar, is an integral part of any blockchain ecosystem.\nThey are one of the main building blocks allowing new and existing cryptocurrency users to engage in cross-border remittances, digital payments, cryptocurrency trading, NFT transactions, and a lot more.\nAs of today, there are no live stablecoins on the Cardano blockchain network, but native Cardano stablecoins are under development.\nDespite this, there is a robust history of research on Cardano stablecoins that has led to innovative designs to launch the next generation of stable cryptocurrencies on Cardano, especially with smart contracts and Cardano native assets functionality already having been integrated into the Cardano blockchain.\nCombined with the 3.9 million+ active ADA wallet addresses around the world and one of the largest blockchain networks in the industry by market capitalization, Cardano is primed for native stablecoin types to take the next leap in onboarding users to gain accessible financial services.\nIn this blog, we will look at the short history and current status of stablecoin development on Cardano.\nAn algorithmic stablecoin aims to provide price stability and balance its circulating supply by being pegged to a reserve or backing asset non-tangible to the real world.\nAn algorithm is in charge of issuing more stablecoins when its backed asset increases above 1 US dollar and buying them off the market when the price falls below 1 US dollar. The inner workings of this system are coded in a smart contract.\nThe Djed stablecoin is minted by users sending Cardano s native cryptocurrency ADA to a smart contract, then the contract will send an equivalent amount of Djed back to the user. As the price of Djed hovers around $1, the smart contract behind Djed is in charge of balancing the supply in circulation to maintain the price stability of Djed around $1.\nHowever, there have been problems in the past with algorithmic stablecoins backed by a single cryptocurrency.\nTo address these shortcomings, Djed has a reserve asset called the Shen token.\nThe role of the Shen token is to help ensure price stability by guaranteeing the collateralization rate and the price peg of the stablecoin.\nOn Cardano, the Djed stablecoin has been working on a testnet for a few months.\nThe COTI project also received funding from the cFund, IOG s innovation fund.\n*Updated November 24. Ardana has stopped working on the project.\nArdana is another project launching a stablecoin on Cardano.\nThe team received funding from the cFund, IOG s innovation fund.\nArdana is looking to create a stablecoin, the Ardana dollar (dUSD), backed by crypto tokens locked in the protocol used as collateral.\ndUSD is minted by depositing collateral assets into vaults within Ardana s protocol using unique smart contracts known as Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs).\nThe collateral provided is used to create an equivalent amount of dUSD which then enters the market.\nOther users then buy dUSD tokens on exchanges, or simply by receiving them as a means of payment.\nThe dUSD in circulation maintains its stable value by the collateral locked in the vaults.\nIf a vault falls short of the necessary collateral amount, it s liquidated in an auction.\nLiquidators bid against each other to repay the undercollateralized vault s stablecoin debt in exchange for receiving the vault s collateral at a discount.\nA liquidated vault will then be charged a liquidation penalty, which will be taken from the vault s underlying collateral.\nAgeUSD was a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin discussed by the Ergo Foundation, EMURGO, and IOG for the Ergo Blockchain.\nAgeUSD was designed to not use CDPs, as in some of the examples mentioned above. The AgeUSD model has been applied to the Ergo blockchain by the project SigmaUSD.\nIn SigmaUSD, Reserve Providers submit ERGs (the native cryptocurrency of Ergo) to the protocol s reserves, by doing so, they mint ReserveCoins (called SigmaRSV). Each SigmaRSV represents a portion of the underlying ERG reserves held in the dApp s treasury.\nThe SigmaUSD users also submit ERGs as reserves, but when they do so, they mint SigmaUSD instead. This is only allowed by the protocol if there are sufficient reserves within the treasury, meaning each SigmaUSD in circulation has more collateral to support its stable value.\nAt any point in time, a SigmaUSD token can be redeemed in exchange for ERGs from the reserves equal to the current exchange rate as determined by the ERG-USD Oracle Pool. This burns SigmaUSD tokens out of circulation in direct proportion to the ERG coins removed from the reserves.\nIf you know of other projects building stablecoins on Cardano, then please reach out to us at marketing@emurgo.io\nYou can follow EMURGO s official channels listed below for up-to-date information and announcements about EMURGO and Cardano.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nEMURGO Group Pte.

    "prompt": "5 Things to Build With Blockchain Developer Education EMURGO?",
    "completion": "February 15, 2024\nEMURGO\nReceiving quality blockchain education provides the foundational building blocks for interested developers and business professionals to start building and/or working with blockchain-based products and services (other times referred to as Web3 products and services). Blockchain technology, mainly decentralized blockchain technology, can be considered a financial technology and this means that blockchain has unlocked many possibilities for developers and entrepreneurs to launch decentralized products that have an immediate global reach.\nThe key to being able to do this is quality blockchain education.\nMany types of decentralized financial services such as remittances, payments, borrowing, lending, and other services such as authentication, asset tokenization, etc. can be launched on top of a decentralized blockchain network such as Cardano.\nAnyone on the planet with an internet connection is also able to create these things without restrictions. The amount of freedom blockchain technology affords to individuals and groups of developers is unprecedented.\nIn this blog, we ll go over some examples of decentralized products & services or applications that can be built by having a blockchain developer education and which can then become a launchpad for bigger blockchain projects.\nHere are some different blockchain projects to build below.\nNFTs or non-fungible tokens started gaining popularity a few years ago as uniquely verifiable digital representations of assets such as music, art, video, and more, that are issued and recorded on a decentralized blockchain.\nWith a basic blockchain developer education, you can build an NFT drop.\nThis is one of the easiest blockchain projects an entry-level blockchain developer can build and can be completed early in the career of a blockchain developer. It not only helps with developing your developer portfolio but also serves as a career launchpad for more complex projects.\nThe NFT drop consists of creating a collection of NFTs. There are two parts to an NFT:\nFirst, we have the token. This means that the asset is going to be recorded in the decentralized blockchain ledger. An NFT token is a type of asset that has no decimals, it cannot be broken down into smaller chunks, and each token in the supply has a unique ID that separates them from the whole.\nThe main decision to take in at this level is the total supply. In most cases, developers chose to have a round number that can be easily tracked. The average size for an NFT collection is around 10,000 units or tokens.\nSecond, is the artwork and metadata. The images most associated with the NFT are not stored directly on the blockchain. They are saved in either decentralized storage networks (IPFS, Arweave, Sia Tech, etc.) or in traditional databases. Then a unique identifier called a hash of the image is generated and referenced in the metadata of the token. In Cardano, the metadata is stored on the network, with one hash of an image per token in the NFT collection.\nNext, the metadata information is required. Once the hash of the image is completed, the rest needs to be decided. In most cases, there is a reference to the rarity of the attributes in the NFT, such as the date it was created, the name of the collection, and other details. The NFT s metadata can be freely crafted to reflect the uniqueness of a collection.\nOnce all of the pieces are in place, the NFT collection can be sold on any of the marketplaces on the Cardano network. This concludes the life cycle of this type of project.\nRead more: EMURGO Academy explains NFTs and blockchain metadata\nAnother type of small blockchain project that can be completed after completing a blockchain developer education course is building a lending smart contract.\nIts job is to take one cryptocurrency or token and lock it in a smart contract, serving as collateral. Once the collateral asset is provided, the contract releases another crypto asset as a loan for the user.\nThe contract then has to track the time since the loan was taken. The loan has a pre-established interest rate that is computed along with the time and the loan amount to give the user how much it s needed to pay back.\nOnce the user pays back the loan amount plus the accumulated interest, the original collateral is released back to the user s wallet. If not, the remaining debt is liquidated and the collateral is given as a reward to whoever pays the loan.\nThis type of logic is one of the basic building blocks of DeFi (decentralized finance). The project touches on many of the most used smart contract primitives such as time-locked logic, time tracking, and interest rate management. It can be the perfect launchpad for a DeFi platform.\nRead more: How to start using DeFi\nThe yield smart contract is a DeFi platform where users lock their assets in a smart contract which in turn gives them a percentage gain based on the amount deposited. It is a mid-level product that can make blockchain developers familiar with smart contract design, wallet integration, front-end layout for a DeFi product, and user security.\nIt also couples perfectly with the collateral lending smart contract as it can give rewards to those users who provided liquidity for the loans. By doing this, it can give a higher yield to those participating in the lending marketplace and incentivize more participation.\nThis can quickly be the basis of a small DeFi platform that can bridge bigger DeFi projects with a team of developers. It s a great way to learn about DeFi and also start creating a bigger DeFi platform with more use cases.\nRead more: 5 promising real use cases for DeFi\nAnother mid-level project is a voting system using smart contracts. Many crypto projects use DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) tools to operate, of which the most basic type of tool is voting. It uses a token to represent the voting rights of each member of the organization. The platform creates a poll and users choose from the alternatives with their tokens as the basis for voting.\nThis type of platform needs wallet integration and also the ability to read the balance of a particular token from the wallet. Only one asset can be used as a voting right, so the platform should only consider that one asset.\nThis need to query token balance from a wallet address directly from the blockchain makes this project a little more difficult than the previous ones. It s a great stepping stone to more complex decentralized applications, in particular those that have to retrieve information from the blockchain in real time.\nA project with much more complexity is a decentralized NFT marketplace. This means that the sale and purchase of the tokens should be managed by smart contracts and not by custodial systems. This type of platform requires several smart contracts working together to achieve the goal.\nIt s also one where the team needs to decide on several settings for the platform such as the fee charged by the marketplace if it allows for royalties on resales, minting of NFTs by users, and many other platform configurations.\nIt s an advanced-level project and one that it s almost impossible to complete alone. In most cases, a group of developers need to band together and take on portions of the platform to finish in a relatively short time. Yet, it s a project that once completed showcases the knowledge of a developer team.\nAre you new to blockchain and Cardano and want to learn the basics about becoming a blockchain developer?\nEMURGO Academy, the education unit of global blockchain technology company EMURGO, provides comprehensive and tailored blockchain education courses to interested developers and business professionals, with new cohorts consistently starting. These various courses aim to equip students with the tools necessary to build a career in blockchain and are offered online.\nFollow EMURGO on X for more information on Cardano blockchain education courses, workshops, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "5 Reasons Why Business Professionals Should Learn About DeFi EMURGO?",
    "completion": "December 7, 2023\nEMURGO\nThe world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is developing rapidly and traditional financial businesses are becoming aware of the value DeFi products & services can deliver to users.\nIn fact, since 2019, it s become one of the main driving forces behind blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption. Through self-executing and programmable smart contracts on large decentralized blockchains like Cardano and Ethereum, developers have built self-running software protocols that offer services such as borrowing, lending, and more without a centralized party. These protocols are part of the blockchain-based DeFi ecosystem that has grown immensely over the past few years due to its decentralized nature which offers faster settlement, permissionless access, lower fees in many cases, and a global reach.\nDue to its nascency and lack of awareness, DeFi also has a reputation for being risky. However, more people and organizations are starting to learn about DeFi and its potential implications for the future of finance, especially as the world accelerates toward Web3 which uses blockchain-based products & services and digital transformation.\nIn this blog, we ll delve into the basics of DeFi and show why it s a valuable skill to learn for business professionals and those in traditional enterprises.\nCentralized finance (CeFi) is what those from the DeFi world have dubbed the traditional financial industry. It s a term that aims to denote the main characteristics of both fields. On the one hand, the traditional financial industry offers financial services that are characterized as being permissioned or requiring approval from a centralized financial institution or authority.\nIn the DeFi world, most of these services are permissionless and accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\nThe main factor that separates both worlds is the maintenance of the transaction database or ledger. In CeFi, ledgers are controlled and changed by those institutions in charge of the transactions. The ledger is part of the informatic systems of the institutions and its integrity is ensured by a combination of computer science and traditional regulations.\nIn DeFi, by contrast, ledgers are maintained by a network of computers that are forced by an algorithmic consensus mechanism to reach a global agreement on the transactions on a ledger. This maintains the integrity of the history of transactions without the intervention of authorities or external regulations. In other words, open-source algorithms help the DeFi applications run autonomously and also provide transparency to its users.\nThis is the crucial difference that allows decentralized blockchains to work and never process an incorrect transaction. Also, the smart contracts in a DeFi application allow custom logic to be executed on top of this ledger which gives outcomes that can be verified by everyone transparently.\nIn many developed, emerging, and developing countries, many people still lack access to basic financial services such as savings, and borrowing, and also lack complete control over their funds due to a myriad of factors. Financial institutions can deny such services and hold the centralized authority to make such decisions including enabling their customers to access their funds freely. In DeFi, people have more control over their funds and can access various services as they wish.\nSo, why is learning DeFi valuable? What implications does DeFi have for the future of finance?\nHere are 5 reasons why businesses and professionals should learn about DeFi.\nBlockchains, smart contracts, and DeFi have created a new type of market. One that is fully automated, transactions and outcomes can be defined in code logic and then these can be executed automatically when the conditions are met.\nThe way money can be programmed in DeFi is beyond the capacity of similar systems that are used in traditional finance. In that world, the logic is outside the money system itself, while in DeFi programmability is part of the network from the ground up.\nThe DeFi world never stops, in the most true sense, it is a global and free market. It operates in all parts of the world without any regulatory barriers, it s open 24/7 and it has a constant stream of volume. The DeFi ecosystem is global in a way no other market has ever been.\nAny professional who wants to trade and find opportunities in an almost endless market must know DeFi. The opportunities in this type of environment are far more frequent and bigger than in traditional markets. Especially for those not living close to major financial centers.\nAutomated market makers (AMMs), synthetic assets, liquidity pools, flash loans, and much more are some of the innovations that have already happened in DeFi. The ecosystem is filled with new projects that launch weekly, each trying to add some new functionality previously thought impossible with millions of users and large transaction volume.\nIt is DeFi where the frontier of financial services is located. The next big changes will happen in DeFi and not in the major banks. For those who want to be at the edge of the next wave of changes in the financial industry.\nLedgers in traditional financial institutions are black boxes. Only regulators, lawyers, or accountants working for the institution ever see the complete picture of those transactions. This means that the outsiders are at the mercy of those facts that are disclosed by law or on other particular occasions.\nThe DeFi world is completely the opposite. Anyone can audit a trail of transactions or look for opportunities in the on-chain data. The ledger is 100 visible and transparent, it is both a major boost to security and democratizing information.\nFor those who use the blockchain network, assets are at all times in their possession. There are no intermediaries, and that means no custodial third parties that can remove or take control of an asset not owned by them.\nTransfer and ownership are also simultaneous. In traditional finance, in most cases when an asset is transferred the ownership of said asset is not complete until the books are settled. That can be several days or weeks after the transaction. In DeFi both things happen at the same time as a transaction is settled by the ledger at the moment it happens.\nThose are the advantages DeFi offers for those wanting to learn about the new frontier of finance. It s a new type of market, one that cannot be replicated by any other type of technology and one that will become the standard for the future.\nClick here to sign up\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are teaming up to offer a special 2-day workshop on DeFi to businesses and professionals in Singapore.\nThis 2-day DeFi workshop aims to provide a well-rounded understanding of both blockchain and DeFi (decentralized finance), enabling attendees to make informed decisions, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of this innovative financial space.

    "prompt": "NFT Insights Tokenization of Physical Collectibles EMURGO?",
    "completion": "April 10, 2024\nEMURGO\nThere is an enormous market for luxury collectibles which is expanding. It s estimated the global collectibles market is worth $372 billion and is poised to reach $522 billion by 2028. This has created an increasing demand for these assets by many collectors.\nIn some cases, collectors don t buy these items because they are interested in the specific object. Rather, they purchase them expecting a return in the future.\nHowever, this can be a complicated proposition, as the market for these luxury goods tends to be restricted to certain geographical markets and significantly reliant on private, personal transactions. This results in sellers facing potential difficulties in finding interested buyers close to where they are located and buyers unable to find sellers.\nThis presents another potential real use case for asset tokenization, where NFTs and blockchain technology can offer a viable solution to buyers and sellers of luxury collectibles.\nLuxury collectibles are a category that covers many types of items like handbags, sneakers, watches, toys, jewelry, and other things. This range of diversity makes it a challenge to represent them under a single asset type.\nNon-fungible tokens or NFTs present a real solution to this challenge. Each item can be represented as an NFT and relevant collectible information can be recorded in the metadata of the NFT. Each record ensures the item is unique or part of a larger collection.\nRelated reading:\nOne example is BearBrick, a series of collectibles. Each BearBrick is part of a collection that has limited units. Some collections are rarer than others, and there are also unique statues that are more expensive.\nThese collectibles have been tokenized from time to time. The company also created an NFT series, although the NFT is just an addition to the collectible, not a claim of ownership over the actual object.\nAnother example of tokenized luxury goods can be found in the sneakers market.\nRecently, Adidas sold a collection of tokenized sneakers and managed to raise $22 million. This is a clear example of a major sporting brand adopting NFT technology and tokenization, which is attracting the attention of other big sporting brands.\nTokenization of physical objects requires an additional layer. This means having a third party hold or custody the items securely while the NFTs are used to trade the ownership of the collectible item.\nOnce a buyer wants to have ownership of the collectible, they can request the custodian to release the item to them. This would burn the NFT and remove it from the blockchain ledger, so it cannot be traded anymore.\nAll of this essential information including transaction history and manufacturer information would be included in the NFT metadata, transparent to potential buyers.\nCurrently, the market for collectibles has many issues. However, blockchain technology can now solve many of these issues. The advantages of tokenized collectibles are unique:\nFraud prevention: forgeries plague the collectibles market. For example, it s estimated that a certain percentage of luxury watches are fake. Tokenization can combat this by recording the characteristics of each item in NFT metadata.\nGeo-locked markets: physical goods are tied to their local markets. A collectible can be valuable, but if there are no buyers near the seller, then the value is immaterial. Tokenization can open up the collectibles markets, by allowing a global pool of buyers for NFTs of collectible assets.\nLow liquidity: collectibles also suffer from low liquidity. This can be overturned by having the global market of the blockchain integrated with the sale of any collectible.\nUntapped potential: collectibles are sometimes used as collateral to borrow money. However, there are cases where a shop takes advantage of the user and gives them a lowball offer amount for the item. In blockchain, NFTs can be used as collateral for loans and can be much fairer and more numerous than traditional methods.\nOne prime example of a real use case for asset tokenization is NMKR, an NFT and tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain.\nIt has demonstrated a use case through its partnership with Tiamonds, which focuses on the tokenization of diamonds using NFTs. These can be traded over the Cardano blockchain while the actual diamond is locked and secured with a third-party custodian.\nAt any point, a holder of one of the Tiamonds NFTs can redeem the token for the actual physical diamond. At this point, the NFT representing that diamond is burned and removed from the supply. NMKR helped Tiamonds tokenize diamonds and sell them over the Cardano network.\nRead more: How NMKR tokenized diamonds with Tiamonds\nThis was a specific instance of tokenization by NMKR, as they worked directly with the other project to craft the NFTs representing the diamonds.\nNMKR plans to expand this model with more tools and features and launch a broader tokenization platform to enable more businesses to create tokens of real-world assets using NFTs.\nInterested in learning more about real-world asset (RWA) tokenization using blockchain technology?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to receive future notifications about blogs and content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "NFT Insights Tokenization of Real Estate EMURGO?",
    "completion": "April 22, 2024\nEMURGO\nReal estate is one of the most common and largest asset classes. To this day, many people consider real estate an investment and a long-term store of value. As a traditional asset class, huge sums of money are stored in real estate with the support of borrowing and lending services from banks and other financial institutions.\nHowever, investing in real estate can also have some drawbacks.\nDepending on the location, asking price, and type of real estate, the asset can be relatively illiquid requiring much effort to match buyers and sellers. Access to financial services to acquire real estate can be limited for potential buyers due to credit history, geographical location, citizenship status, etc.\nThere can also be a lack of transparency and accountability with land registry information, tax history, and other administrative paperwork depending on the country location of the desired real estate. It could be difficult for would-be buyers from different countries to easily buy portions of their preferred real estate due to legal and financial restrictions.\nSome of these drawbacks could be partially or wholly solved by using blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets.\nIn this blog, let s explore how real estate property can be fractionalized using digital tokens, its implications, and the future of real estate transactions in the age of blockchain.\nFractional ownership refers to a collaborative investment strategy where multiple parties own portions of a real estate property, like a residential home, condominium, apartment, or commercial real estate. This modality of ownership offers each investor specific ownership rights and entitlements to the asset based on their contribution.\nIn some cases, proprietors split ownership by using a legal entity, meaning that a separate legal entity owns the actual property.\nRelated reading:\nAnother legal structure for fractional ownership is the Tenancy-in-common (TIC) which provides all the individual tenants with a deed for a fraction or percentage of a commercial or residential property. The TIC allows individuals to own different percentages of the property but share it equally.\nAnother common type of real estate investment method is through a real estate investment trust (REIT). A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool capital investors who earn dividends from real estate investments. Investors do not individually buy, own, manage, or finance the properties. It is a simple way for investors to gain investment portfolio exposure to real estate, yet do not enable them to own the property.\nHowever, when real estate is tokenized and sold through a secondary market, the token holders own the fractionalized portion of the real estate.\nREITs also have other fees that investors must pay, including asset management fees, acquisition costs, and other expenses.\nAs of now, REITs are listed on major stock exchanges, providing liquidity and an opportunity for investors to invest in real estate. Yet, the investors are responsible for paying fees and do not own the properties outright. With more regulatory clarity for real estate tokenization coupled with more technical development of real estate tokenization platforms and solutions using blockchain technology, the market for real estate tokenization can expand quickly in the future.\nThe barrier to making fractionalized ownership a widespread modality is the complicated part. It is difficult to set up, find, and transact properties that offer this option on an instantaneous global scale, especially via the Internet.\nYet, using blockchain technology and NFTs, a piece of real estate can be instantly fractionalized and tokenized, and digitally represented as an NFT. The NFT contains all the necessary information regarding the real estate asset such as address, type of property, value, insurance status, transaction history, ownership, etc. in the token metadata.\nA legal entity can then take possession of the whole NFT as a custodian and issue fractionalized tokens representing a portion of the total value of the NFT. These tokens are then sold to global individual investors who can buy as much of the property as they wish using their digital token wallet which contains the NFT. This would also allow for quick transaction settlement on a global scale with real-time transparency as transactions can be looked up using blockchain explorers.\nIn most cases, these fractionalized NFT tokens would be considered securities. People looking to buy them would have to go through the usual KYC & AML procedures to be able to buy a token share using a regulated marketplace platform for real estate trading. Properties are part of the securities market, and shares of those properties inherit the same regulatory framework.\nThese tokens could be freely issued and distributed using a decentralized blockchain ledger. Each token would appreciate by the same percentage as the whole property. This means an individual investor can control how much exposure they are willing to tolerate per property.\nHere are some advantages to this mode of property ownership:\nEnhanced liquidity: Real estate is a relatively non-liquid asset. It takes time and effort to match buyers and sellers and find rental tenants. The tokenization of property completely changes this reality. Fractionalized NFTs can be freely issued and traded on secondary markets enhancing the liquidity of the entire asset class. This would spur demand for building regulatory frameworks and marketplaces to facilitate the trading of fractionalized real estate NFTs.\nIncreased transparency: Decentralized blockchain technology ensures that all real estate transactions are recorded and accessible to token holders. Transactions can be searched in real time using blockchain explorers. Token metadata would enable anyone to view important relevant information about the real estate asset. The information would be immutable and censorship-resistant. This gives a heightened sense of security and trust between buyers and sellers. In some parts of the world, there is a lack of transparency and accountability within local governments and with property owners which makes it difficult for buyers to trust the asset they wish to purchase.\nAccessibility: Fractionalized tokens lower the investment barrier for all types of investors. Theoretically, anyone with the necessary funds could buy fractions of real estate properties with an internet connection regardless of their residency location and amount of liquid funds available. There would be less of a need to rely on banking services to grant access to mortgages. People in one country could more easily invest in real estate of their choice in another country.\nPortfolio Diversification: Investors could buy fractionalized shares in several different properties. Rather than having to secure a large amount of funds for a single property, they could choose to invest in several fractionalized portions of tokenized properties. This reduces the risk profile of real estate investments and ensures people can create diverse property portfolios according to their risk tolerance.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It plans to add more tokenization functionalities to its NMKR Studio tool, including open-source smart contract tokenization.\nTo date, NMKR s platform has issued more than 2.2 million NFTs with an overall transaction volume surpassing $65 million for more than 30,000 projects.\nNMKR has already demonstrated a successful use case for asset tokenization through its partnership with Tiamonds to tokenize and sell NFTs of physical diamonds. These NFTs are issued and sold in a 1:1 ratio with each physical diamond insured and stored in vaults. This has enabled diamond buyers and investors to purchase diamonds, gain access to verified information about the purchased diamond through token metadata, and be able to redeem the NFT for the actual diamond at any time.\nRead more: A case study into the tokenization of diamonds through NMKR\nNMKR has also helped to tokenize e-books with Book.io to create true digital book ownership. Currently, when people buy an eBook or Audiobook, they do not technically own it. Readers are only allowed to read or view without the ability to resell them on secondary marketplaces. The tokenization of such books using NMKR s tokenization technology now empowers ebook readers to simply own and transact their e-books as desired.\nWant to stay on top of the latest news about real-world asset tokenization using Cardano?\nFollow EMURGO on X to receive these updates.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "prompt": "The 5 Most Promising Real Use Cases for DeFi EMURGO?",
    "completion": "December 12, 2023\nEMURGO\nDeFi (decentralized finance) is now entering an exciting period of development where its real use cases are being more acknowledged, adopted, and scaled for more users after an initial experimentation phase led by early adopters. Now, DeFi is much more well-known in the blockchain community and starting to be discussed in traditional financial circles.\nThe task of identifying these real DeFi use cases can be a daunting one as DeFi has been characterized as being very innovative and fast-paced with several projects having launched on different decentralized blockchain networks.\nIn this blog, we ll go over five of the most promising use cases for DeFi and explain their potential benefits for users.\nAt first, stablecoins (digital tokens backed 1:1 by a fiat currency) may seem to not be part of DeFi, yet they are at the core of the space. It is an asset class that can be used for immediate payments, cross-border remittances, a haven from volatility, a long-term store of value, and more, which holds immense value for individual users, enterprises, and organizations.\nThe stablecoin is also a complex asset. How it maintains its peg to a regularly accepted currency is crucial for its proper functioning. There are three ways to do this:\nEach type of stablecoin has its place in the DeFi ecosystem of a network. All are needed for the growth of DeFi.\nRead more: What s the difference between CeFi and DeFi?\nIn the developing world, they also are playing a pivotal role. In many regions, inflation is causing economic distress, and certain governments are implementing capital controls to prevent citizens from buying US dollars which are deemed to be more stable . In these regions, stablecoins are providing an alternative way for these people to protect themselves from their currency devaluation and engage in economic activity through an internet connection.\nSometimes overlooked, the quick settlement of cross-border transactions is a significant problem worldwide. Networks such as SWIFT are built using outdated technology and are slow and expensive to use. Financial institutions are open to looking for cheaper options that are also more efficient.\nThe decentralized nature of blockchain and its programmable smart contracts are perfect for this type of problem. They can settle transactions between financial institutions or multiple parties across all types of physical borders without any intermediaries. Transactions can be bundled or even programmed to autonomously self-execute if certain conditions are met with complete transparency and accountability.\nUsing DeFi products & services built on top of decentralized blockchain technology, global cross-border payments can be instantaneous with immediate settlement, and lower fees.\nNot everyone has access to global financial markets, which are located in a few centralized locations in the developed world. This can pose a drawback to certain people who are unable to access services based on such traditional financial markets. The blockchain and DeFi have a solution called synthetic assets.\nCommodities, stocks, gold, oil, national currencies, and other traditional assets have the potential to be digitally represented on a decentralized blockchain and can be made to mirror the behavior of the original asset. These synthetic assets can give market access to anyone around the world to markets that would be close to them.\nMany markets can be simulated using cryptocurrencies and made to track the underlying asset. This has created a new type of market where people can get exposure to gold, oil, soybeans, and other types of commodities without having to own the asset itself while benefiting from the unique value proposition of crypto-based DeFi products and services such as fractional ownership, fast settlement, open access, and more.\nAnother type of DeFi product is borrowing and lending marketplaces. Here, loans are permissionless meaning that any person that meets collateral requirements can immediately get a loan and use it for other purposes. Access to such services is decentralized and more accessible than having to go through a centralized financial institution.\nThese lending marketplaces can be used by traders and others looking for yield and those looking for more accessible credit. There is still a way to go to raise awareness and drive more adoption of these services, but the idea is gaining more traction as time passes and developers are consistently working to improve these services.\nThese kinds of marketplaces can hold appeal for those lacking access to basic financial services for various reasons such as poor credit or a lack of credit history, bank account, etc.\nMarkets in the real world are difficult to make global or have them attract liquidity at the very beginning. This is especially so in developing countries, but DeFi is a potential solution with the ability to tokenize assets.\nTokenization means taking the characteristics of a real-world asset and creating a digital representation of it that is recorded on a decentralized blockchain. The difference with synthetic assets is that the underlying asset is not needed in the former, while in the latter, the original asset is incorporated into the ledger.\nThis creates an immediate global market for the tokenized item and also access to liquidity via the blockchain network. Almost anything can be tokenized, including real estate property, intellectual property such as artwork and music, and shares of bonds. Since these are digitally recorded and maintained, ownership and transactions can be fractionalized and traded globally with fast settlement.\nRead more: EMURGO presents in front of Wyoming Stable Token Commission\nClick here to sign up\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are teaming up to offer a special 2-day workshop on DeFi to businesses and professionals in Singapore.\nThis 2-day DeFi workshop aims to provide a well-rounded understanding of both blockchain and DeFi (decentralized finance), enabling attendees to make informed decisions, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of this innovative financial space.

    "prompt": "How to Start Getting Involved With DeFi EMURGO?",
    "completion": "January 5, 2024\nEMURGO\nDeFi (decentralized finance), which leverages decentralized blockchains, has grown quickly in new products, services, and users over the past few years. TVL (Total Value Locked) is a common metric to measure the amount of value within DeFi and has been in the tens of billions of dollars. Since blockchain and crypto itself are relatively new, DeFi which itself is an ecosystem within blockchain, is even newer.\nBuilders continue to build new products and features for DeFi which enable open access to peer-to-peer financial services utilizing crypto. Users gain awareness of blockchain, then DeFi, and start to experiment and learn about its future potential. Thus, the DeFi ecosystem is one filled with opportunities for those willing to enter it provided they are aware of its risks and benefits.\nAs DeFi is a nascent space, there is a potential risk because DeFi services use open-source software protocols built on decentralized blockchains. This can pose financial risks when trading assets, and also security risks when it comes to using DeFi products/applications that can have technical bugs and flaws that can steal user funds locked in these products/applications.\nHowever, there are certain ways to mitigate some of these risks by being aware of certain aspects before getting involved with DeFi. But, a user must always be aware that there are no guarantees of rewards and must balance potential risk with potential rewards.\nIn this blog, we ll outline some of the basic strategies you can use to start learning DeFi and have a stronger knowledge base.\nDeFi is a very broad space, and also part of the blockchain industry, which is even bigger. Before we start, it ll be useful to delineate where the DeFi space starts properly, at least how this article will define it.\nBy DeFi, we mean interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) that use decentralized blockchain-based smart contracts to validate business logic. These dApps don t have intermediaries and utilize smart contracts to secure user funds.\nThe business logic of these dApps runs on top of a distributed or decentralized blockchain such as Cardano or Ethereum. That rules out any financial product running on top of a blockchain built by a centralized crypto exchange or one issued by a private company.\nDeFi runs the gamut from straightforward applications to complex financial systems. The best way to start is to dip your toes in DeFi by identifying a few simpler and common strategies that not only showcase the power of DeFi but also help to build experience in the field.\nCommon sense would also dictate that you start by experimenting with a small amount to get familiar with certain DeFi features. Remember that any strategy still carries user risks and is not a guarantee of 100 security, but are just some of the more common basic ways to start getting involved with DeFi.\nLet s look at a few of these basic and common strategies:\nThis might seem to be common sense again, but it is a very basic strategy to get started with DeFi. In this context, DYOR means checking the legitimacy of the dApp s website and URL, security history, user base, TVL, and other comments made by its users in online communities and social media such as X.\nWhat are people saying online? Have there been any major security breaches? Has the dApp been security audited? Who is the developer behind the dApp? Is the URL verified? How many users does the dApp have? Is there a significant amount of TVL? How do I connect a wallet and funds/tokens?\nAsk yourself these questions first and take the time to do your own research before committing any funds to a DeFi dApp.\nThe most straightforward DeFi strategy is to stake tokens or crypto to gain yield over time. It s the most basic of strategies because calculating the profit of a staking platform is very simple. It s the interest offered over the period of time the asset is staked.\nIn most cases for tokens, the locking period forbids the withdrawal of the asset. This means that during a downturn in the price, it s not possible to remove it from the smart contract and sell it. This is not true for every type of staking smart contract, but most of them require a locking period.\nCardano and its native crypto ADA are unique because staking is liquid and self-custodial. A user s staked ADA can be removed at any point, so the risks of this strategy are reduced dramatically.\nNext, we have another simple DeFi strategy that can be used for those unfamiliar with the space. It s minting stablecoins using an algorithm to create a peg with the US dollar.\nStablecoins use a cryptocurrency as a reserve to mint stablecoins. These are permissionless assets and can be minted by anyone. In most cases, the reserve requirements have to be above the created amount of the stablecoin, also known as over-collateralization.\nFor example, to mint 100 dollars of stablecoin, a user would need to provide 160 in a cryptocurrency. In our case, it would be ADA that provides the asset for the reserve and becomes the collateral posted.\nAgain, with this strategy, the only variable is the amount of the reserve required. The risk is that if the ADA falls in price and the original amount is not enough to maintain the collateral required, the contract enters into liquidation. A user must be aware of this risk.\nThis strategy allows users to familiarize themselves with algorithmic stablecoins, collateral requirements, and liquidations. The stablecoins themselves don t provide any sort of yield, but they can be used in the rest of the DeFi ecosystem while the reserves are to be maintained at a level above the liquidation threshold.\nAnother strategy is providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX) pool. It s a strategy that involves locking a pair of tokens by adding a 50/50 supply of the pair to the chosen liquidity pool. By providing liquidity to the pool, the user gains a portion of the fees when people trade that specific pair of tokens.\nThere is risk in this strategy in that the liquidity provider is affected by impermanent loss, which is a phenomenon that happens when one of the tokens in the pair rapidly loses its value. At that moment, the liquidity provider has a larger amount of the less valuable token.\nIf the liquidity provider removes the liquidity, then the loss is incurred and becomes a concrete loss. If the user leaves the token in the pool, and later the token recovers its value up to the original amount, then the loss is erased. Of course, there is no guarantee the token will ever recover.\nThat s the reason why providing liquidity is a much more advanced strategy. The liquidity provider not only needs to factor in the fees as a source of profit but also the risk of the assets falling in price, which can be very difficult.\nBut it remains a strategy for those starting in DeFi.\nEnroll now!\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are collaborating to host a 2-day workshop on DeFi for business and finance professionals in Singapore in January 2024.\nThis 2-day DeFi workshop aims to provide you with a comprehensive overview of both blockchain and DeFi, enabling participants to make informed decisions, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of DeFi.
