    "prompt": "CIP0001?",
    "completion": "A Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) is a formalised design document for the Cardano community and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed. A CIP provides information or describes a change to the Cardano ecosystem, processes, or environment concisely and in sufficient technical detail. In this CIP, we explain what a CIP is, how the CIP process functions, the role of the CIP Editors, and how users should go about proposing, discussing, and structuring a CIP.\nThe Cardano Foundation intends CIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and documenting design decisions that have gone into Cardano. Plus, because CIPs are text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of significant changes affecting Cardano.\nCIPs aim to address two challenges mainly:\nThe CIP process does not by itself offer any form of governance. For example, it does not govern the process by which proposed changes to the Cardano protocol are implemented and deployed. Yet, it is a crucial, community-driven component of the governance decision pipeline as it helps to collect thoughts and proposals in an organised fashion. Additionally, specific projects may choose to actively engage with the CIP process for some or all changes to their project.\nThis document outlines the technical structure of the CIP and the technical requirements of the submission and review process. The history, social features and human elements of the CIP process are described the CIP repository Wiki.\nA CIP is, first and foremost, a document which proposes a solution to a well-defined problem. Documents are Markdown files with a Preamble and a set of pre-defined sections. CIPs authors must abide by the general structure, though they are free to organise each section as they see fit.\nThe structure of a CIP file is summarised in the table below:\nMotivation\nN/A\nNote Each of these section titles (Abstract onward) should be an H2 heading (beginning with markdown ##). Subsections like Versioning or Acceptance Criteria should be H3 headings (e.g. ### Versioning). Don't include a H1 title heading (markdown #): for web friendly contexts, this will be generated from the Preamble.\n##\n### Versioning\n#\nEach CIP must begin with a YAML key:value style header preamble (also known as front matter data), preceded and followed by three hyphens (---).\n---\nCIP\nTitle\n-\nStatus\nCategory\nAuthors\nImplementors\nN/A\n[]\nDiscussions\nSolution-To\nCreated\nLicense\nFor example:\n--- CIP: 1 Title: CIP Process Status: Active Category: Meta Authors: - Frederic Johnson <frederic.johnson@cardanofoundation.org> - Sebastien Guillemot <sebastien@dcspark.io> - Matthias Benkort <matthias.benkort@cardanofoundation.org> - Duncan Coutts <duncan.coutts@iohk.io> Implementors: N/A Discussions: - https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/366 Created: 2020-03-21 License: CC-BY-4.0 ---\n--- CIP: 1 Title: CIP Process Status: Active Category: Meta Authors: - Frederic Johnson <frederic.johnson@cardanofoundation.org> - Sebastien Guillemot <sebastien@dcspark.io> - Matthias Benkort <matthias.benkort@cardanofoundation.org> - Duncan Coutts <duncan.coutts@iohk.io> Implementors: N/A Discussions: - https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/366 Created: 2020-03-21 License: CC-BY-4.0 ---\nEspecially because Markdown link syntax is not supported in the header preamble, labels can be added to clarify list items; e.g.:\nDiscussions: - Original-PR: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/366\nDiscussions: - Original-PR: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/366\nNote A reference template is available in .github/CIP-TEMPLATE.md\nA CIP must be stored in a specific folder named after its number (4-digit, left-padded with 0) and in a file called README.md. Before a number is assigned, a placeholder folder name should be used (e.g. CIP-my-new-feature). After a number has been assigned, rename the folder.\n0\nREADME.md\nCIP-my-new-feature\nAdditional supporting files (such as diagrams, binary specifications, dialect grammars, JSON schemas etc.) may be added to the CIP's folder under freely chosen names.\nFor example:\nCIP-0010 ├── README.md ├── registry.json └── registry.schema.json\nCIP-0010 ├── README.md ├── registry.json └── registry.schema.json\nWhile CIPs are mainly technical documents meant to be read primarily by developers -- and thus often written in English; some may be translated into various languages to increase their outreach. Any file in a CIP folder may also include translated content satisfying the following rules:\nAny translated file shall share a common basename with its original source.\nTranslation file basenames must have a suffix using an ISO 639-1 language code, separated by a dot . character. (e.g. README.fr.md).\n.\nREADME.fr.md\nWhen no language code is provided as suffix, the default language for the document is assumed to be English (UK/US).\nTranslated CIPs (i.e. README files), must not include the original preamble. They must, however, include the following preamble as yaml frontmatter data:\nREADME\nCIP\nSource\nTitle\nRevision\n12ab34c\nTranslators\nJohn Doe <john.doe@email.domain>\nLanguage\nfr\nCIPs must indicate how the defined Specification is versioned. Note this does not apply to the CIP text, for which annotated change logs are automatically generated and available through the GitHub UI as a history of CIP files and directories.\nAuthors are free to describe any approach to versioning that allows versioned alterations to be added without author oversight. Stipulating that the proposal must be superseded by another is also considered to be valid versioning.\nA single Versioning scheme can be placed either as a subsection of the Specification section or in an optional Versioning top-level section near the end. If the Specification contains multiple specification subsections, each of these can have a Versioning subsection within it.\nCIPs are licensed in the public domain. More so, they must be licensed under one of the following licenses. Each new CIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. In addition, each license must be referenced by its respective abbreviation below in the \"Copyright\" section.\nWarning\nAll licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Cardano Improvement Proposal unless a later CIP extends this one to add them.\nCIPs can have three statuses: Proposed, Active or Inactive. The CIP Process section highlights how CIPs move through these statuses; no CIP should be given one of these statuses without satisfying the criteria described here below.\nProposed\nActive\nInactive\nNote There is no \"draft\" status: a proposal which has not been merged (and hence exists in a PR) is a draft CIP. Draft CIPs should include the status they are aiming for on acceptance. Typically, but not always, this will be 'Proposed'.\nA 'Proposed' CIP is any CIP that meets the essential CIP criteria but is not yet 'Active'. The criteria that must meet a CIP to be merged as 'Proposed' are:\nAn 'Active' CIP has taken effect according to the criteria defined in its 'Path to Active' section. Said differently, each CIP defines by which criteria it can become 'Active' and those criteria are included in the review process. Exact criteria thereby depends on the nature of the CIP, typically:\nActive\nA proposal that is 'Active' is considered complete and is synonymous with \"production readiness\" when it comes to the maturity of a solution. 'Active' CIPs will not be updated substantially (apart from minor edits, proofreading and added precisions). They can, nevertheless, be challenged through new proposals if need be.\nAn 'Inactive' CIP describes any proposal that does not fit into the other types. A CIP can therefore be 'Inactive' for various reasons (e.g. obsolete, superseded, abandoned). Hence the status must indicate a justification between parentheses; for example:\nStatus: Inactive (superseded by CIP-0001)\nStatus: Inactive (superseded by CIP-0001)\nThis must be subdivided into two sub-sections:\n'Acceptance Criteria'\nThis sub-section must define a list of criteria by which the proposal can become active. Criteria must relate to observable metrics or deliverables and be reviewed by editors and project maintainers when applicable. For example: \"The changes to the ledger rules are implemented and deployed on Cardano mainnet by a majority of the network\", or \"The following key projects have implemented support for this standard\".\n'Implementation Plan'\nThis sub-section should define the plan by which a proposal will meet its acceptance criteria, when applicable. More, proposals that require implementation work in a specific project may indicate one or more implementors. Implementors must sign off on the plan and be referenced in the document's preamble.\nIn particular, an implementation that requires a hard-fork should explicitly mention it in its 'Implementation Plan'.\nNote the statuses of Proposed and Active both require a Path to Active section, making this a required section for all viable proposals. Even if a CIP is edited or submitted with an Inactive status, it may still be helpful to have a Path to Active if there are conditions that might lead to its acceptance or implementation.\nProposed\nActive\nInactive\nPath to Active\nCIPs are classified into distinct categories that help organise (and thus, find) them. Categories are meant to be flexible and evolve as new domains emerge. Authors may leave the category as ? should they not be sure under which category their proposal falls; editors will eventually assign one or reject the proposal altogether should it relate to an area where the CIP process does not apply.\n?\nSubmissions can be made to these categories whenever relevant, without following any particular submission guidelines:\nAdditionally, representatives of ecosystem categories may explicitly enlist their categories (see next section) to suggest a closer relationship with the CIP process. The following categories are confirmed as enlisted according to CIPs which define that relationship:\nThese tentatively enlisted categories await CIPs to describe any enlistment relationship:\nProject representatives intending to follow an \"enlisted\" category above agree to coordinate with related development by sharing efforts to review and validate new proposals. It should be noted that single organisations can no longer represent any ecosystem or development category, which makes these enlistment guidelines both decentralised and cooperative, including whenever possible:\nAny guidelines for this cooperation should be described by a dedicated CIP whenever possible. When such a CIP is posted or supersedes another one, it will be entered into the above table in the Categories section. Participants of enlisted categories should follow the requirements outlined in that CIP and should update such proposals whenever these requirements or relationships change.\nWarning A positive review by any enlisted project representative does not constitute a commitment to implement the CIP. It is still the CIP author's responsibility to create an implementation plan and identify implementors.\nEditors occasionally invite representatives from enlisted categories to speak during review meetings and solicit them for ultimate approvals of proposals in their area of expertise.\nNote Optionally, projects may show their enlisting using the following badge on their introductory README:\n![https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/master/.github/badge.svg)\n![https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/master/.github/badge.svg)\nProposals must be submitted to the cardano-foundation/CIPs repository as a pull request named after the proposal's title. The pull request title should not include a CIP number (and use ? instead as number); the editors will assign one. Discussions may precede a proposal. Early reviews and discussions streamline the process down the line.\n?\nNote Pull requests should not include implementation code: any code bases should instead be provided as links to a code repository.\nNote Proposals addressing a specific CPS should also be listed in the corresponding CPS header, in 'Proposed Solutions', to keep track of ongoing work.\nWhen a CIP title and subject matter share a common element, begin the CIP title with that common element and end it with the specific portion, delimited with the - character. Example (CIP-0095):\n-\nWeb-Wallet Bridge - Governance\nCIP editors will help determine these common elements and, whenever necessary, rename both CIP document titles and PR titles accordingly. The objective is to provide commonly recognisable names for similar developments (e.g. multiple extensions to another CIP or scheme).\nIn the original comment for your pull request, please include a link to the directory or the README.md for the CIP in your working branch, so readers and reviewers can easily follow your work. This makes it easier for editors and the community to read and review your proposal.\nREADME.md\nNote If this link changes (e.g. from the CIP directory being renamed), please keep this link updated.\nAuthors shall champion their proposals. The CIP process is a collaborative effort, which implies discussions between different groups of individuals. While editors may provide specific inputs and help reach out to experts, authors shall actively seek feedback from the community to help move their proposal forward.\nDiscussions and comments shall mainly happen on Github in pull requests. When discussed on other mediums, we expect authors or participants to report back a summary of their discussions to the original pull request to keep track of the most critical conversations in a written form and all in one place.\nAs much as possible, commenters/reviewers shall remain unbiased in their judgement and assess proposals in good faith. Authors have the right to reject comments or feedback but are strongly encouraged to address concerns in their 'Rationale' section. Ultimately, CIP editors shall make the last call concerning the various statements made on a proposal and their treatment by the author(s).\nBy opening pull requests or posting comments, commenters and authors agree to our Code of Conduct. Any comment infringing this code of conduct shall be removed or altered without prior notice.\nNote For acceptability guidelines, including a concise review checklist, see CIP Wiki CIPs for Reviewers & Authors.\nCIP editors meet regularly in a public Discord server to go through newly proposed ideas in a triage phase. As a result of a triage, editors acknowledge new CIPs, and briefly review their preamble. Editors also assign numbers to newly proposed CIPs during this phase. Incidentally, the triage allows new CIPs to get visibility for potential reviews.\nIn every meeting, editors will also review in more depth some chosen CIPs (based on their readiness and the stability of the discussions) and assess if they meet the criteria to be merged in their aimed status.\nDuring review sessions, editors will regularly invite project maintainers or actors from the ecosystem who are deemed relevant to the meeting's agenda. However, meetings are open and held in public to encourage anyone interested in participating.\nA dedicated Discord channel may also be created for some long-running discussions to support quick chats and progress on particular topics (while still being regularly summarised on the repository).\nOnce a proposal has reached all requirements for its target status (as explained in Statuses) and has been sufficiently and faithfully discussed by community members, it is merged with its target status.\nWarning Ideas deemed unsound shall be rejected with justifications or withdrawn by the authors. Similarly, proposals that appear abandoned by their authors shall be rejected until resurrected by their authors or another community member.\nCIPs are generally merged with the status 'Proposed' until they meet their 'Path to Active' requirements. In some rare cases (mainly when written after the facts and resulting in a broad consensus), proposals may be merged as 'Active' immediately.\nEach proposal is unique and has a bespoke 'Path to Active', which must be reviewed case-by-case. There must be sufficient time between the first appearance of a proposal and its merge into the repository to ensure enough opportunity for community members to review it.\nOnce merged, implementors shall execute the CIP's 'Implementation Plan', if any. If a proposal has no implementors or no 'Implementation Plan', it may simply remain as 'Proposed' in the repository.\nWarning It is perfectly fine to submit ideas in the repository with no concrete implementation plan, yet they should be treated as such: ideas.\nBesides, once all of the 'Path to Active' requirements have been met, authors shall make another pull request to change their CIP's status to 'Active'. Editors may also do this on occasion.\nFor a full, current description of Editor workflow, see CIP Wiki CIPs for Editors.\nCIP Editors safeguard the CIP process: they form a group enforcing the process described in this document and facilitating conversations between community actors. CIP editors should strive to keep up to date with general technical discussions and Cardano proposals. For each new draft proposal submitted on cardano-foundation/CIPs an editor might review it as follows:\nCIPs that do not meet a sufficient level of quality or don't abide by the process described in this document will be rejected until their authors address review comments.\nNote that editors may provide technical feedback on proposals in some cases, although they aren't expected to be the sole technical reviewers of proposals. CIPs are, before anything, a community-driven effort. While editors are here to facilitate the discussion and mediate debates, they aren't necessarily technical experts on all subjects covered by CIPs.\nTherefore, CIPs authors are encouraged to reach out to known experts to demonstrate their good faith and openness when they champion a proposal. Editors may help with such efforts but cannot be expected to do this alone.\nExisting editors or the community may nominate new editors, provided they have proven to be already existing and active contributors to the CIP process and are ready to commit some of their time to the CIP process regularly.\nThe missions of an editor include, but aren't exclusively limited to, any of the tasks listed above. Active members that seek to become listed editors may also come forth and let it be known. Any application will take the form of a pull request updating this document with a justification as the pull request's description.\nCurrent editors are listed here below:\nEmeritus editors:\nA significant friction point regarding complex CIPs is often how the main problem is stated. The 'Motivation' is often insufficient (or simply underused) to describe various aspects of a problem, its scope, and its constraints. This lack of clarity leads, in the end, to poorly defined issues and debates over solutions that feel unclear amongst different participants.\nThe introduction of CIP-9999: Cardano Problem Statements addresses this gap by introducing a formal template and structure around problem statements. However, requiring any CIP to be preceded by a CPS would likely be overkill and become an obstacle to the overall adoption of the CIP process for more straightforward problems. At this stage, it is reasonable to think either (a) that CIP authors would foresee the complexity and state their problem as a CPS beforehand or (b) that editors or reviewers will require authors to write a CPS to clarify a perhaps ambiguous motivation on complex CIPs.\nWe also anticipate project maintainers or community actors will write standalone CPS to document well-known issues for which the design space is still to be explored.\nA recurring pain point with the previous CIP process was the lack of clear ownership/accountability of some proposals affecting remote parts of the ecosystem. On several occasions, proposals from community members have concerned, for example, core components of the Cardano architecture. However, those proposals have been hard to move forward with and to either reject or turn into concrete action steps. Authors usually do not have the technical proficiency required to implement them and rely on the core engineering team in charge of projects to do so. Thus, explicit compliance and collaboration of those engineering teams are necessary to propose changes affecting their work.\nBy asking teams to explicitly state their compliance with the CIP process with clear, accountable owners (as individuals), it becomes plausible to now establish a dialogue between community members and technical leadership responsible for specific ecosystem projects. Furthermore, projects that, on the contrary, do not seek to participate in CIP or receive contributions in the form of CIP/CPS are automatically taken out of this process, saving time and energy for both reviewers and authors.\nThe 'Editors' section now details how to become a CIP editor. The process aims to be simple and define those involved the most with editorship tasks as editors. Thus, being an active contributor to the CIP process as a prerequisite only makes sense. We want to leave the room open for either existing editors to refer an existing community as an editor or for community members to formulate that request explicitly.\nThere are no delays or number of contributions necessary to pretend to become an editor. Those criteria are often less relevant than others and more subjective, such as the quality of one's participation or their relevance. Since editors also need to work with one another in the end, it seems logical that existing editors have their final say about whom they intend to work with.\ntype\nThe type field in the header has shown to be:\ntype\ntype\nAn ad-hoc classification by non-rigid categories, which may evolve over time to reflect ecosystem areas, seems better suited. Therefore, we do not require authors to categorise their CIPs; instead, categories will be added and maintained by editors as a side task atop the CIP process.\nOver time we've learnt that the valuable information a status should convey is really about the readiness of a CIP, especially regarding standards. For a long time, many CIPs have lived as Draft despite some being used in dozens of systems. Consequently, the status has lost a bit of its meaning. The frontier between Draft and Proposed hasn't always been clear, and it has proven challenging to come up with good statuses to describe all possible rejections. So instead, the current division of statuses is as simple-as-it-can-be and remains flexible regarding rejections.\nDraft\nstatus\nDraft\nProposed\nThe choice of a code of conduct follows other popular open source initiatives. It serves as a good, unilaterally accepted foundation which can be later revisited if necessary.\nThe proposal has been reviewed by the community and sufficiently advertised on various channels.\nAll major concerns or feedback have been addressed.

    "completion": "This article describes, in human-readable terms, the coin selection algorithms used by Cardano Wallet and other parts of the Cardano ecosystem.\nIn the context of this article, coin selection refers to the process of choosing unspent coins from a wallet (or UTxO set) in order to pay money to one or more recipients.\nThis document was written to help people gain an understanding of the coin selection algorithms used in Cardano without having to read through and understand Cardano source code.\nWe aim to provide descriptions of algorithms that:\nWhere appropriate, we also provide mathematical descriptions, for added clarity.\nCoin selection is a large, complex topic, with many difficult problems to solve. However, all software that performs coin selection must ultimately deal with at least the following pair of problems:\nThis article concerns itself with the former problem of how to generate a coin selection.\nProblems relating to network fees, and how to adjust coin selections to pay for such fees, are outside the scope of this article.\nThis section introduces the fundamental concepts behind coin selection, provides a discussion of why coin selection is a non-trivial problem, and describes important goals of coin selection algorithms.\nCoin selection is the process of choosing unspent coins from a wallet in order to pay money to one or more recipients.\nIn the familiar world of physical money, our wallets hold value in the form of coins and banknotes.\nWhen making a payment to someone, we typically select a combination of coins and banknotes from a wallet that, when added together, have enough value to cover the amount required.\nIdeally, we'd always be able to select just enough to cover the exact amount. However, given that coins and banknotes have fixed values (and cannot be subdivided without destroying their value), it's often impossible to select the exact amount required. In such cases, we typically give the recipient more than the required amount, and then receive the excess value back as change.\n:bulb: Example\nAlice wishes to pay for her lunch.\nThe total price comes to 2.50 (2 euros and 50 cents). In her wallet, she has five one-euro coins, and one ten-euro note.\nNote that there is no combination of coins (or notes) in her wallet that when added together give a total of 2.50, but there are several possible combinations that exceed the total.\nTo solve this problem, Alice selects one of these combinations: three one-euro coins. She uses the coins to make the payment, and then receives one 50-cent coin as change.\nSimilarly to how a physical wallet holds value in the form of unspent coins and banknotes, a Cardano wallet holds value in the form of unspent transaction outputs. An unspent transaction output is the result of a previous transaction that transferred money to the wallet, where the value has not yet been spent by another transaction. Each unspent transaction output has an associated coin value, and the total value of a wallet is the sum of these coin values. Collectively, the set of unspent transaction outputs is known as the UTxO set.\nWhen using a Cardano wallet to make a payment, the wallet software must select a combination of unspent outputs from the wallet's UTxO set, so that the total value of selected outputs is enough to cover the target amount.\nJust as with physical coins and notes, unspent outputs from the UTxO set cannot be subdivided, and must either be spent completely in a given transaction, or not be spent at all. Similarly to a transaction with physical money, the wallet software must select a combination of unspent outputs whose total value is greater than the target amount, and then arrange that change is paid back to the wallet.\nCoin selection refers to the process of selecting a combination of unspent outputs from a wallet's UTxO set in order to make one or more payments, and computing the set of change to be paid back to the wallet.\nThere are a number of issues which make the problem of coin selection more complicated than would initially appear.\nEach transaction has a maximum size, as defined by the protocol. The size of a transaction increases as we add more inputs or outputs.\nTherefore, there's a practical limit on the number of coins we can select for any given transaction.\nOne simple strategy for selecting coins might be to mimic what we do when making a payment with coins and banknotes in the physical world. By giving the recipient an amount that's as close as possible to the amount they're expecting, we can minimize the amount of change they need to return to us.\nHowever, trying to replicate this strategy with a UTxO-based wallet has an undesirable effect: minimizing the total value of selected coins will also minimize the value of change returned to the wallet. When repeated over time, this strategy will tend to cause an accumulation of tiny outputs in the wallet's UTxO set known as dust.\nDust outputs are a problem, because even if the total value of dust in a wallet is more than enough to cover a given target amount, if we attempt to include that dust in a given transaction, we may run out of space (by reaching the transaction size limit) before we can cover the target amount.\nFor more information on dust avoidance, see Self Organisation in Coin Selection.\nOne simple strategy for generating change might be to mimic what a shop assistant does when accepting a payment in the real world, which is to minimize the number of coins and banknotes that they return to the customer. This is beneficial for the shop, as it reduces the chances of them running out of change, and beneficial for the customer, as it reduces the amount of change that they have to carry around in their wallet.\nAnalogously, when generating change for a UTxO-based wallet, we might be tempted to use the simple strategy of just creating a single change output with the exact excess value.\nHowever, using this strategy has an undesirable effect: the repeated act of minimizing the number of change outputs will tend (over time) to reduce the number of entries in a wallet's UTxO set. This is bad for two reasons:\nHaving a small UTxO set limits the number of future payments that we can make in parallel.\nThe approach of coalescing all change into a single output is widely considered to have negative privacy implications.\nIn light of the issues described above, we'd ideally like for our coin selection algorithms to be able to:\nlimit, over the course of time, the amount of dust that accumulates in the UTxO set.\nmaintain, over the course of time, a UTxO set with useful outputs: that is, outputs that allow us to process future payments with a reasonably small number of inputs.\nThe Background section introduces the fundamental concepts behind coin selection, provides a discussion of why coin selection is a non-trivial problem, and describes the goals of coin selection algorithms.\nThe Interface section gives a description of the common interface unifying all coin selection algorithms used within Cardano Wallet, the standard parameter types, result types, and error types used by this interface, and a description of the properties that all conforming implementations are expected to satisfy.\nThe Algorithms section gives detailed descriptions of each of the individual coin selection algorithms used in Cardano Wallet, along with step-by-step descriptions of the computations involved.\nThe Reference Implementations section provides links to reference implementations of each algorithm in various languages.\nThis section defines common terms that are used throughout this document.\nAn address is a unique identifier that represents a payment recipient, a destination for a payment.\nAddresses are typically owned (and generated) by individual wallets.\nIn general, coin selection algorithms are agnostic to the type of addresses used to identify payment recipients. Any address type may be used, so long as the set of possible addresses is totally-ordered.\nA coin value is a non-negative integer value that represents a number of Lovelace.\nOne Ada is exactly equal to one million Lovelace.\nIn a UTxO-based blockchain, a transaction is a binding between inputs and outputs.\ninput #1 >---+ +---> output #1 \\ / input #2 >-----+------+ / \\ input #3 >---+ +---> output #2\ninput #1 >---+ +---> output #1 \\ / input #2 >-----+------+ / \\ input #3 >---+ +---> output #2\nA transaction input is a unique reference to a single output from a previous transaction.\nIn general, coin selection algorithms are agnostic to the type of references used to identify outputs from previous transactions. Any type may be used, so long as the set of possible references is totally-ordered, and so long as it is possible to determine the coin value associated with any given reference.\nIn the case of Cardano and other UTxO-based blockchains, this reference generally consists of a pair of values (h, n), where:\nA transaction output consists of a pair of values (a, v), where:\nA spent transaction output is an output from an existing transaction that has already been referenced as an input within a later transaction on the blockchain.\nIn effect, the coin value associated with that transaction output has been spent, and cannot be reused.\nAn unspent transaction output is an output from an existing transaction that has not yet been referenced as an input within a later transaction.\nIn effect, the coin value associated with that transaction output has not yet been spent, and is still available.\nA UTxO set is a set of unspent transaction outputs.\nThis term is commonly used in two ways:\nTo describe the complete set of all unspent transaction outputs within a blockchain.\nTo describe the subset of unspent transaction outputs associated with a wallet. The UTxO set of a wallet represents the total unspent value associated with that wallet.\nFrom the point of view of a coin selection algorithm, each member of a UTxO set can be represented as a pair of the form (u, v), where:\nIn general, coin selection algorithms are agnostic to the type of references used to identify unspent outputs from previous transactions. Any type may be used, so long as the set of possible references is totally-ordered.\nIn practice however, the type of each unique reference u is equivalent to the type of a transaction input, as transaction inputs are simply references to unspent outputs from previous transactions.\nIn the context of a wallet, a change output is a transaction output that transfers value back to the wallet, rather than to an external payment recipient. The address associated with a change output is generated by the wallet, and belongs to the wallet.\nChange ouputs are necessary in a UTxO-based blockchain, as the value associated with any given transaction input must be spent entirely by the transaction that includes it.\nWhen selecting entries from a UTxO set to include as inputs in a transaction, a coin selection algorithm will generally not be able to select inputs that precisely match the total value of all payments to external recipients, and will therefore need to select more than is strictly required. To avoid the destruction of value, selection algorithms create change outputs to return the excess value back to the wallet.\nA dust output is a transaction output with an associated coin value that is:\nDust outputs are a problem, because even if the total value of dust in a wallet is more than enough to cover a given payment amount, if we attempt to include that dust in a given transaction, we may run out of space (by reaching the transaction size limit) before we can cover the target amount.\nAll coin selection algorithms used by Cardano Wallet implement a common interface.\nAt the most fundamental level, a coin selection algorithm is a mathematical function that when applied to a requested output set and an initial UTxO set, will produce a coin selection: the basis for a transaction in a UTxO-based blockchain.\nThis section describes:\nIn this section, the terms coin selection algorithm and coin selection function will be used interchangeably.\nAll coin selection functions accept the following parameters:\nRequested Output Set\nA list of payments to be made to recipient addresses, encoded as a list of transaction outputs.\nInitial UTxO Set\nA UTxO set from which the coin selection algorithm can select entries, to cover payments listed in the requested output set.\nIn the context of a wallet, this parameter would normally be assigned with the wallet's complete UTxO set, giving the coin selection algorithm access to the total value associated with that wallet.\nMaximum Input Count\nAn upper bound on the number of UTxO entries that the coin selection algorithm is permitted to select from the initial UTxO set.\nThis parameter is necessary for blockchains that impose an upper limit on the size of transactions.\nAll coin selection functions produce the following result values:\nCoin Selection\nA coin selection is the basis for a transaction in a UTxO-based blockchain.\nIt is a record with three fields:\nA set of inputs, equivalent to a subset of the initial UTxO set.\nFrom the point of view of a wallet, this represents the value that has been selected from the wallet in order to cover the total payment value.\nA set of outputs (see transaction output).\nRepresents the set of payments to be made to recipient addresses.\nA set of change values (see change output), where each change value is simply a coin value.\nFrom the point of view of a wallet, this represents the change to be returned to the wallet.\nRemaining UTxO Set\nThe remaining UTxO set is a subset of the initial UTxO set.\nIt represents the set of values that remain after the coin selection algorithm has removed values to pay for entries in the requested output set.\nIn the context of a wallet, if a coin selection algorithm is applied to the wallet's complete UTxO set, then the remaining UTxO set represents the updated UTxO set of that wallet.\nAll coin selection algorithms satisfy a common set of properties: general rules that govern the relationship between the parameters supplied to coin selection functions and the results they are allowed to produce.\nThis property states that the total value of inputs in the resulting coin selection result is sufficient to cover the total value of the requested output set.\nIn particular:\nWhere:\nvrequested\nis the total value of the requested output set\nvselected\nis the total value of the inputs field of the coin selection result.\nThis property states that the correct amount of change was generated.\nIn particular:\nWhere:\nvchange\nis the total value of the change field of the coin selection result.\nvrequested\nis the total value of the requested output set\nvselected\nis the total value of the inputs field of the coin selection result.\nThis property states that every entry in the initial UTxO set is included in either the inputs set of the generated coin selection, or in the remaining UTxO set, but not both.\nIf a UTxO entry is selected by the coin selection algorithm, it is included in the coin selection inputs set.\nIf a UTxO entry is not selected by the coin selection algorithm, it is included in the remaining UTxO set.\nThe following laws hold:\nAnd:\nWhere:\nUinitial\nis the initial UTxO set.\nUremaining\nis the remaining UTxO set.\nUselected\nis the value of the inputs field of the coin selection result.\nThis property states that the requested output set is conserved in the coin selection result.\nIn particular, the outputs field of the coin selection result should be equal to the requested output set.\nThere are a number of ways in which a coin selection algorithm can fail:\nUTxO Balance Insufficient\nThis failure occurs when the total value of the entries within the initial UTxO set (the amount of money available) is less than the the total value of all entries in the requested output set (the amount of money required).\nUTxO Not Fragmented Enough\nThis failure occurs when the number of entries in the initial UTxO set is smaller than the number of entries in the requested output set, for algorithms that impose the restriction that a single UTxO entry can only be used to pay for at most one output.\nUTxO Fully Depleted\nThis failure occurs if the algorithm depletes all entries from the initial UTxO set before it is able to pay for all outputs in the requested output set.\nThis can happen even if the total value of entries within the initial UTxO set is greater than the total value of all entries in the requested output set, due to various restrictions that coin selection algorithms impose on themselves when selecting UTxO entries.\nMaximum Input Count Exceeded\nThis failure occurs when another input must be selected by the algorithm in order to continue making progress, but doing so will increase the size of the resulting selection beyond an acceptable limit, specified by the maximum input count parameter.\nThis section describes the coin selection algorithms used by Cardano Wallet, along with step-by-step descriptions of the computations involved.\nAll algorithms implement a common interface, as described in the Interface section.\nThere are two main algorithms used by Cardano Wallet:\nIn general, Cardano Wallet gives priority to the Random-Improve algorithm, as experimental evidence shows that it performs better at minimising dust and maintaining a UTxO set with useful outputs. (See Self Organisation in Coin Selection for more details.)\nHowever, in rare cases, the Random-Improve algorithm may fail to produce a result. In such cases, Cardano Wallet will fall back to the Largest-First algorithm.\nThe Largest-First coin selection algorithm considers UTxO set entries in descending order of value, from largest to smallest.\nWhen applied to a set of requested outputs, the algorithm repeatedly selects entries from the initial UTxO set until the total value of selected entries is greater than or equal to the total value of requested outputs.\nThe name of the algorithm is taken from the idea that the largest UTxO entry is always selected first. Specifically:\nA given UTxO entry u1 with value v1 can be selected if and only if there is no other unselected entry u2 with value v2 where v2 v1.\nAt all stages of processing, the algorithm maintains the following pieces of state:\nAvailable UTxO List\nThis is initially equal to the initial UTxO set, sorted into descending order of coin value.\nThe head of the list is always the remaining UTxO entry with the largest coin value.\nEntries are incrementally removed from the head of the list as the algorithm proceeds, until enough value has been selected.\nSelected UTxO Set\nThis is initially equal to the empty set.\nThe algorithm proceeds according to the following sequence of steps:\nStep 1\nIf the available UTxO list is empty:\nIf the available UTxO list is not empty:\nStep 2\nCompare the total size nselected of the selected UTxO set with the maximum input count nmax.\nIf nselected nmax then:\nIf nselected nmax then:\nStep 3\nCompare the total value vselected of the selected UTxO set to the total value vrequested of the requested output set:\nStep 4\nReturn a coin selection result where:\nThe inputs set is equal to the selected UTxO set.\nThe outputs set is equal to the requested output set.\nIf vselected vrequested then:\nIf vselected = vrequested then:\nThe Random-Improve coin selection algorithm works in two phases:\nIn the first phase, the algorithm iterates through each of the requested outputs in descending order of coin value, from largest to smallest. For each output, the algorithm repeatedly selects entries at random from the initial UTxO set, until each requested output has been associated with a set of UTxO entries whose total value is enough to pay for that ouput.\nIn the second phase, the algorithm attempts to expand each existing UTxO selection with additional values taken at random from the initial UTxO set, to the point where the total value of each selection is as close as possible to twice the value of its associated output.\nAfter the above phases are complete, for each output of value voutput and accompanying UTxO selection of value vselection, the algorithm generates a single change output of value vchange, where:\nvchange = vselection voutput\nSince the goal of the second phase was to expand each selection to the point where its total value is approximately twice the value of its associated output, this corresponds to a change output whose target value is approximately equal to the value of the output itself:\nvchange = vselection voutput\nvchange 2voutput voutput\nvchange voutput\nThe Random-Improve algorithm imposes the following cardinality restriction:\nAs a result of this restriction, the algorithm will fail with a UTxO Not Fragmented Enough error if the number of entries in the initial UTxO set is smaller than the number of entries in the requested output set.\nAt all stages of processing, the algorithm maintains the following pieces of state:\nAvailable UTxO Set\nThis is initially equal to the initial UTxO set.\nAccumulated Coin Selection\nThe accumulated coin selection is a coin selection where all fields are initially equal to the empty set.\nThe algorithm proceeds in two phases.\nIn this phase, the algorithm iterates through each of the requested outputs in descending order of coin value, from largest to smallest.\nFor each output of value v, the algorithm repeatedly selects entries at random from the available UTxO set, until the total value of selected entries is greater than or equal to v. The selected entries are then associated with that output, and removed from the available UTxO set.\nThis phase ends when every output has been associated with a selection of UTxO entries.\nIn this phase, the algorithm attempts to improve upon each of the UTxO selections made in the previous phase, by conservatively expanding the selection made for each output in order to generate improved change values.\nDuring this phase, the algorithm:\nprocesses outputs in ascending order of coin value.\ncontinues to select values from the available UTxO set.\nincrementally populates the accumulated coin selection.\nFor each output of value v, the algorithm:\nCalculates a target range for the total value of inputs used to pay for that output, defined by the triplet:\n(minimum, ideal, maximum) = (v, 2v, 3v)\nAttempts to improve upon the existing UTxO selection for that output, by repeatedly selecting additional entries at random from the available UTxO set, stopping when the selection can be improved upon no further.\nA selection with value v1 is considered to be an improvement over a selection with value v0 if all of the following conditions are satisfied:\nCondition 1: we have moved closer to the ideal value:\nabs (ideal v1) abs (ideal v0)\nCondition 2: we have not exceeded the maximum value:\nv1 maximum\nCondition 3: when counting cumulatively across all outputs considered so far, we have not selected more than the maximum number of UTxO entries specified by Maximum Input Count.\nCreates a change value for the output, equal to the total value of the improved UTxO selection for that output minus the value v of that output.\nUpdates the accumulated coin selection:\nThis phase ends when every output has been processed, or when the available UTxO set has been exhausted, whichever occurs sooner.\nWhen both phases are complete, the algorithm terminates.\nThe accumulated coin selection is returned to the caller as the coin selection result.\nThe available UTxO set is returned to the caller as the remaining UTxO set result.\n-\nThere are several motivating principles behind the design of the algorithm.\nThe probability that random selection will choose dust entries from a UTxO set increases with the proportion of dust in the set.\nTherefore, for a UTxO set with a large amount of dust, there's a high probability that a random subset will include a large amount of dust.\nOver time, selecting entries randomly in this way will tend to limit the amount of dust that accumulates in the UTxO set.\nAs mentioned in the Goals section, it is desirable that coin selection algorithms, over time, are able to create UTxO sets that have useful outputs: outputs that will allow us to process future payments with a reasonably small number of inputs.\nIf for each payment request of value v we create a change output of roughly the same value v, then we will end up with a distribution of change values that matches the typical value distribution of payment requests.\n:bulb: Example\nAlice often buys bread and other similar items that cost around 1.00 each.\nWhen she instructs her wallet software to make a payment for around 1.00, the software attempts to select a set of unspent transaction outputs with a total value of around 2.00.\nAs she frequently makes payments for similar amounts, transactions created by her wallet will also frequently produce change coins of around 1.00 in value.\nOver time, her wallet will self-organize to contain multiple coins of around 1.00, which are useful for the kinds of payments that Alice frequently makes.\nSearching the UTxO set for additional entries to improve our change outputs is only useful if the UTxO set contains entries that are sufficiently small enough. But it is precisely when the UTxO set contains many small entries that it is less likely for a randomly-chosen UTxO entry to push the total above the upper bound.\nThis article introduces the Random-Improve coin selection algorithm, invented by Edsko de Vries.\nIt describes the three principles of self-organisation that inform the algorithm's design, and provides experimental evidence to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness at maintaining healthy UTxO sets over time.\nReference implementations of the Largest-First algorithm are available in the following languages:\nReference implementations of the Random-Improve algorithm are available in the following languages:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

In this case, they simply see a 0 ADA wallet after syncing is over. This not only wastes the user's time, in the worst case it makes them think they either lost all their ADA or think there is a bug in the wallet implementation.\nTo solve this, we introduce a checksum that can be computed without having to perform wallet restoration.\nFirst, it's important to note that the method for generating a checksum is heavily dependent on the type of wallet (ex: BIP44, etc.). We outline an algorithm that works with most, but not all, types of wallet.\nTo satisfy (1), the checksum SHOULD be seeded from the public key for the wallet. Notably, in the BIP44 case, it should come from the bip44 account derivation level's public key.

We use 512 bytes of output to try and future-proof this algorithm (better to spread the entropy across more bits than needed than end up not capturing the full entropy in the future).\nhash1\nblake2b512\n512\nFor hash_to_32 we use CRC32. We hash a second time for the following:\nhash_to_32\nhash1\nhash1\nhash1\nCRC32\nAlthough there is no specification for CRC32 and many variations exist, in Cardano we use the CRC-32-IEEE variation.

FNV-1a is fast, easy to implement inline and gives good empirical distribution.\nNote that a different construction is needed for wallet types which do not have a public key (such as a balance tracking application which simply manages a set of addresses). In the balanace tracking case, simply hashing the set of addresses used is possible, but it means that adding & removing an address would change the checksum (possibly unintuitive). Since the checksum is meant to represent the wallet itself, we also cannot run a checksum on the name of the wallet or any other user-inputted data.\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

From the user perspective, it can be difficult to distinguish between various encoded data. From the tools developer perspective, it can also be difficult to validate inputs based only on raw bytes (in particular when encoded data often have the same length).\nTherefore, we can leverage bech32 for binary data encoding, with a set of common prefixes that can be used across tools and software to disambiguate payloads.\nWe define the following set of common prefixes with their corresponding semantic.

With Base58-encoded addresses, people have been used to look at first few characters and distinguish address this way. Not only this is cumbersome, but it is also made harder with both Shelley and Bech32-encoded addresses. On the one hand, the \"common\" part of the internal payload is much less than in Byron addresses and thus, the first bytes of the payload are varying much more. Plus, the bech32 prefix which can now be fixed makes it even more error-prone.\nTherefore, having a clear human-readable indicator regarding the network discrimination is useful.\naddr\nAddresses probably are the most user-facing object in the current Cardano eco-system. Being able to clearly identify them\n:bulb: Open question: with side-chains and multi-currencies coming soon, would it make sense to include the currency in the bech32 prefix? e.g. ada1... or ada_addr1.\nada1...\nada_addr1.\nstake\nStake addresses are references to reward account. They are used in many manipulation involving rewards (registering stake key, delegating, fetching reward balance etc..). We therefore make it a \"first-class\" object and assign it a dedicated prefix.\nsk\nvk\nBoth are rather transparent abbreviations for signing key and verification key.\nxsk\nxvk\nThe prefix x is typically used in cryptography to refer to extended keys (e.g. xpub, xprv ...).

For example, they're used in stake pool registration and retirement certificates, stake key registration, delegation, and deregistration certificates, etc. As a result, it seems useful to have a human-readable prefix by which one can discern the different kinds of verification key hashes.\nThe only prior work done towards that direction has been jcli. Historically, prefixes evolved very organically and without any agreed-upon standard. jcli is however only compatible with J rmungandr and is not intended to be compatible with the cardano-node. Therefore, there's little concern regarding compatibility here.\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "Modifying the current rewards calculation equation by substituting a n-root curved relationship between pledge and pledge benefit rewards for the current linear relationship will better achieve the original design goal of incentivizing pledge to help prevent Sybil attacks. This also reduces the unfortunate side effect in the current equation that over rewards private pools which provide no additional security benefit.\nThere are two main reasons for changing the current linear a0 pledge benefit factor in the rewards equation.\nPools pledging less than 1 million ADA see very little reward benefit. This is not a strong incentive for pool operators as at current prices that is approximately $150,000 USD.\nPrivate pools get massive reward benefit without providing any additional protection against Sybil attacks. Why should a private pool make 29 more rewards than a pool with 5m ADA pledge while doing the same work?\nThis is a modification of the maxPool function defined in section 11.8 Rewards Distribution Calculation of A Formal Specification of the Cardano Ledger .\nmaxPool = (R / (1 + a0)) * (o + (s * a0 * ((o - (s * ((z0 - o) / z0))) / z0)))\nwhere: R = ((reserve * rho) + fees) * (1 - tau) o = min(pool_stake / total_stake, z0) = z0 for fully saturated pool s = pledge / total_stake z0 = 1 / k and the following are current protocol parameters: k = 150 rho = 0.0022 a0 = 0.3 tau = .05\nThe idea is to replace s in the above equation with an n-root curve expression of pledge rather than the linear pledge value.\nWe use an expression called crossover to represent the point where the curve crosses the line and the benefit in the new and original equations is identical. Because the a0 pledge benefit is spread over the pledge range from 0 to saturation there is a dependence on k and total_stake. Since k and total_stake will likely change over time it is best to express crossover in terms of k and total_stake as follows:\ncrossover = total_stake / (k * crossover_factor)\nwhere crossover_factor is any real number greater than or equal to 1. So crossover_factor is essentially a divisor of the pool saturation amount. For example, setting crossover_factor to 20 with k = 150 and total_stake = 31 billion gives a crossover of approximately 10.3 million.\nAlso, we can parameterize the n-root curve exponent. This gives us:\ns = pow(pledge, (1 / curve_root)) * pow(crossover, ((curve_root - 1) / curve_root)) / total_stake\nThe curve_root could be set to any integer greater than 0 and when set to 1 produces the current rewards equation. The curve_root is n in n-root. For example, 1 = linear, 2 = square root, 3 = cube root, 4 = fourth root, etc.\nBy making this modification to the rewards equation we introduce two new protocol parameters, crossover_factor and curve_root, that need to be set thoughtfully.\nSee rewards.php for some simple PHP code that allows you to try different values for crossover_factor and curve_root and compare the resulting rewards to the current equation. For usage, run \"php -f rewards.php help\".\nAn interesting set of parameters as an example is:\ncurve_root = 3 crossover_factor = 8\nRunning \"php -f rewards.php 3 8\" produces:\nAssumptions Reserve: 14b Total stake: 31.7b Tx fees: 0 Fully Saturated Pool Rewards available in epoch: 29.3m Pool saturation: 211.3m\nCurve root: 3 Crossover factor: 8 Crossover: 26.4m\nPledge Rewards Benefit Alt Rwd Alt Bnft 0k 150051 0 150051 0 10k 150053 0 150458 0.27 50k 150062 0.01 150747 0.46 100k 150073 0.01 150928 0.58 200k 150094 0.03 151156 0.74 500k 150158 0.07 151551 1 1m 150264 0.14 151941 1.26 2m 150477 0.28 152432 1.59 5m 151116 0.71 153282 2.15 10m 152181 1.42 154122 2.71 20m 154311 2.84 155180 3.42 50m 160702 7.1 157012 4.64 100m 171352 14.2 158821 5.84 211.3m 195067 30 161305 7.5\nAs you can see this gives meaningful pledge benefit rewards to pools pledging less than 1m ADA.\nUsing the n-root curve pledge benefit shows a much more reasonable distribution of pledge related rewards which will encourage meaningful pledges from more pool operators thus making the network more secure against Sybil attacks. It also provides higher rewards for higher pledge without disproportionately rewarding a very few private pool operators who provide no additional security value to the network. This modification maintains the general principles of the current rewards equation and does not introduce any hard limits. It improves the incentives that were originally designed to make them more meaningful for the majority of pool operators.\nThis proposal is backwards compatible with the current reward function by setting the curve_root parameter to 1.\nAgreement by the Ledger team as defined in CIP-0084 under Expectations for ledger CIPs including \"expert opinion\" on changes to rewards & incentives.\nAuthor has offered to produce an implementation of this change as a pull request if shown where the current maxPool reward equation is implemented in the code.\n2020 Shawn McMurdo.

It is based on the JSON equivalent JSON Object Signing and Encryption RFC 7520.\nWe base our construction on COSE because all Cardano libraries already depend on CBOR due to its use in the base protocol (which means we don't need to introduce a new library).

    "completion": "This CIP is an informational CIP that describes the initial protocol parameter settings for the Shelley era of the Cardano blockchain, plus the changes that have been made. It is intended to serve as a historic record, allowing protocol parameter changes to be tracked back to the original settings.\nWe need to provide a concise description of the initial protocol parameter choices, that can be used by the community as the base for future proposed protocol changes, and that document the chain of changes to the parameters.\nThis CIP records only the changes to the protocol parameters that have actually been made. Suggested changes to protocol parameters should be proposed by preparing and submitting a new CIP, rather than editing this CIP. The following information should be included.\nWhere necessary, the summary rationale should be supported by a few paragraphs of text giving the full rationale, plus references to any external documents that are needed to understand the proposal.\nProtocol parameters are used to affect the operation of the Cardano Protocol. They may be either updatable or non-updatable. Updatable parameters can be tuned to vary the operation of the block producing protocol, impacting the proportion of pools that are federated/non-federated, how much influence the \"pledge\" has etc. Non-updatable parameters affect the fundamentals of the blockchain protocol, including defining the genesis block, basic security properties etc. Some non-updatable parameters may be embedded within the source code or implemented as software. Each major protocol version defines its own sets of updatable/non-updatable parameters.\nThe initial updatable protocol parameter values are given below (in JSON format). Any of these parameters may be changed by submitting a parameter update proposal. A change to the major protocol parameter version triggers a \"hard fork\" event. This will require stake pool operators to upgrade to a new software version that complies with the new chain production protocol as well as being able to verify the construction of the chain.\n{ \"protocolVersion\": { \"major\": 2, \"minor\": 0 }, \"nOpt\": 150, \"a0\": 0.3, \"minPoolCost\": 340000000, \"decentralisationParam\": 1.0, \"maxBlockBodySize\": 65536, \"maxBlockHeaderSize\": 1100, \"maxTxSize\": 16384, \"tau\": 0.2, \"rho\": 3.0e-3, \"poolDeposit\": 500000000, \"keyDeposit\": 2000000, \"minFeeB\": 155381, \"minFeeA\": 44, \"minUTxOValue\": 1000000, \"extraEntropy\": { \"tag\": \"NeutralNonce\" }, \"eMax\": 18 }\n{ \"protocolVersion\": { \"major\": 2, \"minor\": 0 }, \"nOpt\": 150, \"a0\": 0.3, \"minPoolCost\": 340000000, \"decentralisationParam\": 1.0, \"maxBlockBodySize\": 65536, \"maxBlockHeaderSize\": 1100, \"maxTxSize\": 16384, \"tau\": 0.2, \"rho\": 3.0e-3, \"poolDeposit\": 500000000, \"keyDeposit\": 2000000, \"minFeeB\": 155381, \"minFeeA\": 44, \"minUTxOValue\": 1000000, \"extraEntropy\": { \"tag\": \"NeutralNonce\" }, \"eMax\": 18 }\nThe meaning of the fields is:\nprotocolVersion\": { \"major\": 2, \"minor\": 2 }\n{ \"tag\": \"NeutralNonce\" }\nThe initial non-updatable protocol parameters are given below (in JSON format):\n\"activeSlotsCoeff\": 0.05, ... \"genDelegs\": { \"ad5463153dc3d24b9ff133e46136028bdc1edbb897f5a7cf1b37950c\": { \"delegate\": \"d9e5c76ad5ee778960804094a389f0b546b5c2b140a62f8ec43ea54d\", \"vrf\": \"64fa87e8b29a5b7bfbd6795677e3e878c505bc4a3649485d366b50abadec92d7\" }, ... } }, \"updateQuorum\": 5, \"networkId\": \"Mainnet\", \"initialFunds\": {}, \"maxLovelaceSupply\": 45000000000000000e, \"networkMagic\": 764824073, \"epochLength\": 432000, \"systemStart\": \"2017-09-23T21:44:51Z\", \"slotsPerKESPeriod\": 129600, \"slotLength\": 1, \"maxKESEvolutions\": 62, \"securityParam\": 2160 }\n\"activeSlotsCoeff\": 0.05, ... \"genDelegs\": { \"ad5463153dc3d24b9ff133e46136028bdc1edbb897f5a7cf1b37950c\": { \"delegate\": \"d9e5c76ad5ee778960804094a389f0b546b5c2b140a62f8ec43ea54d\", \"vrf\": \"64fa87e8b29a5b7bfbd6795677e3e878c505bc4a3649485d366b50abadec92d7\" }, ... } }, \"updateQuorum\": 5, \"networkId\": \"Mainnet\", \"initialFunds\": {}, \"maxLovelaceSupply\": 45000000000000000e, \"networkMagic\": 764824073, \"epochLength\": 432000, \"systemStart\": \"2017-09-23T21:44:51Z\", \"slotsPerKESPeriod\": 129600, \"slotLength\": 1, \"maxKESEvolutions\": 62, \"securityParam\": 2160 }\nThe meaning of the fields is:\nThe original protocol parameters are given in the Byron genesis file.

In the interim, the CIP process will be used.\nChanges to the parameters need to be signalled to the community well in advance, so that they can take appropriate action. For the most significant parameters, a minimum of 4-6 weeks elapsed time between announcement and enactment is appropriate. This period must be included in the CIP. Announcements will be made as soon as practical after the conclusion of the vote.\nProtocol parameter changes must be submitted and endorsed within the first 24 hours of the epoch before they are required to come into effect. For example, a change that is intended for epoch 300 must be submitted and endorsed in the first 24 hours of epoch 299. Once a change has been submitted and endorsed by a sufficient quorum of keyholders (currently 5 of the 7 genesis keys), it cannot be revoked.\nOnce a protocol parameter change has been announced, it can only be overridden through the voting process (CIP, Voltaire etc.). Any vote must be completed before the start of the epoch in which the change is to be submitted.\nFollowing the Shelley hard fork event, the decentralisationParam parameter has been gradually decreased from 1.0 to 0.3, with the goal of ultimately decreasing it to 0 (at which point it can be removed entirely as an updatable parameter). This has gradually reduced the impact of the federated block producing nodes, so ensuring that the network moves to become a distributed collection of increasingly decentralised stake pools. The parameter was frozen at 0.32 between epochs 234 and 240. The nOpt parameter was changed from 150 to 500 in epoch 234.\ndecentralisationParam\n1.0\n0.3\n0\n0.32\nnOpt\n150\n500\nThe Allegra Hard Fork Event on 2020-12-16 (epoch 236) introduced token locking capabilities plus some other small changes to the protocol.

This parameter choice was deliberately conservative, in order to avoid throttling rewards in the initial stages of the Cardano mainnet, and to support a wide range of possible stake pool operator (professional, amateur, self, etc.). Some parameter choices (systemStart, securityParam) were required to be backwards compatible with the Byron chain.\nsystemStart\nsecurityParam\nThe key parameters that govern the behaviour of the system are nOpt, a0, decentralisationParam and minPoolCost. Changes to these parameters need to be considered as a package -- there can be unintended consequences when changing a single parameter in isolation.\nnOpt\na0\ndecentralisationParam\nminPoolCost\nIt is expected that the following changes to these parameters are likely in the near to medium term:\nnOpt\na0\nminPoolCost\ndecentralisationParam\nFurther adjustments are likely to be required to tune the system as it evolves.\nFour parameters govern the economics of the system: tau, rho, minFeeA and minFeeB. The first two concern the rate of rewards that are provided to stake pools, delegators and the treasury. The others concern transaction costs.\ntau\nrho\nminFeeA\nminFeeB\nThree parameters govern block and transaction sizes: maxBlockBodySize, maxBlockHeaderSize, maxTxSize. Their settings have been chosen to ensure the required levels of functionality, within constrained resource restrictions (including long-term blockchain size and real-time worldwide exchange of blocks). Changes to these parameters may impact functionality, network reliability and performance.\nmaxBlockBodySize\nmaxBlockHeaderSize\nmaxTxSize\nThis CIP describes the initial set of protocol parameters and the changes to date, so backwards compatibility is not an issue. Future proposals may change any or all of these parameters. A change to the major protocol version indicates a major change in the node software. Such a change may involve adding/removing parameters or changing their semantics/formats. In contrast, minor protocol changes are used to ensure key software updates without changing the meaning of any protocol parameters.\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

URI schemes would enable users to easily make payments by simply clicking links on webpages or scanning QR Codes.\nCentralised sources of information have led a growing amount of stake to be disproportionately assigned to pools pushed near & beyond the saturation point.\nStake pool URIs will provide an additional means for small pools to acquire delegation and maintain stability, supporting diversity and possibly fault-tolerance in the Cardano network through a more even distribution of stake.\nInterfaces that connect delegators with pools beyond the highly contested top choices of the in-wallet ranking algorithms are important to avoid saturation and maintain decentralization.\nLarger pools and collectives can also use these URIs to link to, and spread delegation between, a family of pools they own to avoid any one of their pools becoming saturated.\nPool links allow for interfaces to initiate delegation transactions without requiring any code modifications to the wallets themselves.\nURIs for weighted stake pool lists provide alternatives to using a JSON file to implement delegation portfolios in a way that may better suit certain platforms, applications, or social contexts.\nThe core implementation should follow the BIP-21 standard (with bitcoin: replaced with web+cardano:)\nbitcoin:\nweb+cardano:\nExamples:\n<a href=\"web+cardano:Ae2tdPwUPEZ76BjmWDTS7poTekAvNqBjgfthF92pSLSDVpRVnLP7meaFhVd\">Donate</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://stake?c94e6fe1123bf111b77b57994bcd836af8ba2b3aa72cfcefbec2d3d4\">Stake with us</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://stake?POOL1=3.14159&POOL2=2.71828\">Split between our 2 related pools</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://stake?COSD\">Choose our least saturated pool</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.hosky.io&code=consensus2023\">Claim $HOSKY</a>\n<a href=\"web+cardano:Ae2tdPwUPEZ76BjmWDTS7poTekAvNqBjgfthF92pSLSDVpRVnLP7meaFhVd\">Donate</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://stake?c94e6fe1123bf111b77b57994bcd836af8ba2b3aa72cfcefbec2d3d4\">Stake with us</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://stake?POOL1=3.14159&POOL2=2.71828\">Split between our 2 related pools</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://stake?COSD\">Choose our least saturated pool</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.hosky.io&code=consensus2023\">Claim $HOSKY</a>\nThe protocol term (e.g. //stake) is called the authority as defined in Wikipedia Uniform Resource Identifier Syntax.\n//stake\ncardano: is chosen over ada: because other projects that implement this standard tend to take the project name over the currency name (this makes sense if we consider this protocol as a generic way for interacting with the blockchain through wallets and dApps - as opposed to a simple payment system).\ncardano:\nada:\nDepending on the protocol registration method (see Rationale), browsers generally enforce a web+ or ext+ prefix for non-whitelisted protocols (note: bitcoin: was whitelisted; see registerProtocolHandler Permitted schemes).

When the user has multiple wallets, the wallet UI must select which wallet(s) the user will be delegating from.\nIf, during a wallet or other application's development process, it is still only able to support single pool links, these parameters in the URI query string should (by preference of the wallet UI designers) either be ignored or generate a warning message, to avoid leading the user to believe they are implementing a currently unsupported but perhaps popularly referenced multi-pool delegation list:\nAn ABNF grammar should be specified and explained similarly for each CIP that defines a new Cardano URI authority by explicitly defining the terms authority and query as for the \"Stake pool\" case above.\nauthority\nquery\nproportion\n1\nAn alternative solution to the original problem described above is to use standard URL links in combination with a routing backend system. The routing system is used to redirect to the app's URI. The advantage of this scheme is that it allows to provide a fallback mechanism to handle the case when no application implementing the protocol is installed (for instance, by redirecting to the App Store or Google Play). This is the approach behind iOS Universal Links and Android App Links. In general, it provides a better user experience but requires a centralized system which makes it unsuitable for as a multi-app standard.\nFor background, see\nBIP-21 is limited to only features Bitcoin supports. A similar feature for Ethereum would, for example, also support gas as an extra parameter. BIP-21 is easily extensible but we have to take precaution to avoid different wallets having different implementations of these features as they become available on Cardano. To get an idea of some extra features that could be added, consider this (still under discussion) proposal for Ethereum: EIP-681\nURIs facilitate the \"social element\" of delegated staking and pool promotion through a socially familiar, easily accessible, and less centralised convention for sharing stake pool references and potential delegation portfolios without having to construct or host a JSON file.\nThe processing of a JSON file delivered by a web server will depend highly on a user's platform and might not even be seen by the wallet application at all. With a properly associated web+cardano: protocol, developers and users have another option available in case JSON files are not delivered properly to the wallet application.\nweb+cardano:\nFor a CIP based on this principle, see CIP-0017.\nEncourage wallet and dApp developers to support all currently defined URI protocols, keeping in mind these are each likely to be considered separately:\nEducation and advocacy about these standards should be done by:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This specification defines a user-facing asset fingerprint as a bech32-encoded blake2b-160 digest of the concatenation of the policy id and the asset name.\nThe Mary era of Cardano introduces the support for native assets. On the blockchain, native assets are uniquely identified by both their so-called policy id and asset name. Neither the policy id nor the asset name are intended to be human-readable data.\nOn the one hand, the policy id is a hash digest of either a monetary script or a Plutus script. On the other hand, the asset name is an arbitrary bytestring of up to 32 bytes (which does not necessarily decode to a valid UTF-8 sequence). In addition, it is possible for an asset to have an empty asset name, or, for assets to have identical asset names under different policies.\nBecause assets are manipulated in several user-facing features on desktop and via hardware applications, it is useful to come up with a short(er) and human-readable identifier for assets that user can recognize and refer to when talking about assets. We call such an identifier an asset fingerprint.\nWe define the asset fingerprint in pseudo-code as:\nassetFingerprint := encodeBech32 ( datapart = hash ( algorithm = 'blake2b' , digest-length = 20 , message = policyId | assetName ) , humanReadablePart = 'asset' )\nassetFingerprint := encodeBech32 ( datapart = hash ( algorithm = 'blake2b' , digest-length = 20 , message = policyId | assetName ) , humanReadablePart = 'asset' )\nwhere | designates the concatenation of two byte strings.

It must therefore include both the policy id and the asset name.\nUsing a hash gives us asset id of a same deterministic length which is short enough to display reasonably well on small screens.\nWe use bech32 as a user-facing encoding since it is both user-friendly and quite common within the Cardano eco-system (e.g. addresses, pool ids, keys).\nWith a 160-bit digest, an attacker needs at least 2 80 operations to find a collision. Although 2 80 operations is relatively low (it remains expansive but doable for an attacker), it is considered safe within the context of an asset fingerprint as a mean of user verification within a particular wallet. An attacker may obtain advantage if users can be persuaded that a certain asset is in reality another (which implies to find a collision, and make both assets at the reach of the user).\nWe recommend however that in addition to the asset fingerprint, applications also show whenever possible a visual checksum calculated from the policy id and the asset name as specified in CIP-YET-TO-COME. Such generated images, which are designed to be unique and easy to distinguish, in combination with a readable asset fingerprint gives strong verification means to end users.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This CIP details a transaction metadata format, used by Cardano's Project Catalyst for voter registrations.\nProject Catalyst uses a sidechain for it's voting system. One of the desirable properties of this sidechain is that even if its' safety is compromised, it doesn't cause a loss of funds on Cardano mainnet. To achieve this, instead of using Cardano wallets' recovery phrase on the sidechain, we introduce the \"voting key\".\nHowever, since Catalyst uses stake-based voting, a user needs to associate their mainnet Ada to their voting key. This can be achieved through a voter registration transaction.\nWe therefore need a voter registration transaction that serves three purposes:\nA voting key is simply an ED25519 key. How this key is created is up to the wallet, although it is not recommended that the wallet derives this key deterministicly from a mnemonic used on Cardano.\nA Catalyst registration transaction is a regular Cardano transaction with a specific transaction metadata associated with it.\nNotably, there should be four entries inside the metadata map:\nVoting registration example:\n61284: { // voting_key - CBOR byte array 1: \"0xa6a3c0447aeb9cc54cf6422ba32b294e5e1c3ef6d782f2acff4a70694c4d1663\", // stake_pub - CBOR byte array 2: \"0xad4b948699193634a39dd56f779a2951a24779ad52aa7916f6912b8ec4702cee\", // reward_address - CBOR byte array 3: \"0x00588e8e1d18cba576a4d35758069fe94e53f638b6faf7c07b8abd2bc5c5cdee47b60edc7772855324c85033c638364214cbfc6627889f81c4\", // nonce 4: 5479467 }\n61284: { // voting_key - CBOR byte array 1: \"0xa6a3c0447aeb9cc54cf6422ba32b294e5e1c3ef6d782f2acff4a70694c4d1663\", // stake_pub - CBOR byte array 2: \"0xad4b948699193634a39dd56f779a2951a24779ad52aa7916f6912b8ec4702cee\", // reward_address - CBOR byte array 3: \"0x00588e8e1d18cba576a4d35758069fe94e53f638b6faf7c07b8abd2bc5c5cdee47b60edc7772855324c85033c638364214cbfc6627889f81c4\", // nonce 4: 5479467 }\nThe entries under keys 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the Catalyst voting key, the staking key on the Cardano network, the address to receive rewards, and a nonce, respectively. A registration with these metadata will be considered valid if the following conditions hold:\nTo produce the signature field, the CBOR representation of a map containing a single entry with key 61284 and the registration metadata map in the format above is formed, designated here as sign_data. This data is signed with the staking key as follows: first, the blake2b-256 hash of sign_data is obtained. This hash is then signed using the Ed25519 signature algorithm. The signature metadata entry is added to the transaction under key 61285 as a CBOR map with a single entry that consists of the integer key 1 and signature as obtained above as the byte array value.\n61284\nsign_data\nsign_data\nSignature example:\n61285: { // signature - ED25119 signature CBOR byte array 1: \"0x8b508822ac89bacb1f9c3a3ef0dc62fd72a0bd3849e2381b17272b68a8f52ea8240dcc855f2264db29a8512bfcd522ab69b982cb011e5f43d0154e72f505f007\" }\n61285: { // signature - ED25119 signature CBOR byte array 1: \"0x8b508822ac89bacb1f9c3a3ef0dc62fd72a0bd3849e2381b17272b68a8f52ea8240dcc855f2264db29a8512bfcd522ab69b982cb011e5f43d0154e72f505f007\" }\nThis CIP is not to be versioned using a traditional scheme, rather if any large technical changes require a new proposal to replace this one.

This has been deferred to a future revision of the protocol.\nregistration_signature\nstaking_pub_key\nkey_registration\nThe described metadata format allows for the association of a voting key with a stake credential on a Cardano network.\nCardano uses the UTxO model so to completely associate a wallet's balance with a voting key (i.e. including enterprise addresses), we would need to associate every payment key to a voting key individually. Although there are attempts at this (see CIP-0008), the resulting data structure is a little excessive for on-chain metadata (which we want to keep small).\nGiven the above, we choose to only associate staking keys with voting keys. Since most Cardano wallets only use base addresses for Shelley wallet types, in most cases this should perfectly match the user's wallet.\nA future change of the Catalyst system may make use of a time-lock script to commit ADA on the mainnet for the duration of a voting period. The voter registration metadata in this method will not need an association with the staking key. Therefore, the staking_pub_key map entry and the registration_signature payload with key 61285 will no longer be required.\nstaking_pub_key\nregistration_signature\n61285\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This document details a common format for sharing Cardano delegation portfolio across various tools and wallets.\nStakeholders have indicated the desire to split their stake in various sizes and delegate to n pools from a single wallet/mnemonic. Albeit there are no monetary incentive for users to do this, the desire to drive decentralisation is sufficiently prevalent to justify it. Furthermore, stakeholders want to introduce a certain social element to this activity by sharing their delegation portfolio with other stakeholders. This specification should help to standardize the representation of portfolios across tools for more interoperability.\nWe'll use JSON as a data format for it is commonly used and supported across many programming languages, and is also relatively readable on itself. Portfolios should abide by the JSON schema given in appendix.\nAt minima, a portfolio should cover a list of delegation choices (pools and weights) and have a human-readable name for easier identification.\nFor each pool, we demand a weight which can capture a certain stake proportion within the portfolio. The value is an integer, and relative to other weights in the portfolio. For example, a portfolio with two pools and respective weights of 1 and 2 means that we expect users to assign twice more stake to the second pool than the first. Fundamentally, this means that for every 3 Ada, 1 Ada should go to the first pool, and 2 Ada should go to the second. Note that this is equivalent to having weights of 10/20 or 14 / 28. Weights are ultimately interpreted as fractions.\nweight\n1\n2\n10\n20\n14\n28\nPortfolios which treat all stake pools equally should use the same weight (e.g. 1) for each pool.\n1\n{ \"name\": \"Metal 🤘\" , \"description\": \"Pools supporting Metal music across the world.\" , \"pools\": [ { \"id\": \"d59123f4dce7c62fa74bd37a759c7ba665dbabeb28f08b4e5d4802ca\" , \"name\": \"Dark Tranquility\" , \"ticker\": \"DARK\" , \"weight\": 42 } , { \"id\": \"5f3833027fe8c8d63bc5e75960d9a22df52e41bdf62af5b689663c50\" , \"ticker\": \"NITRO\" , \"weight\": 14 } , { \"id\": \"a16abb03d87b86f30bb743aad2e2504b126286fe744d3d2f6a0b4aec\" , \"name\": \"Loudness\" , \"ticker\": \"LOUD\" , \"weight\": 37 } , { \"id\": \"9f9bdee3e053e3102815b778db5ef8d55393f7ae83b36f906f4c3a47\" , \"weight\": 25 } ] }\n{ \"name\": \"Metal 🤘\" , \"description\": \"Pools supporting Metal music across the world.\" , \"pools\": [ { \"id\": \"d59123f4dce7c62fa74bd37a759c7ba665dbabeb28f08b4e5d4802ca\" , \"name\": \"Dark Tranquility\" , \"ticker\": \"DARK\" , \"weight\": 42 } , { \"id\": \"5f3833027fe8c8d63bc5e75960d9a22df52e41bdf62af5b689663c50\" , \"ticker\": \"NITRO\" , \"weight\": 14 } , { \"id\": \"a16abb03d87b86f30bb743aad2e2504b126286fe744d3d2f6a0b4aec\" , \"name\": \"Loudness\" , \"ticker\": \"LOUD\" , \"weight\": 37 } , { \"id\": \"9f9bdee3e053e3102815b778db5ef8d55393f7ae83b36f906f4c3a47\" , \"weight\": 25 } ] }\nJSON is widely used, widely supported and quite lightweight. Makes for a reasonable choice of data format.\nUsing JSON schema for validation is quite common when dealing with JSON and it's usually sufficiently precise to enable good interoperability.\nThe portfolio should only capture information that are not subject to radical change. That is, stake pools parameters like pledge or fees are excluded since they can be changed fairly easily using on-chain certificate updates.\nThe JSON schema doesn't enforce any additionalProperties: false for neither the top-level object definition nor each stake pool objects. This allows for open extension of the objects with custom fields at the discretion of applications implementing this standard. The semantic of well-known properties specified in this document is however fixed.\nadditionalProperties: false\nSince the portfolio format isn't immediately user-facing, we favor base16 over bech32 for the pool id's encoding for there's better support and tooling for the former.\nThe format used by Adafolio share a lot of similarities with the proposed format in this CIP. In order to power its frontend user interface, Adafolio contains however several fields which we consider too volatile and unnecessary to the definition of a portfolio. This doesn't preclude the format used by Adafolio as a valid portfolio format (see also point (4). in the rationale above).\nThe only point of incompatibility regards the pool_id field (in Adafolio) vs the id field (in this proposal) which we deem more consistent with regards to other field.\npool_id\nid\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This document describes how to evolve sequential wallets from Cardano to support multiple stake keys. This proposal is an extension of CIP-1852 and CIP-0011.\nCardano wallets originally approached stake delegation by considering a single stake key per wallet. While this was beneficial in terms of ease of implementation and simplicity of reasoning, this is unsuitable for many users with large stakes. Indeed, the inability to split out the stake into multiple pools often leads to over-saturation of existing pools in case of delegation. The only workaround so far requires users to split their funds into multiple accounts and manage them independently. This can be quite cumbersome for a sufficiently large number of accounts.\nEven for smaller actors, it can be interesting to delegate to multiple pools to limit risks. Pools may underperform or simply change their parameters from a day to another (for which wallets still do not warn users about). Delegating to more pools can reduce the impact of pool failure (for one or more epochs) or unattended changes in pool fees. It may as well be a matter of choice if users do want to delegate to several independent entities for various other reasons.\nAnother concern regards privacy leaks coming with the existing wallet scheme. Since the same stake key is associated with every single address of the wallet, it creates a kind of watermark that allows for tracing all funds belonging to the same wallet very easily (it suffices to look at the stake part of addresses). By allowing the wallet to hold multiple stake keys, rotating through them when creating changes does make the traceability a bit harder. One could imagine using a hundred stake keys delegated to the same pool.\nThe restriction from CIP-0011 regarding the derivation index reserved for stake key is rendered obsolete by this specification. That is, one is allowed to derive indexes beyond the first one (index = 0) to effectively administrate multi-stake keys accounts. The creation of new stake keys is however tightly coupled to the registration of associated stake keys to allow wallet software to automatically discover stake keys on-chain. In this design, stake key indexes form at all time a contiguous sequence with no gap.\nWe introduce the concept of UTxO stake key pointer to reliably keep track of stake keys on the blockchain. The gist is to require that every key registration and/or deregistration consume and create a special UTxO which in itself is pointing to the next available stake key of the wallet. Such pointer allows piggybacking on the existing UTxO structure to cope with concurrency issues and rollbacks that are inherent to a distributed system such as Cardano. Plus, this mechanism only demands a low overhead for wallet software and may be recognized as a special spending pattern by hardware devices.\nIn more details, we require that beyond the first stake key (index = 0), all registrations must satisfy the following rules:\nminUTxOValue\nNote The minUTxOValue is fixed by the protocol. It is defined as part of the Shelley genesis and can be updated via on-chain protocol updates. At the moment, this equals 1 Ada on the mainnet.\nminUTxOValue\nFor example, a wallet that has already registered stake keys 0, 1 and 2 have a UTxO for which the payment part is a hash of the stake key at index=3. If the wallet wants to register two new stake keys at index 3 and 4, it'll do so in a single transaction, by consuming the pointer UTxO and by creating a new one for which the payment part would be a hash of the stake key at index=5.\nNote that this only requires two signatures from stake keys at indexes 3 and 4.\nKey de-registrations work symmetrically and require that:\nminUtxOValue\nAs stated in the introduction, this proposal is built on top of CIP-0011 such that backward compatibility is preserved when a single key is used. In fact, The management of the first stake key at index 0 remains unchanged and does not require any pointer. This preserves backward compatibility with the existing design for a single stake key wallet and offers a design that can be implemented on top, retro-actively.\nNevertheless, we do assume that existing wallets following CIP-0011 are already fully capable of discovering addresses using stake keys not belonging to the wallet. Some may even report them as mangled.\nNote An address is said mangled when it has a stake part, and the stake part isn't recognized as belonging to its associated wallet. That is, the payment part and the stake part appear to come from two different sources. This could be the case if the address has been purposely constructed in such a way (because the stake rights and funds are managed by separate entities), or because the stake part refers to a key hash which is no longer known of the wallet (because the associated key registration was rolled back).\nAs a result, this extension would not incapacitate existing wallets since the payment ownership is left untouched. However, wallets not supporting the extension may display addresses delegated to keys beyond the first one as mangled and may also fail to report rewards correctly across multiple keys.\nWe deem this to be an acceptable and fairly minor consequence but encourage existing software to raise awareness about this behaviour.\nCarrying an extra UTxO pointer makes it possible to not worry (too much) about concurrency issues and problems coming with either, multiple instances of the wallet (like many users do between a mobile and desktop wallet) or the usual rollbacks which may otherwise create gaps in the indexes. By forcing all registration (resp. deregistration) transactions to be chained together, we also enforce that any rollbacks do maintain consistency of the index state: if any intermediate transaction is rolled back, then transactions they depend on are also rolled back.\nThe first registration induces an extra cost for the end-user for the wallet needs to create a new UTxO with a minimum value. That UTxO is however passed from registration to registration afterwards without any extra cost. It can also be fully refunded upon de-registering the last stake key. So in practice, it works very much like a key deposit.\nWe do not allow mixing up key registration and key deregistration as part of the same transaction for it makes the calculation of the pointer trickier for wallet processing transactions. A single transaction either move the pointer up or down.\nThere's in principle nothing preventing someone from sending money to the special key-registration tracking address. Wallets should however only keep track of UTxOs created as part of transactions that register stake keys (and have therefore been authorized by the wallet itself). Applications are however encouraged to collect any funds sent to them in an ad-hoc manner on such keys.\nUpdate this proposal to account for the Conway Ledger era, which brings new types of certificates for registering stake keys.\nDevelop the proposed Reference Implementation as suggested when this CIP was originally published (see Discussion link in header for history).\nContact wallet and dApp representatives in the community to develop and maintain interest in their support for this specification.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This specification describes the structure of addresses in Cardano, covering both addresses introduced in the Shelley era and the legacy format from the Byron era.\nDocument design choices for posterity. Most applications interacting with the Cardano blockchain will likely not have any need for this level of details, however, some might. This CIP is meant to capture this knowledge.\nIn Cardano, an address is a sequence of bytes that conforms to a particular format, which we describe below.\nHowever, users will typically come into contact with addresses only after these addresses have been encoded into sequences of human-readable characters. In Cardano, the Bech32 and Base58 encodings are used to encode addresses, as opposed to standard hexadecimal notation (Base16, example 0x8A7B). These encoded sequence of characters have to be distinguished from the byte sequences that they encode, but lay users will (and should) perceive the encoded form as \"the\" address.\n0x8A7B\nBy convention, Shelley and stake addresses are encoded using Bech32, with the exception that Cardano does not impose a length limit on the sequence of characters. The human-readable prefixes are defined in CIP-0005; the most common prefix is addr, representing an address on mainnet. Bech32 is the preferred encoding, as its built-in error detection may protect users against accidental misspellings or truncations.\naddr\nAgain by convention, Byron addresses are encoded in Base58.\nHistorically, Byron addresses were introduced before the design of Bech32, which solves various issues of the Base58 encoding format (see Bech32's motivation for more detail). Byron addresses were however kept as Base58 to easily distinguish them from new addresses introduced in Shelley, massively making use of Bech32 for encoding small binary objects.\nCave: In principle, it is possible for a Shelley address to be encoded in Base58 and a Byron address to be encoded in Bech32 (without length limit). However, implementations are encouraged to reject addresses that were encoded against convention, as this helps with the goal that lay users only encounter a single, canonical version of every address.\nExamples of different addresses encoded in different eras:\n37btjrVyb4KDXBNC4haBVPCrro8AQPHwvCMp3RFhhSVWwfFmZ6wwzSK6JK1hY6wHNmtrpTf1kdbva8TCneM2YsiXT7mrzT21EacHnPpz5YyUdj64na\naddr1vpu5vlrf4xkxv2qpwngf6cjhtw542ayty80v8dyr49rf5eg0yu80w\nstake1vpu5vlrf4xkxv2qpwngf6cjhtw542ayty80v8dyr49rf5egfu2p0u\nIn Cardano, the sequence of bytes (after decoding with Bech32 or Base58) that represents an address comprises two parts, a one-byte header and a payload of several bytes. Depending on the header, the interpretation and length of the payload varies.\nIn the header-byte, bits [7;4] indicate the type of addresses being used; we'll call these four bits the header type. The remaining four bits [3;0] are either unused or refer to what we'll call the network tag. There are currently 11 types of addresses in Cardano which we'll divide into three categories: Shelley addresses, stake addresses, and Byron addresses.\n1 byte variable length <------> <-------------------> ┌────────┬─────────────────────┐ │ header │ payload │ └────────┴─────────────────────┘ 🔎 ╎ 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ╎ ┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐ ╰╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌ │t│t│t│t│n│n│n│n│ └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘\n1 byte variable length <------> <-------------------> ┌────────┬─────────────────────┐ │ header │ payload │ └────────┴─────────────────────┘ 🔎 ╎ 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ╎ ┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐ ╰╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌ │t│t│t│t│n│n│n│n│ └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘\nSee also the more detailed ABNF grammar in annex.\nExcept for Byron addresses (type 8 = 1000), the second half of the header (bits [3;0]) refers to the network tag which can have the following values and semantics. Other values of the network tag are currently reserved for future network types. In the case of Byron addresses, bits [3;0] have a completely separate definition detailed in the section below.\n1000\n. . . . n n n n\n....0000\n....0001\nThere are currently 8 types of Shelley addresses summarized in the table below:\nt t t t . . . .\n0000....\nPaymentKeyHash\nStakeKeyHash\n0001....\nScriptHash\nStakeKeyHash\n0010....\nPaymentKeyHash\nScriptHash\n0011....\nScriptHash\nScriptHash\n0100....\nPaymentKeyHash\nPointer\n0101....\nScriptHash\nPointer\n0110....\nPaymentKeyHash\n0111....\nScriptHash\nPaymentKeyHash and StakeKeyHash refer to blake2b-224 hash digests of Ed25519 verification keys. How keys are obtained is out of the scope of this specification. Interested readers may look at CIP-1852 for more details.\nPaymentKeyHash\nStakeKeyHash\nblake2b-224\nScriptHash refer to blake2b-224 hash digests of serialized monetary scripts. How scripts are constructed and serialized is out of the scope of this specification.\nScriptHash\nblake2b-224\nPointer is detailed in the section below.\nPointer\nFundamentally, the first part of a Shelley address indicates the ownership of the funds associated with the address. We call it the payment part. Whoever owns the payment parts owns any funds at the address. As a matter of fact, in order to spend from an address, one must provide a witness attesting that the address can be spent. In the case of a PaymentKeyHash, it means providing a signature of the transaction body made with the signing key corresponding to the hashed public key (as well as the public key itself for verification). For monetary scripts, it means being able to provide the source script and meet the necessary conditions to validate the script.\nPaymentKeyHash\nThe second part of a Shelley address indicates the owner of the stake rights associated with the address. We call it the delegation part. Whoever owns the delegation parts owns the stake rights of any funds associated with the address. In most scenarios, the payment part and the delegation part are owned by the same party. Yet it is possible to construct addresses where both parts are owned and managed by separate entities. We call such addresses mangled addresses or hybrid addresses.\nSome addresses (types 6 and 7) carry no delegation part whatsoever. Their associated stake can't be delegated. They can be used by parties who want to prove that they are not delegating funds which is typically the case for custodial businesses managing funds on the behalf of other stakeholders. Delegation parts can also be defined in terms of on-chain pointers.\nNote From the Conway ledger era, new pointer addresses cannot be added to Mainnet.\nIn an address, a chain pointer refers to a point of the chain containing a stake key registration certificate. A point is identified by 3 coordinates:\nThese coordinates form a concise way of referring to a stake key (typically half the size of a stake key hash). They are serialized as three variable-length positive numbers following the ABNF grammar here below:\nPOINTER = VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; slot number | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; transaction index | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; certificate index VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT = (%b1 | UINT7 | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT) / (%b0 | UINT7) UINT7 = 7BIT\nPOINTER = VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; slot number | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; transaction index | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; certificate index VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT = (%b1 | UINT7 | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT) / (%b0 | UINT7) UINT7 = 7BIT\nLike Shelley addresses, stake addresses (also known as reward addresses) start with a single header byte identifying their type and the network, followed by 28 bytes of payload identifying either a stake key hash or a script hash.\nt t t t . . . .\n1110....\nStakeKeyHash\n1111....\nScriptHash\nStakeKeyHash refers to blake2b-224 hash digests of Ed25519 verification keys. How keys are obtained is out of the scope of this specification. Interested readers may look at CIP-1852 for more details.\nStakeKeyHash\nblake2b-224\nScriptHash refers to blake2b-224 hash digests of serialized monetary scripts. How scripts are constructed and serialized is out of the scope of this specification.\nScriptHash\nblake2b-224\nBefore diving in, please acknowledge that a lot of the supported capabilities of Byron addresses have remained largely unused. The initial design showed important trade-offs and rendered it unpractical to sustain the long-term goals of the network. A new format was created when introducing Shelley and Byron addresses were kept only for backward compatibility. Byron addresses are also sometimes called bootstrap addresses.\nLike many other objects on the Cardano blockchain yet unlike Shelley addresses, Byron addresses are CBOR-encoded binary objects. Conveniently enough, the first 4 bits of their first byte are always equal to 1000.... which allows us to land back on our feet w.r.t to the address type. Their internal structure is however vastly different and a bit unusual.\n1000....\n┌────────┬──────────────┬────────┐ │ root │ attributes │ type │ └────────┴──────────────┴────────┘ ╎ ╎ ╎ ╎ ╎ ╰╌╌ Standard ╎ ╎ ╰╌╌ Redeem ╎ ╎ ╎ ╰╌╌ Derivation Path ╎ ╰╌╌ Network Tag ╎ ╎ ┌────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┐ ╰╌╌╌╌ double-hash ( │ type │ spending data │ attributes │ ) └────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┘ ╎ ╰╌╌ Verification Key ╰╌╌ Redemption Key\n┌────────┬──────────────┬────────┐ │ root │ attributes │ type │ └────────┴──────────────┴────────┘ ╎ ╎ ╎ ╎ ╎ ╰╌╌ Standard ╎ ╎ ╰╌╌ Redeem ╎ ╎ ╎ ╰╌╌ Derivation Path ╎ ╰╌╌ Network Tag ╎ ╎ ┌────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┐ ╰╌╌╌╌ double-hash ( │ type │ spending data │ attributes │ ) └────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┘ ╎ ╰╌╌ Verification Key ╰╌╌ Redemption Key\nThe address root uniquely identifies the address and is a double-hash digest (SHA3-256, and then Blake2b-224) of the address type, spending data, and attributes.\nroot\nThen comes the address attributes which are both optional. The network tag is present only on test networks and contains an identifier that is used for network discrimination. The derivation path (detailed below) was used by legacy so-called random wallets in the early days of Cardano and its usage was abandoned with the introduction of Yoroi and so-called Icarus addresses.\nFinally, the address type allows for distinguishing different sub-types of Byron addresses. Redeem addresses are used inside the Byron genesis configuration and were given to early investors who helped to fund the project.\nA full and more detailed CDDL specification of Byron addresses is given in the annex to the CIP.\nHistorically, Cardano wallets have been storing information about the wallet structure directly within the address. This information comes in the form of two derivation indexes (in the sense of child key derivation as defined in BIP-0032) which we call derivation path. To protect the wallet's anonymity, the derivation path is stored encrypted using a ChaCha20/Poly1305 authenticated cipher.\nAll test vectors below use the following payment key, stake key, script and pointer:\naddr_vk1w0l2sr2zgfm26ztc6nl9xy8ghsk5sh6ldwemlpmp9xylzy4dtf7st80zhd\nstake_vk1px4j0r2fk7ux5p23shz8f3y5y2qam7s954rgf3lg5merqcj6aetsft99wu\nscript1cda3khwqv60360rp5m7akt50m6ttapacs8rqhn5w342z7r35m37\n(2498243, 27, 3)\nmainnet: type-00: addr1qx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer3n0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgse35a3x type-01: addr1z8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gten0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgs9yc0hh type-02: addr1yx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzerkr0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shs2z78ve type-03: addr1x8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gt7r0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shskhj42g type-04: addr1gx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer5pnz75xxcrzqf96k type-05: addr128phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtupnz75xxcrtw79hu type-06: addr1vx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzers66hrl8 type-07: addr1w8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcyjy7wx type-14: stake1uyehkck0lajq8gr28t9uxnuvgcqrc6070x3k9r8048z8y5gh6ffgw type-15: stake178phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcccycj5 testnet: type-00: addr_test1qz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer3n0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgs68faae type-01: addr_test1zrphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gten0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgsxj90mg type-02: addr_test1yz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzerkr0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shsf5r8qx type-03: addr_test1xrphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gt7r0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shs4p04xh type-04: addr_test1gz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer5pnz75xxcrdw5vky type-05: addr_test12rphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtupnz75xxcryqrvmw type-06: addr_test1vz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzerspjrlsz type-07: addr_test1wrphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcl6szpr type-14: stake_test1uqehkck0lajq8gr28t9uxnuvgcqrc6070x3k9r8048z8y5gssrtvn type-15: stake_test17rphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcljw6kf\nmainnet: type-00: addr1qx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer3n0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgse35a3x type-01: addr1z8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gten0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgs9yc0hh type-02: addr1yx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzerkr0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shs2z78ve type-03: addr1x8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gt7r0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shskhj42g type-04: addr1gx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer5pnz75xxcrzqf96k type-05: addr128phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtupnz75xxcrtw79hu type-06: addr1vx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzers66hrl8 type-07: addr1w8phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcyjy7wx type-14: stake1uyehkck0lajq8gr28t9uxnuvgcqrc6070x3k9r8048z8y5gh6ffgw type-15: stake178phkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcccycj5 testnet: type-00: addr_test1qz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer3n0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgs68faae type-01: addr_test1zrphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gten0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgsxj90mg type-02: addr_test1yz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzerkr0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shsf5r8qx type-03: addr_test1xrphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gt7r0vd4msrxnuwnccdxlhdjar77j6lg0wypcc9uar5d2shs4p04xh type-04: addr_test1gz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer5pnz75xxcrdw5vky type-05: addr_test12rphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtupnz75xxcryqrvmw type-06: addr_test1vz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzerspjrlsz type-07: addr_test1wrphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcl6szpr type-14: stake_test1uqehkck0lajq8gr28t9uxnuvgcqrc6070x3k9r8048z8y5gssrtvn type-15: stake_test17rphkx6acpnf78fuvxn0mkew3l0fd058hzquvz7w36x4gtcljw6kf\nAs stated in Motivation this CIP is provided for informational purposes regarding a single deliberate design.

    "completion": "This describes a basic JSON schema to add messages/comments/memos as transaction metadata by using the metadatum label 674: allowing informational, commerical, or any other text to be included in a transaction on the Cardano blockchain.\nWe have the utilities on the cardano blockchain now since the introduction of the \"allegra-era\". A simple consens about adding messages, comments or memos to transactions is still missing. So the CIP authors came together to form a first implementation of this. It is straight and simple, additional keys and content can be added later. The IOG main wallet Daedalus can now also directly show attached metadata information in the transaction details view. This CIP is the missing link to bring it together.\nDaedalus\nSome of the current Tools/Sites/Explorers that have implemented it already:\nThe specification for the individual strings follow the general design specification for JSON metadata, which is already implemented and in operation on the cardano blockchain. The used metadatum label is \"674\":, this number was choosen because it is the T9 encoding of the string \"msg\". The message content has the key \"msg\": and consists of an array of individual message-strings. The number of theses message-strings must be at least one for a single message, more for multiple messages/lines. Each of theses individual message-strings array entries must be at most 64 bytes when UTF-8 encoded.\n\"674\":\n\"msg\":\n{ \"674\": { \"msg\": [ \"message-string 1\" //Optional: ,\"message-string 2\",\"message-string 3\" ... ] } }\n{ \"674\": { \"msg\": [ \"message-string 1\" //Optional: ,\"message-string 2\",\"message-string 3\" ... ] } }\n{ \"674\": { \"msg\": [ \"This is a comment for the transaction xyz, thank you very much!\" ] } }\n{ \"674\": { \"msg\": [ \"This is a comment for the transaction xyz, thank you very much!\" ] } }\n{ \"674\": { \"msg\": [ \"Invoice-No: 1234567890\", \"Customer-No: 555-1234\", \"P.S.: i will shop again at your store :-)\" ] } }\n{ \"674\": { \"msg\": [ \"Invoice-No: 1234567890\", \"Customer-No: 555-1234\", \"P.S.: i will shop again at your store :-)\" ] } }\nLedger Live is offering a memo field\nDaedalus shows the metadata text (could be improved if CIP is implemented):\nCardanoscan.io, Adastat.net and other tools implemented it already, to show messages along transactions:\neternl.io has added it with a message field on the sending-page, and shows it also on the transactions-page:\nStakePool Operator Scripts: It works on the commandline like any other script of the collection by just adding the \"msg: ...\" parameter to a transaction. This automatically generates the needed metadata.json structure and attaches it to the transaction itself.\nCNTools:\nThis design is simple, so many tools on the cardano blockchain can implement it easily. The array type was choosen to have consistency, no need to switch between a string or an array format, or testing against a string or array format. Updates in the future are possible, like adding a versioning key \"ver\":, adding a key \"utxo\": to provide specific data for every tx-out#idx in the transaction, adding the \"enc\": key like for encrypted messages, making subarrays in the message-strings, etc. But for now, we need a common agreement to provide general messages/comments/memos with this CIP. The starting design war choosen as simple as possible to keep the additional transaction fees as low as possible.\n\"ver\":\n\"utxo\":\n\"enc\":\nWould be a good idea to hide the message/comment/note behind a \"show unmoderated content\" button/drop-down. Like the Metadata display on the Cardano Explorer. Also, it should be displayed as plain-text non-clickable. To enhance security further, URLs could be automatically deleted or hidden from such comments, to not welcome bad actors with phishing attempts. Another solution to start with would be to really limit the character space for display in Wallets, like limiting it to a-zA-z0-9 and a handful of special chars like +-_#()[]: without a . \"/\\ chars, so a domain or html code would not work. Last points are worth for discussions of course, because it would also filter out unicode.\na-zA-z0-9\n+-_#()[]:\n.<>\"/\\\nIt is up to the wallet-/display-/receiver-implementor to parse and check the provided metadata. As for the current state, its not possible to have the same label \"674\" more than once in a cardano transaction. So a check about that can be ignored at the moment. This CIP provides the correct implementation format, the parsing should search for the \"674\" metadata label and the \"msg\" key underneath it. There should also be a check, that the provided data within that \"msg\" key is an array. All other implementations like a missing \"msg\" key, or a single string instead of an array, should be marked by the display-implementor as \"invalid\". Additional keys within the \"674\" label should not affect the parsing of the \"msg\" key. As written above, we will likely see more entries here in the future like a \"version\" key for example, so additional keys should not harm the parsing of the \"msg\" key.\nA transaction message should be considered valid if the following apply:\nIf any of the above is not met, ignore the metadata as a transaction message. Can still be displayed as general metadata to the transaction.\nOptional to consider for the implementer:\nAs per the first two Discussion links:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This CIP describes all the restrictions applicable to Cardano transactions which need to be signed by hardware wallets.\nDue to certain limitations of hardware (abbrev. HW) wallets, especially very small memory and a limited set of data types supported by Ledger, HW wallets are not able to process all valid transactions which are supported by Cardano nodes.\nThe limitations also result in an inability of HW wallets to see the whole transaction at once. Transaction data are streamed into HW wallets in small chunks and they compute a rolling hash of the transaction body which is signed at the end. Consequently, a HW wallet only provides witness signatures, and the transaction body which was signed has to be reconstructed by the client. We thus need a common transaction serialization format which will allow no ambiguity. In addition, the format must define ordering of map keys in such a way that it s possible to check for duplicate keys by HW wallets.\nSeveral of the restrictions also stem from security or UX concerns, e.g. the forbidden combination of pool registration certificates and withdrawals in a single transaction (see reasoning below).\nTo ensure interoperability, SW wallets and other tools working with HW wallets should only use transactions which conform to the following rules.\nCertain transaction elements, described as allowed in this document, might not be supported by some HW wallets. Support also depends on HW wallet firmware or app versions. If transaction signing fails for a transaction which is built according to this specification, make sure to check the documentation of the HW wallet you are using.\nNote: It might take some time for recent Cardano ledger spec changes to be implemented for HW wallets. Thus it might happen that further restrictions might apply on top of the restrictions mentioned in this CIP until the changes are implemented on HW wallets.\nTransactions must be serialized in line with suggestions from Section 3.9 of CBOR specification RFC. In particular:\nSee the RFC for details.\nConway introduced optional 258 tags in certain items that are considered sets semantically but encoded as arrays in CBOR. HW wallets will support this optional encoding, but it must be consistent across the transaction: either there are no tags 258 in sets, or there are such tags everywhere (as described in the CDDL specification).\nThe following transaction body entries must not be included:\n6 : update\n20 : proposal procedures\nHW wallets support at most int64 for signed integers and uint64 for unsigned integers i.e. larger integers are not supported overall. Additionally, any integer value must fit in the appropriate type.\nint64\nuint64\nThe number of the following transaction elements individually must not exceed UINT16_MAX, i.e. 65535:\nUINT16_MAX\nFor voting procedures, it is only allowed to include a single voter with a single voting procedure.\nUnless mentioned otherwise in this CIP, optional empty lists and maps must not be included as part of the transaction body or its elements.\nSince Conway, the CDDL specification is stricter, so many arrays are now treated as non-empty sets, and some maps are required to be non-empty. HW wallets enforce this in many cases.\nA new, \"post Alonzo\", output format has been introduced in the Babbage ledger era which uses a map instead of an array to store the output data. For now, both the \"legacy\" (array) and \"post Alonzo\" (map) output formats are supported by HW wallets but we encourage everyone to migrate to the \"post Alonzo\" format as support for the \"legacy\" output format might be removed in the future. Both formats can be mixed within a single transaction, both in outputs and in the collateral return output.\nOutputs containing no multi-asset tokens must be serialized as a simple tuple, i.e. [address, coin, ?datum_hash] instead of [address, [coin, {}], ?datum_hash].\n[address, coin, ?datum_hash]\n[address, [coin, {}], ?datum_hash]\nIf the data of datum_option is included in an output, it must not be empty. script_ref (reference script) must also not be empty if it is included in an output.\ndata\ndatum_option\nscript_ref\nSince multiassets (policy_id and asset_name) are represented as maps, both need to be sorted in accordance with the specified canonical CBOR format. Also, an output or the mint field must not contain duplicate policy_ids and a policy must not contain duplicate asset_names.\npolicy_id\nasset_name\npolicy_id\nasset_name\nCertificates of the following types are not supported and must not be included:\ngenesis_key_delegation\nmove_instantaneous_rewards_cert\nstake_vote_deleg_cert\nstake_reg_deleg_cert\nvote_reg_deleg_cert\nstake_vote_reg_deleg_cert\nIf a transaction contains a pool registration certificate, then it must not contain:\nIt is allowed to arbitrarily combine other supported certificate types.\nSince withdrawals are represented as a map of reward accounts, withdrawals also need to be sorted in accordance with the specified canonical CBOR format. A transaction must not contain duplicate withdrawals.\nHW wallets do not serialize auxiliary data because of their complex structure. They only include the given auxiliary data hash in the transaction body. The only exception is Catalyst voting registration because it requires a signature computed by the HW wallet.\nIn this exceptional case, auxiliary data must be encoded in their \"tuple\" format:\n[ transaction_metadata: { * transaction_metadatum_label => transaction_metadatum }, auxiliary_scripts: [ * native_script ]]\n[ transaction_metadata: { * transaction_metadatum_label => transaction_metadatum }, auxiliary_scripts: [ * native_script ]]\nThe auxiliary_scripts must be an array of length 0.\nauxiliary_scripts\nAs HW wallets don't return the whole serialized transaction, a common CBOR serialization is needed so that software wallets and other tools interacting with HW wallets are be able to deterministically reproduce the transaction body built and signed by the HW wallet.\nThe specified canonical CBOR format is consistent with how certain other data are serialized (e.g. Plutus script data in Alonzo) and allows the use of standard CBOR libraries out of the box.\nGenerally, HW wallets require that any key hash credential (and withdrawal address too) is given by the derivation path of the key (otherwise the user will not be aware that the key belongs to his wallet). This does not apply to Plutus transactions where HW wallets instead aim for maximum flexibility at the cost of users being potentially misled. (It is very hard to foresee how Plutus script authors would use various transaction elements and any restriction applied by HW wallets might break a use case which is otherwise perfectly sound and safe.)\nWhen signing a transaction, Ledger and Trezor use a transaction signing mode that describes upfront what the intent is (the software wallet is responsible for choosing an appropriate mode). The transaction is then validated according to the mode. There are, in principle, four options:\nThis brief description does not aim to capture the full complexity of signing modes; always verify that transactions you aim to construct are supported by other tools you will rely on (hardware wallets, software wallets, command-line tools like cardano-hw-cli etc.).\ncardano-hw-cli\nAllowing duplicate policy_ids (or asset_names) might lead to inconsistencies between what is displayed to the user and how nodes and other tools might interpret the duplicate keys, i.e. all policies (or asset names) would be shown to the user, but nodes and other tools might eventually interpret only a single one of them.\npolicy_id\nasset_name\nCombining withdrawals and pool registration certificates isn't allowed because both are signed by staking keys by pool owners. If it was allowed to have both in a transaction then the witness provided by a pool owner might inadvertently serve as a witness for a withdrawal for the owner's account.\nSimilarly to multiassets, allowing duplicate withdrawals might lead to inconsistencies between what is displayed to the user and how nodes and other tools might interpret the duplicate keys.\nThe specified auxiliary data format was chosen in order to be compatible with other Cardano tools, which mostly use this serialization format.\nA DRep witness can serve for both certificates and votes at the same time. Unlike with stake keys (where combining pool registration with e.g. withdrawals is forbidden), no restriction is imposed on the combination of certificates and votes. We think that votes and DRep certificates are rare and substantially distinguished parts of a transaction, signed by DRep keys which are likely to only be used by users with deep enough understanding (and, unlike stake keys, are always visible when providing witnesses). A single vote or a DRep certificate is unlikely to have a major effect (esp. not on the loss of funds). If submitting unintended votes turns out to be a problem, it is likely better to solve it on the level of Cardano blockchain ledger by providing a mechanism allowing for replacing or cancelling votes.\ncardano-hw-interop-library\ncardano-hw-cli\nThe following list of features with missing support on particular hardware devices is subject to occasional changes. Some features might be added, but some could also be removed (e.g. if they take too much space needed for other features).\nEverything described here as allowed should (eventually) work on these devices.\nMissing features:\nMissing features:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This proposal describes a method allowing a stakepool operator to provide credentials to verify that they are the rightful manager for their stakepool.\nMany websites such pooltool.io, adapools.org, and others need to allow pool operators special access to modify the way their pool appears on the website. SPOCRA and other organizations also have a need to allow voting on proposals and ensure that each vote cast is from a valid pool operator. Today, these sites and organizations all use different techniques for validating pool operators.\npooltool.io - Validates operators by receiving 1 ada spent from the pool's registered rewards account\nadapools.org - Validates operators by requesting that the operator include a special generated value in their extended pool metadata json file.\nThis proposal is to simplify and streamline a single approach that all can reference in order to verify that a pool operator is who they say they are.\nIn order to achieve the goals of this CIP, the pool operator needs to provide some credential or credentials to the validating party which cannot be spoofed. The VRF pool keys and VRF signature algorithm implemented in libsodium are chosen to build and provide this credential/signature. This signature can then be validated and the operator verified without ever exposing any of the pool's private key information. This technique is very similar to verifying that a block produced by another pool is valid.

Total Rewards - Total rewards generated by the pool in one epoch. Pool Cur Fee - The total amount of fees taken by the pool with current parameters. Staker Cur Fee - The amount of fees paid by a staker who delegates 100k ADA with currarameters. Staker Cur Rew - The amount of rewards received by a staker who delegates 100k ADA with currarameters. Current Fee - The percentage of rewards taken by the pool as fees with currarameters. Pool New Fee - The total amount of fees taken by the pool with proposed parameters. Staker New Fee - The amount of fees paid by a staker who delegates 100k ADA with proposed parameters. Staker New Rew - The amount of rewards received by a staker who delegates 100k ADA with proposed parameters. New Fee - The percentage of rewards taken by the pool as fees with proposed parameters. Note: All amounts other than s are in ADA.\nThe table above shows that currently a delegator staking 100k ADA to a stakepool with 2m ADA total delegation to the pool is paying an exorbitant 22.7 in fees while the same delegator staking with a fully saturated pool would only pay 0.7 in fees. This is a substantial and unfair advantage that large pools have in the stakepool marketplace. This is a strong incentive to centralize stake to fewer larger pools which reduces the resiliency of the network.\nThe proposed minimum fees bring this imbalance into a more reasonable range of 1.6 to 4.8 . It is much more likely that a small stakepool with other advantages or selling points would be able to convince a delegator to accept about 2 less ADA in rewards per epoch for their 100k delegation than about 17 ADA as in the current case. This is particularly true as the price of ADA increases. At current price of 0.90USD,adelegatorstaking100kADAisgivingupover0.90 USD, a delegator staking 100k ADA is giving up over 0.90USD,adelegatorstaking100kADAisgivingupover1000 USD per year by delegating to a small pool! This does not even include the amount lost by comounding rewards being staked over the year.\n16.5 ADA/epoch * 73 epochs/year = 1204.5 ADA/year 1204.5 ADA/year * 0.90USD/ADA=0.90 USD/ADA = 0.90USD/ADA=1084.05 USD/year\nWith proposed parameters the same delegator would only be giving up about $150 USD per year to support a small pool.\n2.3 ADA/epoch * 73 epochs/year = 167.9 ADA/year 167.9 ADA/year * 0.90USD/ADA=0.90 USD/ADA = 0.90USD/ADA=151.11 USD/year\nThe calculations below show that given the price increase in ADA compared to when the protocol parameters were first set, we can maintain viable funding for stakepool operators with the proposed parameter changes.\nAnnual pool operator funding given initial parameters: 340 ADA/epoch * 0.08USD/ADA=0.08 USD/ADA = 0.08USD/ADA=27.20 USD/epoch 27.20USD/epoch 73epochs/year=27.20 USD/epoch * 73 epochs/year = 27.20USD/epoch 73epochs/year=1985.60 USD/year\nAnnual pool operator funding given proposed parameters for stakepool with 2 million ADA delegation: 71.8 ADA/epoch * 0.90USD/ADA=0.90 USD/ADA = 0.90USD/ADA=64.62 USD/epoch 64.62USD/epoch 73epochs/year=64.62 USD/epoch * 73 epochs/year = 64.62USD/epoch 73epochs/year=4717.26 USD/year\nAnnual pool operator funding given proposed parameters for fully saturated stakepool: 769.6 ADA/epoch * 0.90USD/ADA=0.90 USD/ADA = 0.90USD/ADA=692.64 USD/epoch 692.64USD/epoch 73epochs/year=692.64 USD/epoch * 73 epochs/year = 692.64USD/epoch 73epochs/year=50,562.72 USD/year\nIn summary, the proposed parameter changes would create a more fair marketplace for stakepools, provide more fair rewards for delegators to smaller pools and would lower incentives for centralization providing a more resilient network.\nSee the minfees.php code to test different potential values of the parameters.\nminPoolRate\nminPoolCost\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "Modify the current Daedalus ranking system by removing the centralizing Nash Equilibrium goal of the ranking methodology in order to give more fair rankings and improve the viability of the stake pool operator community and the network overall. To do this we need to remove the stated goal of having k fully saturated pools and all other pools having no stake other than owner pledge, which goes against the Cardano goal of decentralization.\nThere are two main reasons for changing the current ranking methodology:\nAllow for more than k successful stake pools.\nProvide better decentralization away from a very few stake pool operators creating many pools.\nThis is a modification of the ranking methodology defined in section 5.6 Non-Myopic Utility of Shelley Ledger: Delegation/Incentives Design Spec. (SL-D1 v.1.20, 2020/07/06) as follows:\n\"The idea is to first rank all pools by desirability , to then assume that the k most desirable pools will eventually be saturated, whereas all other pools will lose all their members, then to finally base all reward calculations on these assumptions.\"\n\"We predict that pools with rank k will eventually be saturated, whereas pools with rank\nk will lose all members and only consist of the owner(s).\"\nFor all pools with proposed_pool_stake greater than saturation_warning_stake add k to their rank. Where: proposed_pool_stake = pool_live_stake + proposed_user_stake saturation_warning_stake = (total_stake / k) * saturation_warning_level saturation_warning_level is a real number greater than 0 representing the percent of saturation which is undesirable. A proposed value for saturation_warning_level is 0.95 meaning 95 saturated.\nFor example, if a pool has non-myopic desirability rank of 3, pool_live_stake of 207m ADA, proposed_user_stake of 100k ADA with total_stake of 31.7b ADA, k = 150 and saturation_warning_level = 0.95, we would calculate: 207m + 100k (31.7b / 150) * 0.95 and see that 207.1m 200.8m is true so we would change the pool rank to 153 (3 + k) and all pools previously ranked 4 through 153 would move up 1 rank.\nRemove secion 5.6.2.\nRemove section 5.6.3.\nRemove section 5.6.4.\nAdd to secion 5.6.5.\nFor example, apparent performance, desirability and ranking can be made non-myopic for ranking purposes as follows:\ndnm[n] := average(d[1]...d[n],and[n + 1]...and[i]) if n i average(d[1]...d[n]) if n = i (dnm[n - 1] * h) + (d[n] * (1 - h)) otherwise.\nwhere: n = epoch number beginning at n = 1 in the first epoch that the pool is eligible for potential rewards. dnm[n] = the non-myopic desirability of the pool in the nth epoch. d[n] = the desirability in the nth epoch unaware of historical desirability. and[n] = the average desirability of the network as a whole in the nth epoch unaware of historical desirability. h = historical influence factor, which is any real number between 0 and 1 exlusive. i = integer(1 / h) which is the initial number of epochs during which we use the average desirability\nAs an example, setting h to 0.1 would mean that the initial number of epochs for using the averaging functions (i) would be 10. If a pool has been eligible to receive rewards (n) for 3 epochs then we use the average of the pool's desirability for those 3 epochs and the overall network desirability for the prior 7 epochs. After the 10th epoch we would use 90 of the previous epoch's non-myopic historical desirability and 10 of the current epoch's desirability to arrive at the new non-myopic desirability.\nThis gives a more reasonable ranking for newer pools that do not have enough historical data to provide fair rankings.\nUsing this non-centralizing ranking methodology gives a more fair ranking of stake pools based on performance, pledge and saturation which will encourage delegators to choose better pools. It will also bring the rankings more in line with the general Cardano principle of increasing decentralization.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This proposal defines an Media Token Metadata Standard for Native Tokens.\nTokens on Cardano are a part of the ledger. Unlike on Ethereum, where metadata can be attached to a token through a smart contract, this isn't possible on Cardano because tokens are native and Cardano uses a UTxO ledger, which makes it hard to directly attach metadata to a token. So the link to the metadata needs to be established differently.\nCardano has the ability to send metadata in a transaction, allowing the creation of a link between a token and the metadata. To make the link unique, the metadata should be appended to the same transaction, where the token forge happens:\nGiven a token in a EUTXOma ledger, we can ask where did this token come from? Since tokens are always created in specific forging operations, we can always trace them back through their transaction graph to their origin.\nSection 4 in the paper UTXOma:UTXO with Multi-Asset Support\nThat being said, we have unique metadata link to a token and can always prove that with 100 certainty. No one else can manipulate the link except if the policy allows it to (update mechanism).\nThis is the registered transaction_metadatum_label value\ntransaction_metadatum_label\nThe structure allows for multiple token mints, also with different policies, in a single transaction.\n{ \"721\": { \"<policy_id>\": { \"<asset_name>\": { \"name\": <string>, \"image\": <uri | array>, \"mediaType\": image/<mime_sub_type>, \"description\": <string | array>, \"files\": [{ \"name\": <string>, \"mediaType\": <mime_type>, \"src\": <uri | array>, <other_properties> }], <other properties> } }, \"version\": <version_id> } }\n{ \"721\": { \"<policy_id>\": { \"<asset_name>\": { \"name\": <string>, \"image\": <uri | array>, \"mediaType\": image/<mime_sub_type>, \"description\": <string | array>, \"files\": [{ \"name\": <string>, \"mediaType\": <mime_type>, \"src\": <uri | array>, <other_properties> }], <other properties> } }, \"version\": <version_id> } }\nVersion 1 Version 2\nIn version 1 the asset_name must be utf-8 encoded and in text format for the key in the metadata map. In version 2 the the raw bytes of the asset_name are used.\n1\nasset_name\nutf-8\n2\nasset_name\nIn version 1 the policy_id must be in text format for the key in the metadata map. In version 2 the the raw bytes of the policy_id are used.\n1\npolicy_id\n2\npolicy_id\nThe name property is marked as required.\nname\nThe image property is required and must be a valid Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) pointing to a resource with mime type image/*. Note that this resource is used as thumbnail or the actual link if the token is an image (ideally = 1MB). If the string representing the resource location is 64 characters, an array may be used in place of a simple JSON string type, which viewers will automatically concatenate to create a single URI.\nimage\nimage/*\nipfs://\nar://\n\"https://cardano.org/favicon-32x32.png\"\n\"ipfs://QmbQDvKJeo2NgGcGdnUiUFibTzuKNK5Uij7jzmK8ZccmWp\"\n[\"ipfs://\", \"QmbQDvKJeo2NgGcGdnUiUFibTzuKNK5Uij7jzmK8ZccmWp\"]\n\"cardano.org/favicon-32x32.png\"\n\"QmbQDvKJeo2NgGcGdnUiUFibTzuKNK5Uij7jzmK8ZccmWp\"\n[\"Qm\", \"bQDvKJeo2NgGcGdnUiUFibTzuKNK5Uij7jzmK8ZccmWp\"]\ndata:<mime_type>;base64\nThe description property is optional.\ndescription\nThe mediaType and files properties are optional. mediaType is however required inside files. The src property inside files is an URI pointing to a resource of this mime type. If the mime type is image/*, mediaType points to the same image, like the on in the image property, but in an higher resolution.\nmediaType\nfiles\nmediaType\nfiles\nsrc\nfiles\nimage/*\nmediaType\nimage\nThe version property is also optional. If not specified the version is 1. It will become mandatory in future versions if needed.\nversion\n1\nThis structure really just defines the basis. New properties and standards can be defined later on for varies uses cases. That's why there is an \"other properties\" tag.\nThe retrieval of the metadata should be the same for all however.\nOptional fields allow to save space in the blockchain. Consequently the minimal structure for a single token is:\n{ \"721\": { \"<policy_id>\": { \"<asset_name>\": { \"name\": <string>, \"image\": <uri | array> } } } }\n{ \"721\": { \"<policy_id>\": { \"<asset_name>\": { \"name\": <string>, \"image\": <uri | array> } } } }\n{ \"721\": { \"<policy_id>\": { \"<asset_name>\": { \"name\": <string>, \"image\": <uri | array> } }, \"version\": 2 } }\n{ \"721\": { \"<policy_id>\": { \"<asset_name>\": { \"name\": <string>, \"image\": <uri | array> } }, \"version\": 2 } }\nAs mentioned above this metadata structure allows to have either one token or multiple tokens with also different policies in a single mint transaction. A third party tool can then fetch the token metadata seamlessly. It doesn't matter if the metadata includes just one token or multiple. The procedure for the third party is always the same:\nUsing the latest mint transaction with the label 721 as valid metadata for a token allows to update the metadata link of this token. As soon as a new mint transaction is occurring including metadata with the label 721 and a positive amount of the token, the metadata link is considered updated and the new metadata should be used. This is only possible if the policy allows to mint or burn the same token again.\nSince modern token policies or ledger rules should generally make burning of tokens permissionless, the metadata update is restricted to minting (as in positive amounts) transaction and excludes burning transactions explicitly.\nTo keep token metadata compatible with changes coming up in the future, we use the version property. A future version will introduce schema.org.\nversion\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "We introduce a standard for off-chain metadata that can map opaque on-chain identifiers to metadata suitable for human consumption. This will support user-interface components, and allow resolving trust issues in a moderately decentralized way.\nOn the blockchain, we tend to refer to things by hashes or other opaque identifiers. But these are not very human friendly:\nWe think there is a case for a metadata distribution system that would fill these needs in a consistent fashion. This would be very useful for Plutus, multi-asset support, and perhaps even some of the existing Cardano infrastructure. Moreover, since much of the metadata which we want to store is not determined by the blockchain, we propose a system that is independent of the blockchain, and relies on non-blockchain trust mechanisms.\nThe Rationale section provides additional justifications for the design decisions in this document.\nMany pieces of information on the Cardano blockchain are stored as hashes, and only revealed at later stages when required for validation. This is the case for example of scripts (Plutus or phase-1), datums, and public keys. It is likely that (some) users will want to know the preimages of those hashes in a somewhat reliable way and, before they are revealed on-chain.\nUnlike some (un)popular opinions suggest, a blockchain is a poor choice for a content database. Blockchains are intrinsically ledgers and they are good at recording events or hashes. Yet, there are several elements for which hashes aren't providing a great user experience and to which we would rather attach some human-readable metadata (like names, websites, contact details etc...). This is the case for stake pool for instance for which SMASH already provides a solution. This is also the case for monetary policies and scripts. In both cases, having the ability to attach extra metadata to some hash with a way to ensure the authenticity of the data is useful.\nThis specification covers some parts of a bigger system likely involving multiple components. What part is being implemented and by who is considered out of the scope of this specification. We however envision a setup in which users have access to a client application (a.k.a the wallet), which itself is able to connect to some remote server. We assume the server to also offer a user-interface (either via a graphical user-interface or a application programming interface) for accepting content.\nNote The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\nThere are several places in this document where we need an arbitrary hash function. We will henceforth refer to this simply as hash . The hash function MUST be Blake2b-256 (unless explicitly said otherwise). The hash of a string is the hash of the bytes of the string according to its encoding.\nMetadata consists of a mandatory metadata subject, and a number of metadata properties which describes that subject. Each property consists of a mapping from property names to property values, sequence numbers and signatures.\nMetadata subjects, property names, and property values must all be represented as UTF-8 encoded strings. In addition, property values must parse as valid JSON.\nThere is no particular interpretation attached to a metadata subject: it can be anything (see however the special-case of phase-1 monetary policy below). We anticipate however that the primary use-case for it will be something that appears on the blockchain, like the hash of a script.\nWe will refer to a whole metadata as a metadata object and to a particular property assignment for a particular metadata subject as a metadata entry. We will say that a metadata object is well-formed when it validates according to the JSON-schema specification given in annex. To be valid, a metadata object MUST be (at least) well-formed.\n{ \"subject\": \"a5408d0db0d942fd80374\", \"contact\": { \"value\": \"Cid Kramer\", \"sequenceNumber\": 0, \"signatures\": [ { \"signature\": \"79a4601\", \"publicKey\": \"bc77d04\" } ] } }\n{ \"subject\": \"a5408d0db0d942fd80374\", \"contact\": { \"value\": \"Cid Kramer\", \"sequenceNumber\": 0, \"signatures\": [ { \"signature\": \"79a4601\", \"publicKey\": \"bc77d04\" } ] } }\nMetadata entries MUST have a sequenceNumber associated with them. This is a monotonically increasing integer which is used to ensure that clients and servers do not revert to earlier versions of an entry. Upon receiving new metadata objects, servers SHOULD verify the sequence number for each entry already known for that subject and reject submissions with a lower sequence number.\nsequenceNumber\nMetadata entries MAY have attestations signatures associated with them, in the form of an array of objects. Attestation signatures are indeed annotated. An annotated signature for a message is an object with of a publicKey, and a signature of a specified message (see below) by the corresponding private key.\nsignatures\npublicKey\nsignature\nnote\nWhen we say signature in the rest of this document we mean annotated signature .\nAn attestation signature for an entry is a signature of the entry message:\nhash( hash(CBOR(subject)) + hash(CBOR(name)) + hash(CBOR(value)) + hash(CBOR(sequenceNumber)) )\nhash( hash(CBOR(subject)) + hash(CBOR(name)) + hash(CBOR(value)) + hash(CBOR(sequenceNumber)) )\nwhere + designates the concatenation of two bytestrings and CBOR designates a function which encodes its input into binary according to RFC-8949. That is, JSON strings are encoded as major type 3, JSON integers as major types 0 or 1, JSON floats as major type 7, JSON arrays as major type 4, JSON objects as major type 5, JSON booleans as major type 7 and JSON null as major type 7; according to the specification.\n+\nCBOR\nFor example, the attestation message for the example entry above is:\nhash( hash(0x75613534303864306462306439343266643830333734) + // text \"a5408d0db0d942fd80374\" hash(0x67636F6E74616374) + // text \"contact\" hash(0x6A436964204B72616D6572) + // text \"Cid Kramer\" hash(0x00) // uint 0 ) // cd731afcc904c521e0c6b3cc0b560b8157ee29c3e41cd15f8dc8984edf600029\nhash( hash(0x75613534303864306462306439343266643830333734) + // text \"a5408d0db0d942fd80374\" hash(0x67636F6E74616374) + // text \"contact\" hash(0x6A436964204B72616D6572) + // text \"Cid Kramer\" hash(0x00) // uint 0 ) // cd731afcc904c521e0c6b3cc0b560b8157ee29c3e41cd15f8dc8984edf600029\nThe publicKey and the signature MUST be base16-encoded and stored as JSON strings. All signatures must be verifiable through the Ed25519 digital signature scheme and public keys must therefore be 32-byte long Ed25519 public keys.\npublicKey\nsignature\nThe following properties are considered well-known, and the JSON in their values MUST have the given structure and semantic interpretation. New properties can be added to this list by amending this CIP. The role of well-known properties is to facilitate integration between applications implementing this CIP. Nevertheless, registries are encouraged to not restrict properties to only this limited set but, registries (or metadata servers) MUST verify the well-formedness of those properties when present in a metadata object.\n{ \"type\": \"object\", \"description\": \"A hashing algorithm identifier and a base16-enocoded bytestring, such that the bytestring is the preimage of the metadata subject under that hash function.\", \"requiredProperties\": [ \"alg\", \"msg\" ], \"properties\": { \"alg\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A hashing algorithm identifier.

We will call such applications \"clients\". Conceptually we expect clients to maintain a mapping of many subjects to many verification keys. In case where a metadata entry contains no signatures, when none of the provided signatures was produced by a known key for the corresponding subject or when none of the provided signatures verifies: the metadata entry MUST be considered invalid and not be presented to end-users.\nNote that:\nIn this scenario, a single valid signature is sufficient to consider a metadata entry valid but there can be many signatures (invalid or valid). So long as one is valid, the entry is considered verified.\nThe verification is done per entry. That is, a metadata object may contain both verified and unverified entries. Plus, entries under the same subject may be verified by different keys.\nThe way by which the trusted keys are registered into clients is unspecified although we already consider the following, non-overlapping, complementary, options:\nClients MAY explicitly prompt the consumer / end-user about whether to accept a certain entry. While this is unpractical for some cases (e.g. token metadata), it may be relevant for some.\nClients MAY come with a set of pre-configured well-known trusted keys chosen at the discretion of the application editor.\nEnd-users SHOULD have the ability to add/remove keys from their trusted set. This allows end-users to introduce trusted keys they know before they end up in the pre-configured set (which likely follow the application release cycle). In this context, keys are advertised by the signing authority by some means, for instance, on social media or on another form of public key registry (e.g. keybase.io)\nMappings of subjects to keys MAY be recorded on-chain, using transaction metadata and an appropriate label registered on CIP-0010. In some scenarios, the context within which the transaction is signed may be enough to reliably trust the legitimacy of a mapping. For example, in the case of a monetary policy, one could imagine registering trusted keys in the same transaction minting tokens. Because the transaction is inserted in the ledger, it must have been signed by the token issuer and therefore, the specified keys are without doubt acknowledged by the token issuer. As a result, clients having access to on-chain data can automatically discover new mappings from observing the chain.\nnote\nThis approach is now considered superseded by the more general approach. While it has some nice properties, new applications should consider sticking to the general case even for phase-1 monetary policies. Servers who seek backward-compatibility should implement both.\nWe consider the case of phase-1 monetary policies introduced during the Allegra era of Cardano. Such policies are identified by a simple (native) script which is validated by the ledger during the so-called phase-1 validations. Such scripts are made of key hashes, combined via a set of basic first-order logic primitives (ALL, ANY-OF, N-OF...) such that, it is possible to statically verify whether a set of signatures would validate the script.\nThese scripts therefore make relatively good verification mechanisms for metadata associated with phase-1 monetary policies. Hence, we introduce the following well-known property:\n{ \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A CBOR-serialized phase-1 monetary policy, used as a pre-image to produce a policyId.\", \"encoding\": \"base16\", \"minLength\": 56, \"maxLength\": 120 }\n{ \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A CBOR-serialized phase-1 monetary policy, used as a pre-image to produce a policyId.\", \"encoding\": \"base16\", \"minLength\": 56, \"maxLength\": 120 }\nMetadata objects that contain an extra top-level property policy MUST therefore abide by the following rules:\npolicy\nassetId\nassetId\npolicyId\nassetName\npolicy\nFor example, consider the following phase-1 monetary policy, represented in JSON:\n{ \"type\": \"all\", \"scripts\": [ { \"keyHash\": \"2B0C33E73D2A70733EDC971D19E2CAFBADA1692DB2D35E7DC9453DF2\", \"type\": \"sig\" }, { \"keyHash\": \"E2CAFBADA1692DB2D35E7DC9453DF22B0C33E73D2A70733EDC971D19\", \"type\": \"sig\" } ] }\n{ \"type\": \"all\", \"scripts\": [ { \"keyHash\": \"2B0C33E73D2A70733EDC971D19E2CAFBADA1692DB2D35E7DC9453DF2\", \"type\": \"sig\" }, { \"keyHash\": \"E2CAFBADA1692DB2D35E7DC9453DF22B0C33E73D2A70733EDC971D19\", \"type\": \"sig\" } ] }\nTo validate such a policy, each entry would require 2 signatures:\n2B0C33E73D2A70733EDC971D19E2CAFBADA1692DB2D35E7DC9453DF2\nE2CAFBADA1692DB2D35E7DC9453DF22B0C33E73D2A70733EDC971D19\nThe policy MAY also contain some additional time constraints (VALID-AFTER, VALID-BEFORE) specifying a certain slot number. For the sake of verifying policies, these should be ignored and consider valid.\nThe following section gives some recommendations to application developers willing to implement a metadata server / registry. Following these recommendations will facilitate interoperability between applications and also, provide some good security foundation for the server. In this context, what we refer to as a metadata server is a web server that exposes the functionality of a simple key-value store, where the keys are metadata subjects and property names, and the values are their property values.\nThe metadata server SHOULD implement the following HTTP methods:\nGET /metadata/{subject}/property/{property name}\nGET /metadata/{subject}/property/{property name}\nThis SHOULD return the property values for the given property name (if any) associated with the subject. This is returned as a array of JSON objects whose key is the property name and return the complete JSON entries for that subject+name (including value, sequenceNumber and signatures).\nvalue\nsequenceNumber\nsignatures\nThe metadata server SHOULD set the Content-Length header to allow clients to decide if they wish to download sizeable metadata.\nGET /metadata/{subject}/properties\nGET /metadata/{subject}/properties\nThis SHOULD return all the property names which are available for that subject (if any). These are returned as a JSON list of strings.\nGET /metadata/{subject}\nGET /metadata/{subject}\nThis SHOULD return a array of the full metadata objects associated with this subject, including the subject and all properties associated with it.\nPOST /metadata/query REQUEST BODY : a JSON object with the keys: “subjects” : A list of subjects, encoded as strings in the same way as the queries above. “properties” : An optional list of property names, encoded as strings in the same way as the query above.\nPOST /metadata/query REQUEST BODY : a JSON object with the keys: “subjects” : A list of subjects, encoded as strings in the same way as the queries above. “properties” : An optional list of property names, encoded as strings in the same way as the query above.\nThis endpoint provides a way to batch queries, making several requests of the server with only one HTTP request.\nIf only subjects is supplied, this query SHOULD return a list of subjects with all their properties. The response format will be as similar as possible to the GET /metadata/{subject} request, but nested inside a list.\n“subjects”\nGET /metadata/{subject}\nIf subjects and properties are supplied, the query will return a list of subjects, with their properties narrowed down to only those specified by properties .\n“subjects”\n“properties”\n“properties”\nsuggestion\nMetadata servers MAY provide other methods of querying metadata, such as:\nThe metadata server needs some way to add and modify metadata entries. The method for doing so is largely up to the implementor, but recommend to abide by the following rules:\nIf the server supports modifications to metadata entries, it SHOULD provide some form of authentication which controls who can modify them. Servers MUST NOT use the attestation signatures on metadata entries as part of authentication (with the exception of phase-1 monetary policy). Attestation signatures are per-entry, and are orthogonal to determining who controls the metadata for a subject.\nSimple systems may want to use little more than cryptographic signatures, but more sophisticated systems could have registered user accounts and control access in that way.\nThe metadata server MAY provide a mechanism auditing changes to metadata, for example by storing the update history of an entry and allowing users to query it (via the API or otherwise).\nAllowing unrestricted updates to non-verifiable metadata would allow malicious users to squat or take over another user s metadata subjects. This is why we recommend that server implementations have some kind of authentication system to mitigate this.\nOne approach is to have a system of ownership of metadata subjects. This notion of ownership is vague, although in some cases there are obvious choices (e.g. for a multisig minting policy, the obvious owners are the signatories who can authorize minting). It is up to the server to pick a policy for how to decide on owners, and enforce security; or indeed to take a different approach entirely.\nSee the earlier Authentication section for a description of a possible approach to managing ownership.\nDepending on the authentication mechanism they use, servers may also need to worry about replay attacks, where an attacker submits a (correctly signed) old record to revert a legitimate change. However, these can be unconditionally prevented by correctly implementing sequence numbers as described earlier, which prevents old entries from being accepted.\nSimilar to the recommendations for metadata servers, this section gives some recommendations to application developers willing to implement a metadata client. Following these recommendations will facilitate interoperability between applications and also, provide some good security foundation for the clients. A metadata client refers to the component that communicates with a metadata server and maintains the user s trusted metadata mapping. This may be implemented as part of a larger system, or may be an independent component (which could be shared between multiple other systems, e.g. a wallet frontend and a blockchain explorer).\nThe design space for a metadata server is quite large. For example, any of the following examples could work, or other combinations of these features:\nThis design aims to be agnostic about the details of the implementation, by specifying only a very simple interface between the client, server, and system-component users (wallet, etc.). This allows:\nFor much of the metadata we are concerned with there is no right answer. The metadata server is thus playing a key trusted role - even if that trust is partial because users can rely on attestation signatures. We therefore believe that it is critical that we allow users to choose which metadata server (or servers) they refer to.\nAn analogy is with DNS nameservers: these are a trusted piece of infrastructure for any particular user, but users have a choice of which nameservers to use, and can use multiple.\nThis also makes it possible for these servers to be a true piece of community infrastructure, rather than something wedded to a major player (although we hope that the Cardano Foundation and IOHK will produce a competitive offering).\nA key distinction is between metadata that is verifiably correct and that which is non-verifiable.\nThe key example of verifiable metadata is hashe pre-images. Where the metadata subject is a hash, the preimage of that hash is verifiable metadata, since we can simply hash it and check that it matches. This covers several cases that we are interested in:\nHowever, most metadata is non-verifiable:\nMost of the security considerations relate to non-verifiable metadata. Verifiable metadata can generally always be accepted as is (provided that it is verified). Our threat model is that non-verifiable metadata may always have been provided by an attacker.\nAccepting non-verifiable metadata blindly can lead to attacks. For example, a malicious server or user might attempt to name their currency Ada . If we blindly accept this and overwrite the existing mapping for Ada , this would lead to easy phishing attacks. The approach we take is heavily inspired by petname systems, GPG keyservers, and local address books. The user always has a local mapping which is trusted, and then adding to or updating that mapping requires explicit user consent, unless we can prove that this is trustworthy (i.e. the metadata is verifiable).\nHow can users decide whether to trust an update? This is where the attestation signatures come into play. If a user trusts the entity which signs the metadata record, that may be sufficient for them to accept it as a legitimate update.\nClients could also be tricked into downloading large amounts of metadata that the user does not want. For this reason clients should expose some kind of configurable download limiting, and we suggest that the server set the Content-Length header to support this. However, this problem is no worse than that faced by the average web browser, so we do not think it will be a problem in practice.\nClients also need to worry about replay attacks, where they are sent old (correctly signed) records in an attempt to roll back a legitimate update. The easiest way to avoid this is to correctly implement sequence numbers, in which case old updates will be rejected.\nThis design needs to store a fair amount of data in a shared location. We might wonder whether we should use the blockchain for this: we could store metadata updates in transaction metadata.\nHowever, storing this information on-chain does not actually help us:\nBesides, on-chain storage comes with considerable downsides:\nFor this reason, we think that a traditional database is a much better fit. However, it would be perfectly possible for someone to produce an implementation that was backed by the chain if they believed that that could be competitive.\nMetadata may potentially be sizable. For example, preimages of hashes can in principle be any size!\nServers will want some way to manage this to avoid abuse. However, this is a typical problem faced by web services and can be solved in the usual ways: size limits per account, charging for storage, etc.\nSee Special Case: Phase-1 Monetary Policies which covers existing implementations.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

It is easy to implement using metadata only, and does not require a smart contract. However, it is scalable to allow for the usage of a downstream smart contract, as needed by the asset creator.\nThere is a significant interest within the Cardano Community for an implementation of royalties distribution when a Cardano Asset is resold on the secondary market. It has become a common theme to see and hear statements that the only thing stopping artists from adopting Cardano, is that they are waiting for an implementation of royalties.\nAt the present time, smart contracts do not create a simple mechanism to implement royalties. By developing a community standard, we can resolve the immediate need for royalties, and create a path forward for a potential future iteration of smart contracts.\nA new tag of 777 is proposed for this implementation.

The design of this spec was based on the latter.\nIn order to facilitate future dApp development, we will need a way for dApps to communicate with the user's wallet.

For example:\n\"cip\"\n{ \"cip\": 30 }\n{ \"cip\": 30 }\nAPIErrorCode { InvalidRequest: -1, InternalError: -2, Refused: -3, AccountChange: -4, } APIError { code: APIErrorCode, info: string }\nAPIErrorCode { InvalidRequest: -1, InternalError: -2, Refused: -3, AccountChange: -4, } APIError { code: APIErrorCode, info: string }\nwallet.enable()\nDataSignErrorCode { ProofGeneration: 1, AddressNotPK: 2, UserDeclined: 3, } type DataSignError = { code: DataSignErrorCode, info: String }\nDataSignErrorCode { ProofGeneration: 1, AddressNotPK: 2, UserDeclined: 3, } type DataSignError = { code: DataSignErrorCode, info: String }\ntype PaginateError = {| maxSize: number, |};\ntype PaginateError = {| maxSize: number, |};\n{maxSize} is the maximum size for pagination and if the dApp tries to request pages outside of this boundary this error is thrown.\nTxSendErrorCode = { Refused: 1, Failure: 2, } type TxSendError = { code: TxSendErrorCode, info: String }\nTxSendErrorCode = { Refused: 1, Failure: 2, } type TxSendError = { code: TxSendErrorCode, info: String }\nTxSignErrorCode = { ProofGeneration: 1, UserDeclined: 2, } type TxSignError = { code: TxSignErrorCode, info: String }\nTxSignErrorCode = { ProofGeneration: 1, UserDeclined: 2, } type TxSignError = { code: TxSignErrorCode, info: String }\nIn order to initiate communication from webpages to a user's Cardano wallet, the wallet must provide the following javascript API to the webpage. A shared, namespaced cardano object must be injected into the page if it did not exist already. Each wallet implementing this standard must then create a field in this object with a name unique to each wallet containing a wallet object with the following methods. The API is split into two stages to maintain the user's privacy, as the user will have to consent to cardano.{walletName}.enable() in order for the dApp to read any information pertaining to the user's wallet with {walletName} corresponding to the wallet's namespaced name of its choice.\ncardano\nwallet\ncardano.{walletName}.enable()\n{walletName}\ncardano.{walletName}.enable({ extensions: Extension[] } = {}): Promise<API>\nErrors: APIError\nAPIError\nThis is the entrypoint to start communication with the user's wallet. The wallet should request the user's permission to connect the web page to the user's wallet, and if permission has been granted, the full API will be returned to the dApp to use. The wallet can choose to maintain a whitelist to not necessarily ask the user's permission every time access is requested, but this behavior is up to the wallet and should be transparent to web pages using this API. If a wallet is already connected this function should not request access a second time, and instead just return the API object.\nAPI\nUpon start, dApp can explicitly request a list of additional functionalities they expect as a list of CIP numbers capturing those extensions. This is used as an extensibility mechanism to document what functionalities can be provided by the wallet interface. CIP-0030 provides a set of base interfaces that every wallet must support. Then, new functionalities are introduced via additional CIPs and may be all or partially supported by wallets.\nDApps are expected to use this endpoint to perform an initial handshake and ensure that the wallet supports all their required functionalities. Note that it's possible for two extensions to be mutually incompatible (because they provide two conflicting features). While we may try to avoid this as much as possible while designing CIPs, it is also the responsability of wallet providers to assess whether they can support a given combination of extensions, or not. Hence wallets aren't expected to fail should they not recognize or not support a particular combination of extensions. Instead, they should decide what they enable and reflect their choice in the response to api.getExtensions() in the Full API. As a result, dApps may fail and inform their users or may use a different, less-efficient, strategy to cope with a lack of functionality.\napi.getExtensions()\nIt is at the extension author's discretion if they wish to separate their endpoints from the base API via namespacing. Although, it is highly recommend that authors do namespace all of their extensions. If namespaced, endpoints must be preceded by .cipXXXX. from the API object, without any leading zeros.\n.cipXXXX.\nAPI\nFor example; CIP-0123's endpoints should be accessed by:\napi.cip123.endpoint1() api.cip123.endpoint2()\napi.cip123.endpoint1() api.cip123.endpoint2()\nAuthors should be careful when omitting namespacing. Omission should only be considered when creating endpoints to override those defined in this specification or other extensions. Even so when overriding; the new functionality should not prevent dApps from accessing past functionality thus overriding must ensure backwards compatibility.\nAny namespace omission needs to be fully justified via the proposal's Rationale section, with explanation to why it is necessary. Any potential backwards compatibility considerations should be noted to give wallets and dApps a clear unambiguous direction.\nExtensions that are draft, in development, or prototyped should not use extension naming nor should they use official namspacing until assigned a CIP number. Draft extension authors are free to test their implementation endpoints by using the Experimental API. Once a CIP number is assigned implementors should move functionality out of the experimental API.\nYes. Extensions may have other extensions as pre-requisite. Some newer extensions may also invalidate functionality introduced by earlier extensions. There's no particular rule or constraints in that regards. Extensions are specified as CIP, and will define what it entails to enable them.\nYes. They all are CIPs.\nYes. Extensions may introduce new endpoints or error codes, and modify existing ones. Although, it is recommended that endpoints are namespaced. Extensions may even change the rules outlined in this very proposal.

All read-only methods (all but the signing functionality) should not require any user interaction as the user has already consented to the dApp reading information about the wallet's state when they agreed to cardano.{walletName}.enable().

With a single required parameter for now: amount. (NOTE: some wallets may be ignoring the amount parameter, in which case it might be possible to call the function without it, but this behavior is not recommended!). Reasons why the amount parameter is required:\namount\namount\nSo requiring the amount parameter would be a by-spec behavior for a wallet. Not requiring it is possible, but not specified, so dapps should not rely on that and the behavior is not recommended.\namount\nThis shall return a list of one or more UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) controlled by the wallet that are required to reach AT LEAST the combined ADA value target specified in amount AND the best suitable to be used as collateral inputs for transactions with plutus script inputs (pure ADA-only utxos). If this cannot be attained, an error message with an explanation of the blocking problem shall be returned. NOTE: wallets are free to return utxos that add up to a greater total ADA value than requested in the amount parameter, but wallets must never return any result where utxos would sum up to a smaller total ADA value, instead in a case like that an error message must be returned.\namount\namount\nThe main point is to allow the wallet to encapsulate all the logic required to handle, maintain, and create (possibly on-demand) the UTXOs suitable for collateral inputs. For example, whenever attempting to create a plutus-input transaction the dapp might encounter a case when the set of all user UTXOs don't have any pure entries at all, which are required for the collateral, in which case the dapp itself is forced to try and handle the creation of the suitable entries by itself. If a wallet implements this function it allows the dapp to not care whether the suitable utxos exist among all utxos, or whether they have been stored in a separate address chain (see https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/104), or whether they have to be created at the moment on-demand - the wallet guarantees that the dapp will receive enough utxos to cover the requested amount, or get an error in case it is technically impossible to get collateral in the wallet (e.g. user does not have enough ADA at all).\nThe amount parameter is required, specified as a string (BigNumber) or a number, and the maximum allowed value must be agreed to be something like 5 ADA. Not limiting the maximum possible value might force the wallet to attempt to purify an unreasonable amount of ADA just because the dapp is doing something weird. Since by protocol the required collateral amount is always a percentage of the transaction fee, it seems that the 5 ADA limit should be enough for the foreseeable future.\namount\nstring\nnumber\napi.getBalance(): Promise<cbor<value>>\nErrors: APIError\nAPIError\nReturns the total balance available of the wallet.

    "prompt": "CIP0031?",
    "completion": "We introduce a new kind of input, a reference input, which allows looking at an output without spending it. This will facilitate access to information stored on the blockchain without the churn associated with spending and recreating UTXOs.\nDatums in transaction outputs provide a way to store and access information on the blockchain. However, they are quite constrained in a number of ways. Most notably, in order to access the information which is contained in them, you have to spend the output that the datum is attached to.\nThis has a number of undesirable features:\nWe would like to have a mechanism for accessing the information in datums that avoids these issues.\nHere are some cases where we expect this to be helpful.\nThis proposal was designed in tandem with two further proposals which make use of reference scripts, CIP-32 (Inline datums) and CIP-33 (Reference scripts). A full assessment of the worth of this proposal should take into account the fact that it is an enabler for these other proposals.\nWe introduce a new kind of transaction input, a reference input. Transaction authors specify inputs as either normal (spending) inputs or reference inputs.\nA reference input is a transaction input, which is linked to a particular transaction output as normal, except that it references the output rather than spending it. That is:\nFor clarity, the following two behaviours which are present today are unchanged by this proposal:\nScripts are passed information about transactions via the script context. The script context therefore needs to be augmented to contain information about reference inputs.\nChanging the script context will require a new Plutus language version in the ledger to support the new interface. The change in the new interface is: a new field is added to the structure which contains the list of reference inputs.\nThe interface for old versions of the language will not be changed. Scripts with old versions cannot be spent in transactions that include reference inputs, attempting to do so will be a phase 1 transaction validation failure.\nToday, transactions can contain extra datums that are not required for validation. Currently the extra datums must all be pre-images of datum hashes that appear in outputs. We change this so that the extra datums can also be pre-images of datum hashes that appear in reference inputs.3\nNote that the existing mechanism includes the hash of the extra datum structure in the transaction body, so that additional datums cannot be stripped by an attacker without voiding transaction signatures.\nThe CDDL for transaction bodies will change to the following to reflect the new field.\ntransaction_body = { 0 : set<transaction_input> ; inputs ... , ? 16 : set<transaction_input> ; reference inputs }\ntransaction_body = { 0 : set<transaction_input> ; inputs ... , ? 16 : set<transaction_input> ; reference inputs }\nThe key idea of this proposal is to use UTXOs to carry information. But UTXOs are currently a bad fit for distributing information. Because of locality, we have to include outputs that we use in the transaction, and the only way we have of doing that is to spend them - and a spent output cannot then be referenced by anything else. To put it another way: outputs are resource-like, but information is not resource-like.\nThe solution is to add a way to inspect (\"reference\") outputs without spending them. This allows outputs to play double duty as resource containers (for the value they carry) and information containers (for the data they carry).\nWe have a number of requirements that we need to fulfil.\nReference inputs satisfy these requirements, mostly by inheriting them from the corresponding properties of UTXOs.\nThere are various approaches to augmenting Cardano with the ability to store and retrieve data more easily. All of these require some kind of resource-like system for the storage that is used for data. The main argument in favour of the reference input approach is that it reuses our existing resource-like system: UTXOs.\nAs we've seen above, this allows us to satisfy most of our requirements for free. Any other approach would need new solutions to these problems.\nAs a brief example, suppose we wanted to instead implement data storage as an on-chain, hash-indexed data store (a proposal we considered).\nThen we would need to answer a lot of questions:\nScripts definitely need to see reference inputs. But we have at least two options for how we represent this in the script context: put the reference inputs in their own field; or include them with the other inputs, but tag them appropriately.\nKeeping them separate seems wise given the potential for confusing reference inputs for normal inputs. That would be quite a dangerous programming error, as it might lead a script to believe that e.g. an output had been spent when in fact it had only been referenced.\nWe also have the question of what to do about old scripts. We can't really present the information about reference inputs to them in a faithful way: representing them as spending inputs would be wildly misleading, and there is nowhere else to put them. We could omit the information entirely, but this is dangerous in a different way. Omitting information may lead scripts to make assumptions about the transaction that are untrue; for this reason we prefer not to silently omit information as a general principle. That leaves us only one option: reject transactions where we would have to present information about reference inputs to old scripts.\nCurrently this proposal has somewhat limited utility, because datums in outputs are just hashes, and the spending party is required to find and provide the preimage themselves. Therefore the CIP-32 proposal for inline datums is complementary, as it allow UTXOs to carry the data itself rather than a hash.\nIn the mean time (or if CIP-32 is not implemented), we still want users to be able to provide the datums corresponding to datum hashes in reference outputs, so that at least it is possible to reference the data, albeit clumsily. The easiest solution here is to reuse the existing mechanism for providing pre-images of datum hashes which appear in outputs.\nProviding datum hash pre-images remains optional, since there are reasons to use reference inputs even without looking at the datum, e.g. to look at the value in an output.\nThe motivation of this proposal mainly requires looking at the datums of outputs. But reference inputs allow us to do more: they let us look at the value locked in an output (i.e. how much Ada or other tokens it contains).\nThis is actually a very important feature. Since anyone can lock an output with any address, addresses are not that useful for identifying particular outputs on chain, and instead we usually rely on looking for particular tokens in the value locked by the output. Hence, if a script is interested in referring to the data attached to a particular output, it will likely want to look at the value that is locked in the output.\nFor example, an oracle provider would need to distinguish the outputs that they create (with good data) from outputs created by adversaries (with bad data). They can do this with a token, so long as scripts can then see the token!\nWe want reference inputs to be usable inside Hydra heads. This raises a worry: since Hydra processes independent parts of the transaction graph in parallel, what happens if it accepts one transaction that references an output, and one that spends the output, but then the first transaction gets put into a checkpoint before the second?\nFortunately, Hydra already has to deal with double-spend conflicts of this kind (although in the naive protocol this results in a decommit). This proposal simply introduces a new kind of conflict, a reference-spend conflict. Reference-spend conflicts should be handled by the same mechanism that is used to handle double-spend conflicts.\nOne thing that a user might want to do is to control who can reference an output. For example, an oracle provider might want to only allow a transaction to reference a particular output if the transaction also pays them some money.\nReference inputs alone do not provide any way to do this. Another mechanism would be required, but there is no consensus on what the design should be, so it is currently out of scope for this proposal. A brief summary of a few options and reasons why they are not obvious choices is included below.\nA key issue is that the choice to control referencing must lie with the creator of the output, not the spender. Therefore we must include some kind of change to outputs so that the creator can record their requirements.\nA \"check input\" is like a reference input except that the spending conditions are checked. That is, it acts as proof that you could spend the input, but does not in fact spend it.\nSince check inputs cause validator scripts to be run, it seems like they could allow us to control referencing. There are two wrinkles:\n\"Referencing conditions\" would mean adding a new field to outputs to indicate under what conditions the output may be referenced. This could potentially be an entire additional address, since the conditions might be any of the normal spending conditions (public key or script witnessing).\nHowever, this would make outputs substantially bigger and more complicated.\nReference inputs are very similar to Ergo's \"data inputs\". We chose to name them differently since \"data\" is already a widely used term with risk for confusion. We might also want to introduce other \"verb\" inputs in future.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\nThis restriction already exists, and is important. It seems unnecessary, since transactions must always pay fees and fees must come from somewhere, but fees could in principle be paid via reward withdrawals, so the requirement to spend a UTXO is relevant.\nThat is, this proposal does not change outputs or the spending of outputs, it instead adds a new way of referring to outputs.\nPre-images of datum hashes that appear in spent inputs are of course mandatory.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

  {
    "prompt": "CIP0032?",
    "completion": "We propose to allow datums themselves to be attached to outputs instead of datum hashes. This will allow much simpler communication of datum values between users.\nConceptually, datums are pieces of data that are attached to outputs. However, in practice datums are implemented by attaching hashes of datums to outputs, and requiring that the spending transaction provides the actual datum.\nThis is quite inconvenient for users. Datums tend to represent the result of computation done by the party who creates the output, and as such there is almost no chance that the spending party will know the datum without communicating with the creating party. That means that either the datum must be communicated between parties off-chain, or communicated on-chain by including it in the witness map of the transaction that creates the output (\"extra datums\"). This is also inconvenient for the spending party, who must watch the whole chain to spot it.\nIt would be much more convenient to just put the datum itself in an output, which is what we propose.\nWe expect that, provided we are able to bring the cost low enough, a large proportion of dapp developers will make use of this feature, as it will simplify their systems substantially.\nTransaction outputs are changed so that the datum field can contain either a hash or a datum (an \"inline datum\").\nThe min UTXO value for an output with an inline datum depends on the size of the datum, following the coinsPerUTxOWord protocol parameter.\ncoinsPerUTxOWord\nWhen an output with an inline datum is spent, the spending transaction does not need to provide the datum itself.\nScripts are passed information about transactions via the script context. The script context therefore needs to be augmented to contain information about inline datums.\nChanging the script context will require a new Plutus language version in the ledger to support the new interface.\nThere are two changes in the new version of the interface:\nThe interface for old versions of the language will not be changed. Scripts with old versions cannot be spent in transactions that include inline datums, attempting to do so will be a phase 1 transaction validation failure.\nThe CDDL for transaction outputs will change as follows to reflect the new alternative.\ntransaction_output = [ address , amount : value , ? datum : $hash32 / plutus_data ]\ntransaction_output = [ address , amount : value , ? datum : $hash32 / plutus_data ]\nTODO: should there be a dedicated production for datum-hash-or-datum? Does it need to be tagged?\nThe key idea of this proposal is simply to restore the conceptually straightforward situation where datums are attached to outputs. Historically, this was the way that the EUTXO model was designed, and switching to datum hashes on outputs was done to avoid bloating UTXO entries, which at that time (pre-multiasset) were constant-size (see 1 page 7).\nNow that we have variable-sized UTXO entries and the accounting to support them, we can restore inline datums.\nSince inline datums change very little about the model apart from where data is stored, we don't need to worry about violating any of the other requirements of the ledger, but we do need to worry about the effect on the size of the UTXO set.\nThis proposal gives users a way to put much larger amounts of data into the UTXO set. Won t this lead to much worse UTXO set bloat?\nThe answer is that we already have a mechanism to discourage this, namely the minimum UTXO value. If inline datums turns out to drive significantly increased space usage, then we may need to increase coinsPerUTxOWord in order to keep the UTXO size down. That will be costly and inconvenient for users, but will still allow them to use inline datums where they are most useful and the cost is bearable. Furthermore, we hope that we will in fact be able to reduce coinsPerUTxOWord when the upcoming work on moving the UTXO mostly to on-disk storage is complete.\ncoinsPerUTxOWord\ncoinsPerUTxOWord\nAnother guard rail would be to enforce upper limits on the size of inline datums. At the extreme, we could bound them to the size of a hash, which would guarantee no more space usage than today. However, this is much worse for users, since it introduces a sharp discontinuity where an inline datum is entirely acceptable, until it crosses the size threshold at which point it is unacceptable, and there is no way to avoid this. Generally we prefer to avoid such discontinuities in favour of gradually increasing costs.\nIn practice, what is implemented here may depend on whether the UTXO-on-disk work is completed by the time that this proposal is implemented.\nWe could deprecate the other methods of specifying datums (datum hashes or datum hashes+extra datums). However, the other approaches also have some advantages.\nAny one of these factors could be important to particular use cases, so it is good to retain the other options.\nIn principle we do not need to let scripts see whether a datum is inline or not. We could pretend that inline datums are non-inline and insert them into the datum witness map.\nThe underlying question is: do we want scripts to be able to make assertions about whether datums are inline or not? There are reasons to want to do this: not using inline datums causes communication issues for users, and so it is quite reasonable that an application developer may want to be able to enforce their use.\nFurthermore, as a general principle we try to keep the script context as faithful to real transactions as possible. Even if the use for the information is not immediately obvious, we try to err on the side of providing it and letting users decide.\nHence we do include information about inline datums in the script context.\nThere are a couple of options for how to change the representation of the script context to include the new information, and whether to make a backwards compatibility effort for old language versions.\nFor the new script context:\nFor backwards compatibility:\nFor the new script context, option 1 has the significant advantage of matching the ledger representation of transactions. This makes it easier to implement, and also avoids conceptual overhead for users who would have to distinguish the two ways of representing transactions. While the conceptual distance here may be small, if we let it grow over time then it may become quite confusing.\nWe then have the choice of what to do about backwards compatibility. Option 2 would work, but is more complicated for the ledger and is inconsistent in representation with our choice for the new script context (inline datums are sometimes represented faithfully, and sometimes put in the witness map). Option 1 is simple, but doesn't allow old scripts to work with inline datums. This would not be so bad if it just meant that old scripts could not be spent in transactions that include inline datums, but it also introduces a new way to make an unspendable output. If a user creates an output with an old script and an inline datum, then any transaction spending that output will include an inline datum, which we would not allow.\nUnfortunately, we cannot prevent users from creating such outputs in general, since script addresses do not include the script language, so the ledger cannot tell whether the inline datum is permissible or not. Client code typically will be able to do this, since it will usually know the script.\nThe mitigating factor is that we expect this to be uncommon in practice, particularly since we expect that most users will move to the new version relatively quickly, since we expect support for inline datums to be desirable, and released alongside other desirable features.\nHence we choose both option 1s and do not provide backwards compatibility for old language versions.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\nChakravarty, Manuel M.

    "completion": "We propose to allow scripts (\"reference scripts\") to be attached to outputs, and to allow reference scripts to be used to satisfy script requirements during validation, rather than requiring the spending transaction to do so. This will allow transactions using common scripts to be much smaller.\nScript sizes pose a significant problem. This manifests itself in two ways:\nWe would like to alleviate these problems.\nThe key idea is to use reference inputs and modified outputs which carry actual scripts (\"reference scripts\"), and allow such reference scripts to satisfy the script witnessing requirement for a transaction. This means that the transaction which uses the script will not need to provide it at all, so long as it referenced an output which contained the script.\nWe extend transaction outputs with a new optional field, which contains a script (a \"reference script\").\nThe min UTXO value for an output with an additional script field depends on the size of the script, following the coinsPerUTxOWord protocol parameter.\ncoinsPerUTxOWord\nWhen we are validating a transaction and we look for the script corresponding to a script hash, in addition to the scripts provided in the transaction witnesses, we also consider any reference scripts from the outputs referred to by the inputs of the transaction.\nScripts are passed information about transactions via the script context. We propose to augment the script context to include some information about reference scripts.\nChanging the script context will require a new Plutus language version in the ledger to support the new interface. The change is: a new optional field is added to outputs and inputs to represent reference scripts. Reference scripts are represented by their hash in the script context.\nThe interface for old versions of the language will not be changed. Scripts with old versions cannot be spent in transactions that include reference scripts, attempting to do so will be a phase 1 transaction validation failure.\nThe CDDL for transaction outputs will change as follows to reflect the new field.\ntransaction_output = [ address , amount : value , ? datum : $hash32 , ? ref_script : plutus_script ]\ntransaction_output = [ address , amount : value , ? datum : $hash32 , ? ref_script : plutus_script ]\nTODO: can we use a more generic type that allows any script in a forwards-compatible way?\nThe key idea of this proposal is stop sending frequently-used scripts to the chain every time they are used, but rather make them available in a persistent way on-chain.\nThe implementation approach follows in the wake of CIP-31 (Reference inputs) and CIP-32 (Inline datums). The former considers how to do data sharing on chain, and concludes that referencing UTXOs is a good solution. The latter shows how we can safely store substantial data in UTXOs by taking advantage of existing mechanisms for size control.\nIt is therefore natural to use the same approach for scripts: put them in UTXOs, and reference them using reference inputs.\nThere are a few possible alternatives for where to store reference scripts in outputs.\nIn principle, we could add an \"inline scripts\" extension that allowed scripts themselves to be used in the address field instead of script hashes. We could then use such scripts as reference scripts.\nHowever, this approach suffers from a major confusion about the functional role of the script. You would only be able to provide a reference script that also controlled the spending of the output. This is clearly not what you want: the reference script could be anything, perhaps a script only designed for use in quite specific circumstances; whereas in many cases the user will likely want to retain control over the output with a simple public key.\nWith inline datums, we could put reference scripts in the datum field of outputs.\nThis approach has two problems. First, there is a representation confusion: we would need some way to know that a particular datum contained a reference script. We could do this implicitly, but it would be better to have an explicit marker.\nSecondly, this prevents having an output which is locked by a script that needs a datum and has a reference script in it. While this is a more unusual situation, it's not out of the question. For example, a group of users might want to use a Plutus-based multisig script to control the UTXO with a reference script in it.\nA new field is the simplest solution: it avoids these problems because the new field clearly has one specific purpose, and we do not overload the meanings of the other fields.\nThis proposal gives people a clear incentive to put large amounts (i.e. kilobytes) of data in outputs as reference scripts.\nThis is essentially the same problem which is faced in CIP-32, and we can take the same stance. We don't want to bloat the UTXO set unnecessarily, but we already have mechanisms for limiting that (in the form of the min UTXO value), and these should work transparently for reference scripts as they will for inline datums.\nWe don't strictly need to change the script context. We could simply omit any information about reference scripts carried by outputs. This would mean that we don't need to change the interface.\nWe don't have obvious use cases for the information about reference scripts, but the community may come up with use cases, and our general policy is to try and include as much information about the transaction as we can, unless there is a good reason not to.\nWe also have the question of what to do about old scripts. We can't really present the information about reference scripts to them in a faithful way, there is nowhere to put the information. We could omit the information entirely, but this is dangerous in a different way. Omitting information may lead scripts to make assumptions about the transaction that are untrue; for this reason we prefer not to silently omit information as a general principle. That leaves us only one option: reject transactions where we would have to present information about reference scripts to old scripts.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This CIP specifies a process for proposing changes to Plutus Core, its builtins, and its interface to the Cardano ledger. It gives a taxonomy of typical changes, and explains how these changes may be made, which in some cases requires a CIP. It introduces the 'Plutus' CIP category for tracking these.\nThe Plutus Core language, its builtins, and its interface to the ledger are all likely to evolve significantly over time. There are many reasons for this:\nThis CIP gives a taxonomy of changes, explains how such changes might be implemented in Cardano, and prescribes processes for proposing such changes.\nThis CIP assumes general familiarity with Plutus Core and the Cardano ledger, but we give some brief background here.\nPlutus Core is a script language used in the Cardano ledger. For the purposes of this document, Plutus Core consists of various language constructs, and also builtin types and functions.\nPlutus Core has a number of builtin types, such as integers, and builtin functions, such as integer addition. Builtin functions provide access to functionality that would be difficult or expensive to implement using the basic constructs of Plutus Core, which is otherwise little more than the untyped lambda calculus. Builtin functions can operate only over builtin types or arbitrary Plutus Core terms treated opaquely. Builtin types come with a size metric which is used by costing functions. For example, the size metric for integers returns the bit-size of the integer.\nThe performance of Plutus Core scripts has two components: how expensive the script actually is to run (real performance) and how expensive we say it is to run in the ledger (model performance).\nModel performance is calculated by costing evaluation in abstract resource units (\"exunits\") of CPU and memory. Individual steps of evaluation are costed, and builtin functions must also come with a costing function that provides costing information for them. The costing function for a builtin function is a mathematical function which takes the sizes of the arguments (as computed by their size metrics), and returns an estimate of the budget that will be used to perform that function. For example, the costing function for addition says that the CPU and memory costs are both proportional to the maximum of the sizes of the input integers (with some appropriate constants).\nDetermining costing functions is done empirically, by running the function in question against a large number of inputs and choosing a costing function that fits the data well.\nPlutus Core has a language version (LV). This is the version of the Plutus Core programming language itself, and it controls e.g. which constructs are available in the language. Changing any of the features which are guarded by the language version requires a new language version to be supported by the chain. Note that changing the set of builtin types or functions does not require a new language version; any individual Plutus Core language version is compatible with any set of builtin types and functions.\nDepending on the type of change, a major or minor bump to the language version may be required. The following table shows typical examples.\nSince we always need a new Plutus Core langauge version for any change to the language, in the rest of this document we will focus on the introduction of a new langauge version as the proxy for changes to the language.\nThe Cardano ledger recognizes various kinds of scripts identified by language. This language tag is the only way that the ledger has to distinguish between different types of script. Hence if we require different behaviour, we need a new language. We refer to these languages as ledger languages (LLs).\nPart of the specification of a language in the ledger is how scripts of that language are run, what arguments they are passed, how those arguments are structured, etc. We refer to this as the ledger-script interface.\nBecause we want to occasionally change e.g. the ledger-script interface for Plutus Core scripts, this means we need several ledger languages which all run scripts written in Plutus Core.2 All Plutus Core ledger languages which are used in the ledger must be supported forever, in order to be able to validate the history of the chain.\nLedger languages also have an associated subset of the protocol parameters. These parameters provide the ability to control some aspects of evaluation without a software update. The most notable example is a set of parameters which parameterize the costing of program execution. Hence, a different Plutus Core ledger language can have a different set of costing protocol parameters.\nWe can change the behaviour of ledger languages in a backwards compatible way with new protocol versions. This ensures that the new behaviour only becomes available at a particular time in the history of the chain.\nOverall the combination of ledger language and protocol version controls:\nThis document considers the following types of change:\nChanges to Plutus Core can be released onto Cardano in four ways, with ascending levels of difficulty:\nIntuitively, these correspond to how compatible the change is.\nThe following table lists, for each type of change in \"Types of change\", what kind of release it requires.\nThis CIP deals with the types of change listed in \"Types of change\". That list aims to cover the most typical changes to Plutus Core, but it is not exhaustive. CIPs which do not propose changes in the list but whose authors believe they significantly affect Plutus Core should nonetheless be assigned to the Plutus category.\nAdditionally, there is significant overlap with the Ledger category around the ledger-script interface and the protocol parameters. CIPs which change these parts of Cardano should generally use the Plutus category and not the Ledger category, although the Editors may ask the Ledger reviewers to comment.\nThe following table gives the current set of reviewers for Plutus CIPs.\nThis proposal requires that some of the changes listed in \"Types of change\" (specified below) should:\nThe additional process mostly takes the form of additional information that should be present in the CIP before it moves to particular stages.\nThe requirement to propose a change via a CIP is, as all CIPs are, advisory. In exceptional circumstances or where swift action is required, we expect that changes may still be made without following this process. In such circumstances, a retrospective CIP SHOULD be made after the fact to record the changes and the rationale for them.\nChanges that require a CIP do not have to each be in an individual CIP, they can be included in batches or in other CIPs. So, for example, a single CIP could propose multiple new builtin functions, or a CIP proposing a change to the ledger could also propose a change to the ledger-script interface.\nAll changes that require a CIP SHOULD adhere to the following generic process.\nIn order to move to Proposed status:\nplutus\nplutus\nProposals for additions to the set of Plutus Core builtins SHOULD be proposed in a CIP and SHOULD adhere to the following additional process.\nIn order to move to Proposed status:\nThe Rationale of a CIP should always be a clear argument for why the CIP should be adopted. In this case we recommend including:\nProtocol parameter updates that affect Plutus Core should be proposed in the Ledger category and following its processes. The only additional process required is review by the Plutus reviewers.\nThis CIP does not require any process for proposing performance changes.\nA \"bug fix\" is a change to behaviour where:\nIn this case the fix may be submitted directly to the plutus repository and is NOT required to go through the CIP process. It must still be released as appropriate. For example, if a bug fix changes behaviour, it will have to wait for a new Plutus Core ledger language.\nplutus\nProposals for other additions, removals, or changes to behaviour of any part of Plutus Core or its builtins SHOULD be proposed in a CIP.\nNot being able to make removals or changes to behaviour without a LL is quite painful. For example, it means that we cannot just fix bugs in the semantics: we must remain bug-for-bug compatible with any given LL.\nIt is tempting to think that if we can show that a particular behaviour has never been used in the history of the chain, then changing it is backwards-compatible, since it won t change the validation of any of the actual chain. However, this is sadly untrue.\nSo even if a behaviour is obscure, we cannot just change it.\nChanging the binary format in a backwards compatible way may mean that binary scripts which previously would have been invalid might now deserialize correctly into a program.\nThere is a worry here: scripts which fail execution (a phase 2 validation failure) actually get posted on the chain as failures. We must be careful not to turn any such failures into successes, otherwise we could break history.\nHowever, we do not need to worry in this case, since checking that a script deserializes properly is a phase 1 validation check, so no scripts will be posted as failures due to failing to deserialize, so we cannot break any such postings by making deserialization more lenient.\nPerformance changes must be carefully managed in order to avoid the possibility of an accidental hard fork.\nConsider an example of improving performance. The interpreter gets 50 faster (real performance), which is released as a software update. Now, we want to lower the cost model parameters (model performance) so that users will be charged fewer resources for their scripts.\nHowever, the parameter change means that scripts which previously would have exceeded the transaction/block limit become acceptable. The parameter change is not itself a hard fork, because all the nodes accept the new parameters by consensus. But if the model performance tracks real performance well, then nodes which have not adopted the software update may have issues with the real performance of these newly allowed scripts! In the worst case, they might suffer resource exhaustion, preventing them from following the new chain, which is tantamount to a hard fork.\nThis is a relatively unlikely scenario, since it requires a situation where nodes are close enough to their resource limits that an (effective) regression in real performance of scripts can push them over the edge. Nonetheless, the cautious approach is to not perform such parameter updates until we are sure that all nodes are using a version with the required software update, i.e. after the protocol version has been bumped in a hard fork.\nConversely, if (for some reason) we needed to regress the real performance of the interpreter, we should only do this after all the nodes have accepted a regression in model performance (increasing the cost model parameters).\nBuiltin functions in Plutus Core are implemented via Haskell functions. Often these implementations come from somewhere else, e.g. a cryptography library written in C.\nIt is vitally important that these libraries are trustworthy. The Plutus Core package (and hence its dependencies) are linked into the Cardano node. A buffer overrun vulnerability in the implementation of a builtin function could therefore become an attack on a node.\nWe expect additions to builtins to be particularly common, and to have lots of interest from the community.\nHowever, the process of adding new builtins is not totally straightforward, due in particular to the need to find a good implementation and to cost it. Surfacing these difficulties quickly is a key goal of this process.\nFinally, builtins are a comparatively structured extension point for the language. In comparison, proposals for changes to Plutus Core itself are likely to be much more heterogeneous.\nLedger languages incur a large maintenance cost. Each one must continue to work, perfectly, in perpetuity. Furthermore, they may need their own, independent set of cost model protocol parameters, etc.\nSo it is very desirable to keep the number of ledger languages down. The simplest way to do this is to batch changes, and only release a new ledger language occasionally.\nThis CIP requires the acceptance of the Plutus team, which it has in virtue of its authorship.\nNo implementation is required.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\nSee \"Are backwards-compatible binary format changes really safe?\".\nThe Plutus Core family of ledger languages are sometimes referred to as the Plutus Core ledger language versions, and named as such (\"PlutusV1\", \"PlutusV2\" etc.) although they actually entirely distinct languages from the perspective of the ledger. In this document we will use the more precise language and refer to them just as distinct ledger languages.\nThe binary format change is backwards compatible unless it breaches the limit of how many builtin functions or types can be encoded, in which case that must be changed, forcing a new LL.\nSee \"Why do performance changes require extra steps?\".\nSee \"Why do performance changes require extra steps?\".\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

This CIP details the registration transaction format. This is a revised version of the original CIP-15 | Registration Transaction Metadata Format.\nCardano uses a sidechain for its treasury system (\"Catalyst\") and for other voting purposes. One of the desirable properties of this sidechain is that even if its safety is compromised, it doesn't cause loss of funds on the main Cardano chain. To achieve this, instead of using your wallet's recovery phrase on the sidechain, we need to use a brand new \"voting key\".\nHowever, since 1 ADA = 1 vote, a user needs to associate their mainnet ADA to their new voting key. This can be achieved through a registration transaction.\nIn addition, to encourage participation by a broader range of ADA holders, it should be possible to delegate one's rights to vote to (possibly multiple) representatives and/or expert voters. Such delegations will still be able to receive Catalyst rewards.\nWe therefore need a registration transaction that serves three purposes:\nNote: This schema does not attempt to differentiate delegations from direct registrations, as the two options have exactly the same format. It also does not distinguish between delegations that are made as \"private\" arrangements (proxy votes) from those that are made by delegating to representatives who promote themselves publicly.

In this document, we will use the term 'delegations' to refer to all these possibilities.\nA registration transaction is a regular Cardano transaction with a specific transaction metadata associated with it.\nNotably, there should be five entries inside the metadata map:\nA delegation assigns (a portion of) the ADA controlled by one or more UTxOs on mainnet to the voting key in the sidechain as voting power.

A deregistration with these metadata will be considered valid if the following conditions hold:\nTo produce the witness field in case of a staking public key, the CBOR representation of a map containing a single entry with key 61286 and the deregistration metadata map in the format above is formed, designated here as sign_data. This data is signed with the staking key as follows: first, the blake2b-256 hash of sign_data is obtained. This hash is then signed using the Ed25519 signature algorithm. The witness metadata entry is added to the transaction under key 61285 as a CBOR map with a single entry that consists of the integer key 1 and signature as obtained above as the byte array value.\nsign_data\nsign_data\nSee the schema file.\nSee test vector file.\nThis method has been used since Fund 2. For future fund iterations, a new method making use of time-lock scripts may be introduced as described below.\nRecall: Cardano uses the UTXO model so to completely associate a wallet's balance with a voting key (i.e. including enterprise addresses), we would need to associate every payment key to a voting key individually. Although there are attempts at this (see [CIP-0008]), the resulting data structure is a little excessive for on-chain metadata (which we want to keep small)\nGiven the above, we choose to associate staking credentials with voting keys. At the moment, the only supported staking credential is a staking key. Since most Cardano wallets only use base addresses for Shelley wallet types, in most cases this should perfectly match the user's wallet.\nThe voting power that is associated with each delegated voting key is derived from the user's total voting power as follows.\nThis ensures that the voter's total voting power is never accidentally reduced through poor choices of weights, and that all voting powers are exact ADA.\nA future change of the Catalyst system may make use of a time-lock script to commit ADA on the mainnet for the duration of a voting period. The voter registration metadata in this method will not need an association with a staking credential. Therefore, the staking_credential map entry and the registration_witness payload with key 61285 will no longer be required.\nstaking_credential\nregistration_witness\nFund 3 added the reward_address inside the key_registration field.\nreward_address\nkey_registration\nFund 4:\nnonce\nsign_data\nsign_data\nIt was planned that since Fund 4, registration_signature and the staking_pub_key entry inside the key_registration field will be deprecated.

    "prompt": "CIP0037?",
    "completion": "The pledge should be used to calculate the saturation point of a pool: setting a maximum delegation proportional to pledge.\nCurrently Cardano has been plagued with an ever increasing amount of single entity Stake Pool Operators (SPO) creating multiple pools. The pools that are known to be operated by single entity SPOs account for just 18.72 of the total stake and 50 of the total stake can be attributed to at least 23 single entities (as of 3rd Dec 2021).\nThe vision of Cardano is that it everyone should be able to have the opportunity to be able to run a stake pool regardless of their financial capabilities and this is even more important for developing countries.\nThe issue we're currently facing is that many SPOs have been able to exploit a loophole that has allowed them to use their influence to create many sub-pools without any restrictions. As the size of their pools grow, instead of honouring the saturation limits already in place, they are bypassing them by creating more sub-pools. From a technical point, it is theoretically possible for a single entity to run enough stake pools to control more then 50 of the total stake.\nWhile unlikely, the system does not take into account external influences (eg. political) that could harm the system. Shelly has been active for less then 2 years and we are already seeing the risks on a small scale. As real world adoption continues, there could be situations in the next decade that could jeopardise the decentralisation of Cardano. One example could be that a political party could run a ISPO (Initial Stake Pool Offering) on a mass scale. Seeing as Cardano has the potential to be used for voting (even at a political level), the integrity of Cardano could be questioned if political parties controlled stake pools with large shares of total stake.\nThe pledge used in a pool was meant to show how serious a SPO is and how much \"skin in the game\" they had. The idea was that if they have more pledge, they have more to lose if something goes wrong. This seems to have lost it's meaning as SPOs that already have a dominating position have created many sub-pools. Some have split up their pledge evenly, some have next to no pledge and have gained high amounts of stake through influential means. This has not only reduced the security of Cardano, but has also lost the meaning of having pledge in the pool.\nFor example, a SPO might have a pledge of 30,000 ADA across 10 pools, while another SPO might have 1,000,000 pledge but only has 1 pool with a small amount of active stake. Seeing as the SPO with 1M pledge has more overall, they have more to lose and should be trusted more. Since there is no technical advantage to having a high pledge, the meaning and purpose of a pledge is redundant.\nTo make the pledge a meaningful metric that is fair to all SPOs and aligns with the core values of Cardano, the pledge should be used to calculate the saturation point of a pool. This will mean that SPOs, no matter how many pools they operate, will have a maximum saturation based on their total pledge. For example, if a pool operates a single pool and wanted to open up another pool with the same amount of stake, they will have to assign the equal amount of pledge against that new pool. If a pool wishes to up their saturation point, they will need to assign a higher amount of pledge.\nThis proposal has had active discussions for over 6 months and is now waiting for a review from IOG to provide feedback on the feasibility and soundness of the approach.\nThis CIP should be considered a medium priority as it directly impacts the health and growth of the Cardano ecosystem. Large Cardano pools have had several years to take advantage of the lack of oversight and have control of a large portion of mining operations. This continued lack of restrictions will further damage the trust and reliability of the framework.\nTimelines around the implementation of the CIP will depend on urgency, however its implementation should be trivial as there are no new parameters required or risks involved. Further this CIP from a high-level aspect only requires an update to the existing algorithm. From an external context, the CIP will require trivial updates as it should be self-contained in cardano-node.\nFor this to be able to work, there firstly needs to be an upper limit and a lower limit. The K parameter can still be used as the upper saturation limit of a single pool. As in, if a SPO has enough pledge assigned to a single pool, that pool will be able to run at the maximum saturation point of K. The lower limit is in place to safe guard small SPOs and allow them to grow.\nAn example of how Dynamic Saturation would be calculated:\n500,000 ADA Pledged = Saturation point at 100 of K\n250,000 ADA Pledged = Saturation point at 50 of K\n125,000 ADA Pledged = Saturation point at 25 of K\n62,500 ADA Pledged = Saturation point at 12.5 of K\nTo not penalise small pools, there should be a lower limit saturation point, such as 10 of K. Based on this, a pool with a pledge of 50,000 has the same saturation point as a pool with 25,000 pledge, both being 10 of K. This will allow smaller pools to still have some growth potential.\nThe only way a pool can receive more stake across all their pools without impacting their rewards is to increase their total pledge.\nExample with SPO of 1,000,000 Pledge with current k implementation:\nExample with SPO of 1,000,000 Pledge with Dynamic Saturation:\nAs we can see above with the current implementation of K, a pool owner can split the pool and double their delegators active stake (or however many times they split).\nThe Dynamic Saturation method caps the pools so that the amount of total stake across all pools is the same no matter how much they split up their pledge and the only benefit will be the extra fee collected (340 ADA) per pool.\nThis will mean that the saturation metric will have a direct corelation to an SPOs total pledge.\nAfter some discussions among the community and some help from https://github.com/cffls, the below code example has been proposed for how the dynamic saturation could work.\nlet lovelace = 1000000; function calc_sat(pledge){ k = 500; e = 0.2; l = 125; total_supply = 33719282563 * lovelace; orig_sat = total_supply / k; new_sat = orig_sat * Math.max(e, min(1 / k, pledge / orig_sat * l)); final_sat = max(new_sat, orig_sat); console.log(`pledge: ${pledge / lovelace}, sat: ${final_sat / lovelace}`); } function max(val1, val2){ if(val1 < val2){ return val1; } return val2; } function min(val1, val2){ if(val1 > val2){ return val1; } return val2; } calc_sat(50000 * lovelace); calc_sat(100000 * lovelace); calc_sat(150000 * lovelace); calc_sat(250000 * lovelace); calc_sat(500000 * lovelace); calc_sat(750000 * lovelace); calc_sat(1000000 * lovelace); calc_sat(2000000 * lovelace);\nlet lovelace = 1000000; function calc_sat(pledge){ k = 500; e = 0.2; l = 125; total_supply = 33719282563 * lovelace; orig_sat = total_supply / k; new_sat = orig_sat * Math.max(e, min(1 / k, pledge / orig_sat * l)); final_sat = max(new_sat, orig_sat); console.log(`pledge: ${pledge / lovelace}, sat: ${final_sat / lovelace}`); } function max(val1, val2){ if(val1 < val2){ return val1; } return val2; } function min(val1, val2){ if(val1 > val2){ return val1; } return val2; } calc_sat(50000 * lovelace); calc_sat(100000 * lovelace); calc_sat(150000 * lovelace); calc_sat(250000 * lovelace); calc_sat(500000 * lovelace); calc_sat(750000 * lovelace); calc_sat(1000000 * lovelace); calc_sat(2000000 * lovelace);\nResults:\n[Log] pledge: 50000, sat: 13487713.0252 [Log] pledge: 100000, sat: 13487713.0252 [Log] pledge: 150000, sat: 18750000 [Log] pledge: 250000, sat: 31250000 [Log] pledge: 500000, sat: 62500000 [Log] pledge: 750000, sat: 67438565.126 [Log] pledge: 1000000, sat: 67438565.126 [Log] pledge: 2000000, sat: 67438565.126\n[Log] pledge: 50000, sat: 13487713.0252 [Log] pledge: 100000, sat: 13487713.0252 [Log] pledge: 150000, sat: 18750000 [Log] pledge: 250000, sat: 31250000 [Log] pledge: 500000, sat: 62500000 [Log] pledge: 750000, sat: 67438565.126 [Log] pledge: 1000000, sat: 67438565.126 [Log] pledge: 2000000, sat: 67438565.126\nSince a single entity SPO only has a certain amount of ADA they can pledge, they will eventually hit their saturation point no matter how many pools they create. The only way they can add more delegators is to increase their pledge. Once they run out of pledge and reach their saturation point, the delegators will have no choice but to move to another SPO and increase decentralisation.\nIn the above example, the base pledge of 500,000 ADA should be set as a parameter that can be adjusted in the future. E.g, if it is found that it is too low or too high to gain 100 saturation, it can be adjusted in the same way k can be adjusted.\nOne of the questions raised by the community was, will the lower limit stop the growth of small pools if it is set at a level where they can't reach the expected annual 5 return on ADA. This case could be handled a few ways, but the main aim would be to keep it at a sustainable amount for small pools.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

TxOut). While Plutus already provides built-in for hashing data-structure (e.g. sha2_256 :: BuiltinByteString - BuiltinByteString), it does not provide generic ways of serialising some data type to BuiltinByteString.\nTxOut\nsha2_256 :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nIn an attempt to pursue our work, we have implemented an on-chain library (plutus-cbor) for encoding data-types as structured CBOR / RFC 8949 in a relatively efficient way (although still quadratic, it is as efficient as it can be with Plutus' available built-ins) and measured the memory and CPU cost of encoding TxOut in a script validator on-chain.\nTxOut\nThe above graph shows the memory and CPU costs relative against a baseline, of encoding a TxOut using plutus-cbor in function of the number of assets present in that TxOut. The costs on the y-axis are relative to the maximum execution budgets (as per mainnet's parameters, December 2021) allowed for a single script execution. As can be seen, this is of linear complexity, i.e. O(n) in terms of the number of assets. These results can be reproduced using the encoding-cost executable in our repository.\nTxOut\nplutus-cbor\nTxOut\nNote that we have also calculated similar costs for ada-only TxOut, in function of the number of TxOut which is about twice as worse but of similar linear shape.\nTxOut\nTxOut\nWe we can see on the graph, the cost is manageable for a small number of assets (or equivalently, a small number of outputs) but rapidly becomes limiting. Ideally, we would prefer the transaction size to be the limiting factor when it comes to the number of outputs we can handle in a single validation.\nBesides, in our discussions with the Marlowe team, we also discovered that they shared a similar problem when it came to serialising merkleized ASTs.\nUnderneath it all, it seems that it would be beneficial to have a new built-in at our disposal to serialise any Plutus BuiltinData to BuiltinByteString such that validators could leverage more optimized implementations and bytestring builders via built-ins than what's available on-chain, hopefully reducing the overall memory and CPU costs.\nBuiltinData\nBuiltinByteString\nWe define a new Plutus built-in function with the following type signature:\nserialiseData :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinByteString\nserialiseData :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinByteString\nBehind the scene, we expect this function to use a well-known encoding format to ease construction of such serialisation off-chain (in particular, for non-Haskell off-chain contract codes). A natural choice of binary data format in this case is CBOR which is:\nFurthermore, the Plutus' ecosystem already provides a quite opinionated implementation of a CBOR encoder for built-in Data. For the sake of documenting it as part of this proposal, we provide here-below the CDDL specification of that existing implementation:\nData\nplutus_data = constr<plutus_data> / { * plutus_data => plutus_data } / [ * plutus_data ] / big_int / bounded_bytes constr<a> = #6.121([]) / #6.122([a]) / #6.123([a, a]) / #6.124([a, a, a]) / #6.125([a, a, a, a]) / #6.126([a, a, a, a, a]) / #6.127([a, a, a, a, a, a]) ; similarly for tag range: #6.1280 .. #6.1400 inclusive / #6.102([uint, [* a]]) big_int = int / big_uint / big_nint big_uint = #6.2(bounded_bytes) big_nint = #6.3(bounded_bytes) bounded_bytes = bytes .size (0..64)\nplutus_data = constr<plutus_data> / { * plutus_data => plutus_data } / [ * plutus_data ] / big_int / bounded_bytes constr<a> = #6.121([]) / #6.122([a]) / #6.123([a, a]) / #6.124([a, a, a]) / #6.125([a, a, a, a]) / #6.126([a, a, a, a, a]) / #6.127([a, a, a, a, a, a]) ; similarly for tag range: #6.1280 .. #6.1400 inclusive / #6.102([uint, [* a]]) big_int = int / big_uint / big_nint big_uint = #6.2(bounded_bytes) big_nint = #6.3(bounded_bytes) bounded_bytes = bytes .size (0..64)\nNOTE: The CDDL specification is extracted from the wider alonzo_cddl specification of the Cardano ledger.\nThe Data type is a recursive data-type, so costing it properly is a little tricky. The Plutus source code defines an instance of ExMemoryUsage for Data with the following interesting note:\nData\nExMemoryUsage\nData\nThis accounts for the number of nodes in a Data object, and also the sizes of the contents of the nodes. This is not ideal, but it seems to be the best we can do. At present this only comes into play for 'equalsData', which is implemented using the derived implementation of '==' [...].\nData\nWe propose to re-use this instance to define a cost model linear in the size of data defined by this instance. What remains is to find a proper coefficient and offset for that linear model. To do so, we can benchmark the execution costs of encoding arbitrarily generated Data of various sizes, and retro-fit the cost into a linear model (provided that the results are still attesting for that type of model).\nData\nBenchmarking and costing serialiseData was done in this PR according to this strategy. As the benchmark is not very uniform, because some cases of Data \"structures\" differ in CPU time taken to process, the linear model is used as an upper bound and thus conservatively overestimating actual costs.\nserialiseData\nData\nEasy to implement as it reuses existing code of the Plutus codebase;\nSuch built-in is generic enough to also cover a wider set of use-cases, while nicely fitting ours;\nFavoring manipulation of structured Data is an appealing alternative to many ByteString manipulation use-cases;\nData\nByteString\nCBOR as encoding is a well-known and widely used standard in Cardano, existing tools can be used;\nThe hypothesis on the cost model here is that serialisation cost would be proportional to the ExMemoryUsage for Data; which means, given the current implementation, proportional to the number and total memory usage of nodes in the Data tree-like structure.\nExMemoryUsage\nData\nData\nBenchmarking the costs of serialising TxOut values between plutus-cbor and cborg confirms cborg and the existing encodeData's implementation in Plutus as a great candidate for implementing the built-in:\nTxOut\nResults can be reproduced with the plutus-cbor benchmark.\nWe have identified that the cost mainly stems from concatenating bytestrings; so possibly, an alternative to this proposal could be a better way to concatenate (or to cost) bytestrings (Builders in Plutus?)\nIf costing for BuiltinData is unsatisfactory, maybe we want have only well-known input types, e.g. TxIn, TxOut, Value and so on..

This function requires a (random) seed, which can also be stored and re-used to ensure that whenever a client employs a dApp or a Wallet, the same key pair is generated consistently, even if the browser or mobile app is restarted. The public key will be used as an identifier for the torrent-based peer discovery. When this identifier is shared through methods like QR codes or links, it needs to be compliant to the following Cardano Uri Scheme (CIP-0013):\nweb+cardano://connect/v1?identifier=<public_key>\nweb+cardano://connect/v1?identifier=<public_key>\nThe idea of using WebTorrent trackers instead of signaling servers for peer discovery was already mentioned in Aug 2018 by Chris McCormick: \"I've also been tinkering with WebTorrent. [...] Working with this technology made me realise something the other day: it's now possible to host back-end services, or \"servers\" inside browser tabs. [...] So anyway, I've made this weird thing to enable developers to build \"backend\" services which run in browser tabs\"\nMcCormick's idea has been developed and open sourced as a library called bugout (MIT).\nFor this proof of concept we wrote two small pieces of software:\nThe whole code is provided within this demo implementation that also contains a step-by-step guide.\nThe dApp consists of a standard HTML5 template including the following lines of code:\n<script src=\"https://chr15m.github.io/bugout/bugout.min.js\"></script> <script> var bugout = new Bugout({ seed: localStorage[\"poc-server-seed\"], announce: [ 'udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337/announce', 'udp://open.tracker.cl:1337/announce', 'udp://opentracker.i2p.rocks:6969/announce', 'https://opentracker.i2p.rocks:443/announce', 'wss://tracker.files.fm:7073/announce', 'wss://spacetradersapi-chatbox.herokuapp.com:443/announce', 'ws://tracker.files.fm:7072/announce' ] });

    "completion": "Support ECDSA and Schnorr signatures over the SECP256k1 curve in Plutus Core; specifically, allow validation of such signatures as builtins. These builtins work over BuiltinByteStrings.\nBuiltinByteString\nSignature schemes based on the SECP256k1 curve are common in the blockchain industry; a notable user of these is Bitcoin. Supporting signature schemes which are used in other parts of the industry provides an interoperability benefit: we can verify signatures produced by other systems as they are today, without requiring other people to produce signatures specifically for us. This not only provides us with improved interoperability with systems based on Bitcoin, but also compatibility with other interoperability systems, such as Wanchain and Renbridge, which use SECP256k1 signatures for verification. Lastly, if we can verify Schnorr signatures, we can also verify Schnorr-compatible multi or threshold signatures, such as MuSig2 or Frost.\nTwo new builtin functions would be provided:\nThese would be based on secp256k1, a reference implementation of both kinds of signature scheme in C. This implementation would be called from Haskell using direct bindings to C. These bindings would be defined in cardano-base, using its existing DSIGN interface, with new builtins in Plutus Core on the basis of the DSIGN interface for both schemes.\nsecp256k1\ncardano-base\nDSIGN\nDSIGN\nThe builtins would be costed as follows: ECDSA signature verification has constant cost, as the message, verification key and signature are all fixed-width; Schnorr signature verification is instead linear in the message length, as this can be arbitrary, but as the length of the verification key and signature are constant, the costing will be constant in both.\nMore specifically, Plutus would gain the following primitive operations:\nverifyEcdsaSecp256k1Signature :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinBool\nverifySchnorrSecp256k1Signature :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinBool\nBoth functions take parameters of a specific part of the signature scheme, even though they are all encoded as BuiltinByteStrings. In order, for both functions, these are:\nBuiltinByteString\nThe two different schemes handle deserialization internally: specifically, there is a distinction made between 'external' representations, which are expected as arguments, and 'internal' representations, used only by the implementations themselves. This creates different expecations for each argument for both of these schemes; we describe these below.\nFor the ECDSA signature scheme, the requirements are as follows. Note that these differ from the serialization used by Bitcoin, as the serialisation of signatures uses DER-encoding, which result in variable size signatures up to 72 bytes (instead of the 64 byte encoding we describe in this document).\nsecp256k1_ec_pubkey_serialize\nSECP256K1_EC_COMPRESSED\n0x02\n0x03\nverifyEcdsaSecp256k1Signature\nsecp256k1_ecdsa_serialize_compact\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ r <32 bytes> │ s <32 bytes> ┃ ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ <--------- signature ---------->\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ r <32 bytes> │ s <32 bytes> ┃ ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ <--------- signature ---------->\nFor the Schnorr signature scheme, we have the following requirements, as described in the requirements for BIP-340:\nsecp256k1_xonly_pubkey_serialize\ns\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ R <32 bytes> │ s <32 bytes> ┃ ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ <--------- signature ---------->\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ R <32 bytes> │ s <32 bytes> ┃ ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ <--------- signature ---------->\nThe builtin operations will error with a descriptive message if given inputs that don't correspond to the constraints above, return False if the signature fails to verify the input given the key, and True otherwise.\nFalse\nTrue\nWe consider the implementation trustworthy: secp256k1 is the reference implementation for both signature schemes, and is already being used in production by Bitcoin. Specifically, ECDSA signatures over the SECP256k1 curve were used by Bitcoin before Taproot, while Schnorr signatures over the same curve have been used since Taproot.\nsecp256k1\nAn alternative approach could be to provide low-level primitives, which would allow any signature scheme (not just the ones under consideration here) to be implemented by whoever needs them. While this approach is certainly more flexible, it has two significant drawbacks:\nIt may be possible that some set of primitive can avoid both of these issues (for example, the suggestions in this CIP); in the meantime, providing direct support for commonly-used schemes such as these is worthwhile.\nAt the Plutus Core level, implementing this proposal induces no backwards-incompatibility: the proposed new primitives do not break any existing functionality or affect any other builtins. Likewise, at levels above Plutus Core (such as PlutusTx), no existing functionality should be affected.\nPlutusTx\nOn-chain, this requires a hard fork.\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "Improving decentralization is absolutely necessary for the long term health and growth of the Cardano ecosystem. The current reward formula has resulted in a stable but stagnant level of decentralization. With the benefit of hindsight over the last year the intent of (a0,k)(a0, k)(a0,k) has not resulted in the desired decentralization outcome. This CIP provides the justification, methods, metrics, and implementation for an improvement program to increase decentralization of the Cardano network.\nThe proposed reward equation retains the function of kkk for diminishing rewards based on stake and enforces diminishing rewards based on pledge leverage, LLL. The proposed equation enforces a set of principles to ensure stakeholders of dramatically different size can all achieve the same maximum yield. The yield ceiling feature prevents the formation of two classes of stakeholders and removes some of the benefits of centralization. The economic motivations of the largest stakeholders will be aligned with decentralization, reward diversification, fault tolerance, and ensuring the sybil protection of the entire community.\nWarning Conflict of Interest Declaration\nThe author is employed full time as a Research Assistant Professor in Nuclear Engineering at the University of Tennessee. The author earns no revenue from the Cardano ecosystem, does not operate a stake pool, is not seeking Cardano Foundation stakepool delegation support, is not seeking Catalyst funding support, and owns 25k ADA delegated to the BALNC stake pool ($drliesenfelt).\nImproving decentralization is absolutely necessary for the long term health and growth of the Cardano ecosystem. The current reward formula has resulted in a stable but stagnant level of decentralization. The motivation is to provide the justification, methods, metrics, and implementation schedule for an improvement program to increase decentralization of the Cardano network.\nKKK and a0a0a0 are input parameters to the reward formulation designed to promote decentralization. The original intention for parameter kkk was for it to set a soft-cap on a pool s size and thereby encourage the system to converge toward kkk pools of equal size delivering equal return per unit of stake for all delegates. In the ideal world this would mean kkk pools that are roughly equally saturated producing a roughly equal proportion of the blocks [1]. An underlying assumption was that one entity would run only one pool and design discussions about these parameters have described running multiple pools as a form of Sybil attack [2].\nHowever, the input parameters have not achieved these goals. Currently there are single entities that run 5,10,20 or even 50 separate pools. It is proposed that the average resulting decentralization should be measured based on the stake held by entire entities/groups, rather than a count of individual pools. K-effective is hereby used to measure the average resulting decentralization and is computed using Equation 1. The Nakamoto Coefficient is approximately half of k-effective rounded up to the nearest integer. K-effective provides a higher resolution quantification of network decentralization compared to the Nakamoto Coefficient.\nThe Cardano network currently produces ~21,600 blocks per epoch with ~2400 groups producing between 0 and ~3600 blocks per group. If averaged, approximately 40 equal sized groups would each be creating ~527 blocks per epoch. The historical decentralization of the network shown in Figure 1 has improved from 30.0 in epoch 245 to between 35.0 and 43.0 after epoch 260. This effective decentralization or k-effective is not even close to the 500 figure targeted by the current k=500 parameter. A partial example of the table used to compute k-effective is shown in Figure 2.\n(1) https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/05/parameters-and-decentralization-the-way-ahead/\n(2) https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2018/10/29/preventing-sybil-attacks/\nRef(1)Ref (1)Ref(1)\nFigure 1. Historical k-effective from epoch 245 to present.\nFigure 2. K-effective table.\nTo cite Aggelos Kiayias, Chief Scientist of IOG:\nCentral to the mechanism s behavior are two parameters: kkk and a0a0a0. The k-parameter caps the rewards of pools to 1/k of the total available. The a0a0a0 parameter creates a benefit for pledging more stake into a single pool; adding X amount of pledge to a pool increases its rewards additively by up to a0a0a0*X. This is not to the detriment of other pools; any rewards left unclaimed due to insufficient pledging will be returned to the Cardano s reserves and allocated in the future. [3]\nPaired with the assessment of stake pools performed by the delegates, this mechanism provides the right set of constraints for the system to converge to a configuration of k equal size pools with the maximum amount of pledge possible. [3]\nThe analysis of the current reward formula in [4] equated 1 pool to 1 entity. In the real world 1 entity can choose to delegate to another entity, operate one pool, or operate many pools. This oversight in the original analysis contributed to the proliferation of multipools in defiance of kkk parameter increases.\n(3) https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/13/the-general-perspective-on-staking-in-cardano/\n(4) https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1807/1807.11218.pdf\nFrom 4.1 Our RSS construction of Reward Sharing Schemes for Stake Pools [5] the current rewards equation is:\nRef(2)Ref(2)Ref(2)\nwhere:\nA natural choice is =1/k = 1/k =1/k, where kkk is the target number of pools, and k, k, k, are fixed parameters.\nThe following are current protocol parameters:\nk=500k = 500k=500\n=a0=0.3 = a0 = 0.3 =a0=0.3\nThe a0a0a0 parameter represents the fraction of the rewards (R/(1+a0))(R/(1+a0))(R/(1+a0)) which are not paid out unless all of the stake is pledged. An a0a0a0 of 0.3 ensures that 1.0 - 1.0/(1.0+0.3) = 23 of the total rewards R will be withheld from low pledge fraction pools and returned to the reserve. The effect of this formula is that increased pledge results in retaining more of the available rewards R. However, this benefit is not linear, rather it is drastically biased towards the saturation limit. The =min , \\sigma = min\\\\{ , \\\\} =min , term enforces a reward limit based on kkk. Visualizing the resulting field of outcomes at various pledge amounts from 0.00 to 100.0 is necessary. The red dotted line Max Reward represents the maximum available yield available at the stated network size.\nThe intent of parameters (a0,k)(a0, k)(a0,k) has not been realized. The graph of k-effective shows that increasing kkk from 150 to 500 did not result in a proportional increase to decentralization. The k parameter is currently 500/35=14.29500 / 35 = 14.29500/35=14.29 times larger than the effective decentralization k-effective.\nAnother important determinant of the ability for small pools to compete with larger pools is the mandatory minimum fee (minFee parameter) which is currently 340 . This minimum fee is a higher percentage of the total rewards for a small pool compared to a larger pool. It means that delegator yields will not exceed 95 of a saturated pool delegator yields until the pool has at least 15.0 saturation. This is a significant barrier to entry for small pools.\nBillions of ADA is currently staked in pools with nearly 0 pledge and extremely high leverage. Also, a billion ADA is currently pledged in nearly saturated private pools closed to community delegation. There are very few public pools accepting community delegation with pledge amounts between 5M and 60M and the vast majority of public pools have less than 1M pledge. The following bubble chart shows the distribution of stake as a function of group leverage on a log(Stake) vs log(Leverage) scale. The current pledge incentive mechanism only becomes relevant in a small segment of this chart below a leverage of 10 and above a pledge amount of 10M . The Single Pool Operator Alliance (SPA) is a collective of ~2200 individual pools and pool operators with a collective stake of 5B at an average leverage factor of only 22.\nIn the original design, parameter a0a0a0 represented the influence the operator s pledge had on the desirability of the pool. In other words, more pledge should mean the pool would be more desirable for stake delegation. However the current reward formula has not produced this effect. See Figure 2. With increasing pledge as a proportion of total stake there is little noticeable effect on rewards until very high pledge percentages. These very high pledge percentages are not attainable except by extremely large stakeholders. Furthermore having such a high pledge percentage would defeat the purpose of community staking since the pool would already be saturated when the maximum pledge benefit is earned.\nThe reality of the past 18 months is that pool operators have split pledge across multiple pools because it is more profitable to earn fees (minFee + margin ) than it is to benefit from increasing their pledge to a single pool. The small increase in yield for pools with less than 10M pledge is also much less than the random statistical uncertainty of rewards per epoch. The pledge incentive is currently a statistically unnoticed benefit used only by large private stakeholders. The current reward equation has sacrificed fair egalitarian rewards for an incentive that is not providing Sybil protection as intended.\nThe SundaeSwap Initial Stake Offering (ISO) proved that community delegator stake can be very mobile. More than a couple billion in stake centralized into ISO groups. After realizing the popularity of their ISO resulted in a centralization of the network SundaeSwap launched a Reverse ISO for the benefit of single pools. The RISO temporarily reversed the centralization trend as a billion ADA was delegated to small pools. The Cardano network reached a decentralization factor of 43.22 in epoch 321. After the RISO these decentralization gains reversed because the underlying incentives of the reward formula have not changed. This proves that the community is engaged and their stake is mobile, especially for yield and gains.\nAn intentional design of the current reward equation is to purposefully allow large stakeholders pledging to private pools to earn the maximum possible yields while excluding community delegation. The vast majority of pools with pledge 10 stake saturation have an asymptotic yield currently approaching a maximum yield of 4.25 . A high pledge fraction in a private pool can earn up to the maximum available 5.5 yield, 30 more yield than low pledge community pools.\nThe R/(1+a0)R/(1+a0)R/(1+a0) term guarantees that small pools will not earn the same fraction of the reserve as large pledged pools. Currently, approximately 1.25B is earning full rewards in 19 pools. If left unchanged over time custodial wealth management companies will be able to offer materially higher yields than individuals. Wave financial is an example of a company currently providing this business model to clients. Eternl/ccvalut is introducing multi-signature features to allow many individuals to collectively pledge to pools. Over time this difference results in two different classes of stakeholders and erodes the decentralized self-custodial appeal of Cardano.\nForcing the k-parameter to be radically different from the effective decentralization, k-effective, of the network has resulted in unintended consequences. When k was increased large groups created new pools to retain delegators. If the k-parameter is increased without updating the rewards formula, more large stakeholders will be able to earn full yields by pledging to private pools excluding community delegation.\nLarge differences between k-parameter and the k-effective of the network represents a stress on the current state of the network. More pools under the control of a smaller number of groups does not improve decentralization and in fact takes more time and resources to propagate the blockchain to more relays and nodes. A k-effective of 100.0 with an adjustable k-parameter informed by and leading k-effective is reasonable long term goal. If the k-effective becomes 100.0, it is likely that the Nakamoto Coefficient will be 50.\nPrinciples matter. -CH\nk, k-parameter\nk-effective\nNakamoto Coefficient, Minimum Attack Vector (MAV)\nSybil Attack\nPledge\nPledge Leverage, L\nVRF Score\nPrivate vs Public Stake Pools\nThe proposed reward retains the function of kkk for limiting rewards based on stake and introduces parameter LLL for enforcing reward limits based on pledge leverage. The equation equally balances both reward parameters. The pledge leverage parameter LLL is intended to range from 10,000.0 down to 1.0. An LLL value of 100.0 would require pools to pledge 1.0 of stake and an LLL of 1.0 would require all pools to be 100.0 pledged.\nThe new equation is computationally simple and purposefully does not use logarithms, exponents, or geometric curves. Instead of an incentive based tradeoff between egalitarian rewards and a perceived Sybil resilience the new equation enforces both egalitarian rewards and pledge-based Sybil resilience. A simple flat egalitarian yield ceiling with pledge leverage enforcement for Sybil defense has a profound psychological effect: Stakeholders know there is no way to game the system for yield, either individually or collectively with governance, and pledge is absolutely mandatory. Without any engineered bias Cardano decentralization would converge to the diversity of the underlying community, services, and stakeholder distribution. If this proposal is eventually adopted changes in community diversity, not changes in a formula or parameters, would change decentralization.\nThe LLL parameter will establish a maximum pledge leverage before limiting rewards, similar to the k parameter for pool size. Pledge leverage establishes a different saturation point for each pool based on its pledge. The LLL parameter enforces the principle that growing pledge is absolutely required to support growing delegation. This change will directly align the LLL parameter for protecting the network from Sybil behavior. The pledge leverage factor provides an enforcable limit on sybil actors and their maximum return on invested capital. Pledge will not be a statistically unnoticed slight incentive used only by a handful of large private stakeholders. Community governance to adjust leverage factor LLL would be the preferred mechanism to constrain sybil behavior.\nThe new LLL parameter will range from 10,000.0 to 1.0. The initial value of the maximum pledge leverage ratio a0a0a0 should initially be set conservatively high ( =100.0) and optionally decreased slightly over time to a healthy equilibrium by community governance. At (L=100,k=500)(L=100, k=500)(L=100,k=500) approximately 680k pledge would be required to support a fully saturated pool.\nThe proposed reward formula should be visualized on a linear(yield) vs log(saturation) scale independent of kkk. The chart below shows the field of possible outcomes for various levels of pledge and stake spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude. The effect of LLL becomes obvious, pool saturation will be limited first by pledge amount and then eventually by kkk. A very important feature of this relationship is that 0 pledge will always result in 0 rewards. At L=100.0L=100.0L=100.0 to support a 100.0 saturated stake pool 1.0 pledge will be required.\nThe new equation is purposefully designed so that stakeholders of dramatically different size can all reach the exact same maximum yield. The yield ceiling feature prevents the formation of two classes of stakeholders and removes the economic benefits of custodial centralization. The yield ceiling is the egalitarian reward described but not implemented by the original paper.\nWith the minFee 30 once a pool grows to 0.5 of saturation the intermittent rewards will, on average, provide a competitive yield for delegators at 5.0 . At k=500k=500k=500 and L=100L=100L=100 this corresponds to a pool size 500k with a minimum pledge of only 5k . The yield ceiling is also compatible with a potential future implementation of the Conclave collective stake pool concept. Because of the yield ceiling large collective stake pools will only provide more predictable returns, not a materially larger yield which would compete with smaller independent pools.\nPool ranking scores in wallet browsers have a significant and powerful game theory impact on delegator pool choices, yet it is often overlooked and not transparent in wallets.\nWhen pledge becomes the most important factor for total pool size, lower leverage factors are more desirable. Lists should be sorted by leverage and presented in an descending order with the lowest leverage pools first.\nThe recommended ranking equation starts with the highest score of 10. The pools are down-ranked solely based on leverage, saturation, and fee factors.\n//equation ranking_score = 10 - max{ leverage_factor, saturation_factor } - fee_factor //variables leverage_factor = 10 * (pool_leverage/L)^A saturation_factor = 2 * (pool_stake/(saturation_stake * C))^B fee_factor = D * pool_fee_margin //parameters - A is 2.0, has range (0,10.0), can be tweaked - B is 5.0, has range (0,10.0), can be tweaked - C is 0.9, has range (0,2.0), can be tweaked - D is 50, has range (0-100) ish to be harsh, can be tweaked - pool_leverage = delegation / pledge - pool_stake = pledge + delegation - saturation_stake = total_live_stake/k (e.g. 68M₳ \"soft-cap upper limit\") - pool_fee_margin is in range (0-100)% (fixed fee + margin combined)\n//equation ranking_score = 10 - max{ leverage_factor, saturation_factor } - fee_factor //variables leverage_factor = 10 * (pool_leverage/L)^A saturation_factor = 2 * (pool_stake/(saturation_stake * C))^B fee_factor = D * pool_fee_margin //parameters - A is 2.0, has range (0,10.0), can be tweaked - B is 5.0, has range (0,10.0), can be tweaked - C is 0.9, has range (0,2.0), can be tweaked - D is 50, has range (0-100) ish to be harsh, can be tweaked - pool_leverage = delegation / pledge - pool_stake = pledge + delegation - saturation_stake = total_live_stake/k (e.g. 68M₳ \"soft-cap upper limit\") - pool_fee_margin is in range (0-100)% (fixed fee + margin combined)\nTo evaluate rank using the current reward scheme:\n//current reward scheme only ranking_score = 10 - max{ leverage_factor , saturation_factor } - fee_factor - fixed_fee_factor //variables //if fee = minFee, term drops out //if fee > minFee, term nonzero but loses relevance w/ increased stake //fixed fee matters less to rewards as stake grows, so too here fixed_fee_factor = E * (fee-minFee) / stake //parameters - E is 100, has range (0,100_000), can be tweaked - fee cannot be less than minFee\n//current reward scheme only ranking_score = 10 - max{ leverage_factor , saturation_factor } - fee_factor - fixed_fee_factor //variables //if fee = minFee, term drops out //if fee > minFee, term nonzero but loses relevance w/ increased stake //fixed fee matters less to rewards as stake grows, so too here fixed_fee_factor = E * (fee-minFee) / stake //parameters - E is 100, has range (0,100_000), can be tweaked - fee cannot be less than minFee\nA leverage-based ranking system will create interesting pool free market business dynamics. It's envisioned a pool will undergo \"business life-cycles\" based on price supply and demand (fees) and leverage (pledge raising to grow the business) as described below. Currently, the yield-based pool ranking creates a market based on fees (driving yield), but not leverage, thus pools can grow indefinitely with no \"leverage ranking costs\".\nA Leverage-Based Pool's Life-Cycle\nWith the need to grow pledge to grow pool size and regain better ranking, the business cycle is cyclical indefinitely until the pool reaches max saturation based on the k-parameter.\nAn oversaturation attack occurs when a large stakeholder would significantly oversaturate a pool with the intention of pressuring current and future delegators to select a new pool. Limiting pool sizes based on pledge leverage provides a robust sybil enforcement, however lower saturation limits also lowers the cost of an oversaturation attack. The ultimate mitigation is not a formula modification, but instead 2-way at-will delegator acceptance staking which would allow a stake pool operator to exclude or 'veto' select stake keys. This solution has been previously discussed in the community and would benefit from its own CIP.\nThe new formula will not decrease the yields of any large stakeholders pledging to private pools. Large ADA stakeholders such as exchanges, liquidity pools, or smart contracts would not be required to pledge a vast majority of those holdings to earn yields currently only achievable with fully pledged pools. This property improves overall liquidity. The large stakeholders who voluntarily choose to divide their stake to dozens of community pools will also achieve more fault tolerance than self-operating a small number of centralized private pools. A number of wallets including Eternl are offering the capability to divide stake delegation between many pools.\nThis design decision aligns the interest of the largest stakeholders with the interests of the whole community. The only economic motivation remaining for groups with large stake including founder(s), founding organizations, exchanges, investment capital, trusts, and venture capital would be to enhance the value of the entire network by dividing delegation to secure diversification. Large stakeholders being able to divide stake without penalty to many smaller community pools will have the greatest impact on improving the effective decentralization and Nakamoto Coefficient of Cardano.\nTo validate any reward equation simulations must consider that an entity can choose to delegate to another entity, operate one stake pool, or operate many stake pools. Any new equation should be compared to the current equation with a0=0.3a0=0.3a0=0.3 and the current equation with minFee=0, a0=0.0a0=0.0a0=0.0. A large and increasing number of entities (1k - 1B) should be simulated for each trial of each equation. Additionally, during each epoch of each simulation for each equation block production should be sampled VRF-style from a discrete binomial or skellam distribution. Block production and rewards have statistical uncertainty.\nEach equation: Each epoch: sample block production (rewards) per pool Each entity may choose to: create/retire 1 or more pools adjust the fee/margin structure of their pool(s) delegate to the pool of a different entity\nEach equation: Each epoch: sample block production (rewards) per pool Each entity may choose to: create/retire 1 or more pools adjust the fee/margin structure of their pool(s) delegate to the pool of a different entity\nFor each equation in consideration the average (and variation) of the nakamoto coefficient, k-effective coefficient (or an entity/group based equivalent), and a sybil coefficient shall be computed for every epoch until conclusion. The sybil coefficient would quantify the fraction of stake controlled by all entities operating multiple pools excluding regulated businesses such as exchanges.\nParameter Ranges: k=[100 2000]k = [100 - 2000]k=[100 2000] L=[10 10000]L = [10 - 10000]L=[10 10000] a0=[0.0 10.0]a0 = [0.0 - 10.0]a0=[0.0 10.0] bias=[0.00 0.95]bias = [0.00 - 0.95]bias=[0.00 0.95]\nWhere equations and independent variables to test are:\nAnd the recommended testing permutations are:\nFor crossover in crossover_factor range [10,20,50]: For n in curved_root range [2,3,4]:\nFor crossover in crossover_factor range [10,20,50]: For n in curved_root range [2,3,4]:\n(incomplete)\nMahmoud Nimer's proposed reward equation presented in the Ada Link's Stakepool Pledge Influence in Stake Rewards Distribution Paper seeks to compare pool pledge to total network pool pledge, and reward pool pledge growth relative to stake pool size growth.\nWhere:\nImplementation will occur in two distinct phases with the first phase being only parameter changes requiring no hard fork. During this first phase any changes will be reversible. The second phase will require a hard fork. The implementation of this proposal must be smooth, justified, staged, deliberate, and well communicated through advertising and education.\nEach change in the implementation schedule should include clear communication to the community on expectations. Transparent education on how the parameters will work and the effect on rewards is important.\nAlthough we haven't entered the Voltaire era yet, we should still reach community concensus.\nReducing the mandatory minimum fee to 0 will allow smaller pools to become more competitive while allowing each individual pool to select an appropriate fixed fee.\nCreate an open source simulation suite to benchmark all of the possible equation forms and parameter variations.\nCompetitively evaluate, compare, contrast, and analyze the results of all possible equation forms and parameter variations.\nInclude the community in selecting the winning equation form and parameter set.\nHARDFORK implementation of the new equation and parameter set.\nMeasure decentralization, gather community feedback.\nSlightly adjust parameters by at most approximately 5 every 10 epochs until the end of Voltaire.\nAfter Voltaire adjust parameters annually/bi-annually by community vote.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\nCopyright 2022 - Michael Liesenfelt\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "These guidelines describe the audit process in general before setting out for DApp developers what information they will need to supply to auditors as part of the process. These are guidelines rather than requirements, and different auditors may engage differently, providing complementary services. The guidelines aim to establish a common baseline, including alternative ways of satisfying high-level requirements. Appendices provide (1) a glossary, (2) an audit FAQ, (3) a list of auditors for Cardano, and (4) a sample audit report.\nThis CIP aims to promote the process of audit for DApps on Cardano, to improve the overall standard of assurance of DApps built for Cardano, and thus to contribute the improvement of the wider Cardano ecosystem.\nDApp users seek assurance about DApps that they wish to use. This comes from running automated tools on DApps and their components, as well as by audit of complete DApps. Secure evidence of these tool (level 1) and audit (level 2) results is provided by a certification service, and made available to users through a service such as a DApp store or wallet. In the longer term, results of formal verification (level 3) will also form part of the certification process.\nDApp developers seek to drive adoption through their DApps being certified. Wallets and DApp stores are enhanced by providing certification services, and the wider Cardano ecosystem is strengthened through certification becoming widespread. Best practice standards can be developed by the audit and tooling communities, and systematised by the Cardano Foundation. This document is a first step in that direction.\nAssurance can only ever be partial: a DApp can be shown to have some good features and to avoid some bad ones, but this is not a guarantee that using a DApp will not have negative consequences for a user. This is not simply because tools and audits cannot give complete coverage, but also because attacks may come at lower (e.g. network, browser) or higher (e.g. crypto-economic) levels than addressed here.\nThese are guidelines rather than requirements, and different auditors may engage differently, providing complementary services. The guidelines aim to establish a common baseline, including alternative ways of satisfying high-level requirements. Appendices provide (1) a glossary, (2) an audit FAQ, (3) a list of auditors for Cardano, and (4) a sample audit report.\n(Smart) contract: a program that runs on blockchain. In the case of Cardano, this will be a Plutus program that will contain Plutus Core components that run on blockchain as well as other code that runs off chain. All auditors will scrutinise on-chain code, some will examine off-chain code too.Some auditors might also provide orthogonal services eg. auditing a zero-knowledge protocol or an economic model.\nDApp: a complete distributed application that runs on blockchain. This will include off-chain code written in other languages, e.g. running in a browser, and will integrate or link with other services such as wallets and oracles.\nAssurance: the process of establishing various properties of systems, both positive (it does this) and negative (it doesn t do this), with different degrees of certainty.\nAudit: the process of establishing assurance by means of manual examination of artefacts, systems, processes etc. Can involve some tooling, but it is a human-led process.\nTooling: using automated processes to establish degrees of assurance of systems. Tools may be run on target DApps by parties providing such a service.\nEvidence: artefacts coming out of tooling and audit that can support assertions of assurance of systems. Examples include formal proofs, test suites, prior counterexamples and so on, as well as audit reports.\nCertification: the process and technology of giving to DApp end-users and developers secure evidence of forms of assurance about DApps and their component smart contracts. In the case of Cardano our approach is to provide information on chain as transaction metadata.\nNote: certification has also been used informally to cover the combined process of testing, audit, verification and providing evidence of these, as in level 1 certification . If it is felt that it is too confusing to use the term in both senses, then another term should be found, e.g. evidencing or witnessing.\nComponent: a discrete part of the complete system supplied by a third party, such as a wallet, (part of) which will be run on the user s system.\nService: a part of the system, such as Blockfrost, that is provided by an online server accessed through a well-defined protocol.\nScope: the parts of the DApp that are subject to audit. A repository may contain much more than Plutus code. Some audits will look at the complete app, some will just concentrate on on-chain transactions, others on the web interface around it. The possible scopes are divided in three main categories:\nDeployment: once a DApp is developed it is deployed by submitting the relevant on-chain scripts onto the Cardano blockchain as transaction validator scripts. The scripts being deployed might be the scripts that have been audited, or be instances of them in the case that the audited scripts are parametric.\nAn audit is a comprehensive investigation of a DApp that provides an in-depth analysis on bugs, vulnerabilities, code quality and correctness of implementation. An audit does not necessarily analyse completed DApps and often will instead analyse a fragment of a DApp. For example many auditors will only analyse the on-chain code of a DApp.\nAudits are provided by companies that specialise in the area of the developed DApp. In this case it will be experts on the Cardano blockchain and Plutus smart contracts.\nThis first part of the process is tendering, where developers will need to provide preliminary information about their DApp to candidate auditors, as described below.\nOnce a contract is agreed, the next step in the process is to provide the auditors with the necessary information to perform the audit as set out in the guidelines below. Auditors may work with developers to ensure that the documentation and other materials for audit are prepared to the standard that is required for the audit to take place. Different auditors will have different requirements, but the guidelines below establish the minimum requirements.\nAuditors will typically produce a first version of a report, which the developer can use as a guide to improving their DApp, before submitting changes to produce the final version of the code on which the final, published report is based. Once a DApp is audited, it will be deployed on the Cardano blockchain.\nA developer should contact an auditor when they have a final working version of a DApp or fragment of a DApp that they want to have audited. Once the contract is agreed, the developer will need to provide the auditor with a final version of the DApp for audit.\nHowever, it is recommended to contact a potential auditor as early as possible because many auditors also provide consultation services for the design and development of the DApps. A developer is encouraged to contact the auditor as early as possible so as to mitigate any design issues which may be very hard if not impossible to fix. Early contact is also encouraged because securing a time slot with an auditor in advance shortens the DApp s overall time to market, finally, early contact allows for scheduling and potentially avoids long delays between starting and completing an audit.\nAll audits will examine the on-chain code that is used to validate transactions submitted to advance the smart contracts that constitute part of a DApp. Audit may also cover more of the code in a DApp, including on- and off-chain code written in Plutus, as well as other languages, e.g. JavaScript running in a browser.\nAn audit is not a guarantee of unbreakable security nor a way to offset trust or responsibility. An audit will provide an in-depth review of the source code of a DApp. The audit will provide a comprehensive code review detailing any found vulnerabilities, comments on the quality of code as well as an analysis of the implementation in regards to the supplied specification. An audit cannot guarantee that all possible vulnerabilities will be found or that the deployed DApp will perform as intended. This is especially true in the cases where an audit only looks at a fragment of a DApp or when a DApp has been updated.\nDApps are used by DApp users, and built by DApp developers. Audit is performed by audit companies, using tools developed by themselves and other tool developers. Tooling can be run by tool service providers, and evidence of those and other results produced by certification providers. Audit is also impacted by components (e.g. light wallets) and services (e.g. blockfrost) provided by ecosystem members. Standards can be developed by industry consortia or governance organisations (e.g. the Cardano Foundation). In the widest sense, all holders of Ada stand to benefit from Cardano building an expectation that DApps are certified.\nIn order to provide a quote for audit, developers will need to supply\nIn order to be audited, developers will need to supply the following documentation.\nSubmitters shall provide specification and design documents that describe in a precise and unambiguous way the architecture, interfaces and requirements characterising the DApp.\nThe documentation shall identify the expected behaviour of the code, given without direct reference to the code itself. The description should also include high-level examples demonstrating use cases of the DApp. All assumptions about how the DApp will be used will be described. The documentation shall identify and document all the interfaces with other components and services.\nSubmitters might also wish to explain mitigating actions that they have taken to protect against potential failures and attacks to the DApp.\nThe format of transactions accepted by the smart contracts should be specified using the template provided in the auxiliary document Tx-spec.md.\nTx-spec.md\nThe document should clearly specify the properties to be satisfied by the smart contract.\nA formal specification is recommended but not mandatory.\nFor off-chain analysis additional information should be provided for the components and services interfaced:\nIdeally, submitters should submit a description of how the DApp has been tested, the results of the tests, and details of how those test results can be replicated.In particular:\nIn the case that off-chain code is included in the scope of the audit, testing should be able to assess the performance and robustness of the DApp against significant throughput, under substantial workload, and in the scenario of a DoS attack.\nA final version of the source code should be provided that works with the use cases specified in the documentation. Information needs to be provided to allow the DApp to be built in an unambiguous and reproducible way, including any external components and services that the DApp uses. This could be in the form of\nVersioning information needs to be given in a way that allows end users of a DApp to determine whether or not the version of the DApp that they are using is covered by certification information held on blockchain.\nThis can be done in a number of different ways, depending on the type of audit. These include:\nIt is planned that DApps will be registered on the Cardano blockchain. This is currently under discussion. Once that discussion has been settled, it will also be possible to provide on-chain evidence of audit, linked to a registered entity. The mechanism for this is described in a separate document which it is intended to make into another CIP. A current draft of that document is here: Proof of Audit document.\nAuditors shall be able to carry out the following activities:\nAuditors shall provide credentials for the following competencies:\nDisclosure It is common but not universal practice for disclosure/publication of audit report, for example as a part of a responsible disclosure policy. A typical policy would be to publish a report after a certain period (e.g. 30-90 day) or at the point that a DApp goes live, whichever is earlier.\nThese guidelines are the result of a process of discussion between IOG staff and members of the audit and academic communities over a series of online meetings in February and March 2022. Audit organisations involved include Tweag, WellTyped, Certik, Runtime Verification, BT Block, MLabs, Quviq and Hachi/Meld, all of which supported the guidelines outlined here.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0054?",
    "completion": "This CIP specifies a standard for an API which should be provided to Javascript NFTs, it also defines some additions to the 721 metadata standard defined in CIP-0025 which allow an NFT to specify it would like to receive certain current information from the blockchain.\nCurrently if an NFT creator wishes to change or otherwise evolve their NFT after minting, they must burn the token and re-mint. It would be very nice if the user were able to modify their NFT simply by sending it to themselves with some extra data contained in the new transaction metadata. This would allow implementation of something like a ROM+RAM concept, where you have the original immutable part of the NFT (in Cardano s case represented by the original 721 key from the mint transaction), and you also have a mutable part represented by any subsequent transaction metadata.\nIt would also be nice to be able to retrieve data that has been previously committed to the blockchain, separately to the NFT which wishes to access it. This would be useful for retrieving oracle data such as current Ada price quotes as well as for allowing an NFT to import another NFT s data.\nFurther to this - for on-chain programatically generated NFTs, it makes sense to mint the code to render the NFT as one token, and then have the individual NFTs contain only the input variables for that code. This CIP specifies an additional metadata option which specifies that an NFT should be rendered by another token - this will massively reduce code duplication in on-chain NFTs.\nThis combination of functionality enables many exciting new possibilities with on-chain NFTs.\nMinting metadata for Smart NFTs based on the existing CIP-0025 standard:\n{ \"721\": { \"<policy_id>\": { \"<asset_name>\": { \"name\": <string>, \"image\": <uri | array>, \"mediaType\": \"image/<mime_sub_type>\", \"description\": <string | array>, \"files\": [{ \"id\": <string> \"name\": <string>, \"mediaType\": <mime_type>, \"src\": <uri | array>, <other_properties> }], \"uses\": { \"transactions\": <string | array>, \"tokens\": <string | array>, \"renderer\": <string> } } }, \"version\": \"1.0\" } }\n{ \"721\": { \"<policy_id>\": { \"<asset_name>\": { \"name\": <string>, \"image\": <uri | array>, \"mediaType\": \"image/<mime_sub_type>\", \"description\": <string | array>, \"files\": [{ \"id\": <string> \"name\": <string>, \"mediaType\": <mime_type>, \"src\": <uri | array>, <other_properties> }], \"uses\": { \"transactions\": <string | array>, \"tokens\": <string | array>, \"renderer\": <string> } } }, \"version\": \"1.0\" } }\nHere we have added the uses key any future additions to the Smart NFT API can be implemented by adding additional keys here. We've also added an additional field to the files array - this is to specify a unique identifier to enable the files to be referenced by the Javascript API below.\nTo enable evolving NFTs where the NFT monitors a transaction history and changes in response to new transaction metadata, we define a sub-key called transactions , which can contain either a string or an array, specifying the tokens or addresses the NFT wishes to receive the transaction history for. These transaction histories will be provided to the NFT via the Javascript API detailed below.\nWe also define a special keyword own which can be used to monitor the NFT s own transaction history. So if we wish to create an evolvable NFT that can respond to additions to its own transaction history, the uses key within the metadata would look like:\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": \"own\" }\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": \"own\" }\nIf you wanted to create an evolving NFT which monitors its own transaction history, as well as that of an external smart contract address, the metadata would look like this:\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": [ \"own\", \"addr1wywukn5q6lxsa5uymffh2esuk8s8fel7a0tna63rdntgrysv0f3ms\" ] }\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": [ \"own\", \"addr1wywukn5q6lxsa5uymffh2esuk8s8fel7a0tna63rdntgrysv0f3ms\" ] }\nFinally, we also provide the option to receive the transaction history for a specific token other than the NFT itself (generally this is intended to enable import of Oracle data or control data from an external source although monitoring an address transaction history could also be used for that).\nWhen specifying an external token to monitor, you should do so via the token s fingerprint as in this example:\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": [ \"own\", \"asset1frc5wn889lcmj5y943mcn7tl8psk98mc480v3j\" ] }\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": [ \"own\", \"asset1frc5wn889lcmj5y943mcn7tl8psk98mc480v3j\" ] }\nTo enable modifier tokens - (that is, a token which you can hold alongside a Smart NFT which changes the Smart NFT's appearance or behaviour in some way); we provide a way for the Smart NFT to monitor the tokens held by a specific address. Similarly to the transactions key, the tokens key will also accept either a string or array.\nIn this case we define the own keyword to mean the tokens held by the same stake key that currently holds the Smart NFT itself.\nFor example, to create an evolvable NFT which also supports modifier tokens, the uses block would look like this:\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": \"own\", \"tokens\": \"own\" }\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": \"own\", \"tokens\": \"own\" }\nWe could also monitor a particular smart contract address, for example if we wanted to see how many tokens were listed for sale on a marketplace. The following example creates an NFT that supports modifier tokens and also monitors the tokens held by a script address:\n\"uses\": { \"tokens\": [ \"own\", \"addr1wywukn5q6lxsa5uymffh2esuk8s8fel7a0tna63rdntgrysv0f3ms\" ] }\n\"uses\": { \"tokens\": [ \"own\", \"addr1wywukn5q6lxsa5uymffh2esuk8s8fel7a0tna63rdntgrysv0f3ms\" ] }\nThe idea behind the renderer key is to reduce code duplication in on-chain Javascript by moving the generative code part of the project into a single asset which is minted once in the policy. Each individual NFT within a project is then just a set of input parameters to the generative script - this totally removes the need to fill the metadata of every mint transaction with encoded HTML and Javascript, as is the case with many on-chain Javascript NFTs now.\nWhen a Smart NFT is encountered which specifies another asset as the renderer, the site rendering the NFT should look-up the referenced asset and render that - the rendering token will then be responsible for reading the appropriate information via the Javascript API below and changing its appearance and/or behaviour based on that. In its simplest form, the rendering token could simply read the current token fingerprint and use that to seed a random number generator - this would enable a generative project to mint NFTs without even changing anything in the metadata and still have the renderer change its appearance for each one. In practice though, it's probably cooler to put actual traits like \"colour scheme\" or \"movement speed\" into the metadata and then have the renderer change its behaviour based on that.\nVia the Javascript API, the rendering token will always receive the properties of the child token which specified it as its renderer. This means if you wish to use a renderer with a token which also evolves based on its own transaction history, you will need to specify both \"renderer\" and \"transactions\" keys within the child token, and within the renderer token you do not need to specify these keys.\nFor example, to create a Smart NFT which is rendered by another token, and is also evolvable based on its own transaction history, the \"uses\" key would look like this:\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": \"own\", \"renderer\": \"asset1frc5wn889lcmj5y943mcn7tl8psk98mc480v3j\" }\n\"uses\": { \"transactions\": \"own\", \"renderer\": \"asset1frc5wn889lcmj5y943mcn7tl8psk98mc480v3j\" }\nWhen an on-chain Javascript NFT is rendered which specifies any of the metadata options above, the website / dApp / wallet which creates the iframe sandbox, should inject the API defined here into that iframe sandbox. It is worth saying that the wallet dApp integration API from CIP-0030 should probably not be exposed inside the sandbox, to prevent cross-site-scripting attacks.\n<iframe>\n<iframe>\nThe Paginate data type along with APIError and PaginateError are copied directly from CIP-0030 and these functions should operate in a similar manner to that API.\nIt is recommended that the Smart NFT API not be injected for every NFT only the ones which specify the relevant metadata - this is an important step so that it s clear which NFTs require this additional API, and also to enable pre-loading and caching of the required data. We are aiming to expose only the specific data requested by the NFT in its metadata in this CIP we are not providing a more general API for querying arbitrary data from the blockchain.\nThere is potentially a desire to provide a more open-ended interface to query arbitrary data from the blockchain perhaps in the form of direct access to GraphQL but that may follow in a later CIP additional fields which could be added to the uses: {} metadata to enable the NFT to perform more complex queries on the blockchain.\nuses: {}\nAlthough an asynchronous API is specified so the data could be retrieved at the time when the NFT actually requests it it is expected that in most instances the site which renders the NFT would gather the relevant transaction logs in advance, and inject them into the iframe sandbox at the point where the sandbox is created, so that the data is immediately available to the NFT without having to perform an HTTP request.\n<iframe>\ncardano.nft.fingerprint: String\nThe fingerprint of the current token - in the case where we're rendering a child token, this will be the fingerprint of the child token.\ncardano.nft.metadata : Array\nThe content of the 721 key from the metadata json from the mint transaction of the current NFT - if we are rendering on behalf of a child NFT, this will be the metadata from the child NFT.\ncardano.nft.getTransactions( string which, paginate: Paginate = undefined ) : Promise<Object>\nErrors: APIError, PaginateError\nAPIError\nPaginateError\nThe argument to this function should be either an address, token fingerprint or the keyword own . It must match one of the ones specified via the transactions key in the new metadata mechanism detailed above.\ntransactions\nThis function will return a list of transaction hashes and metadata relating to the specified address or token. The list will be ordered by date with the newest transaction first, and will match the following format:\n{ \"transactions\": [ { \"txHash\": \"1507d1b15e5bd3c7827f1f0575eb0fdc3b26d69af0296a260c12d5c0c78239e0\", \"metadata\": <raw metadata from blockchain>, \"datum\": <the datum from the UTXO holding the token, if set> }, <more transactions here> ], \"fetched\": \"2022-05-01T22:39:03.369Z\" }\n{ \"transactions\": [ { \"txHash\": \"1507d1b15e5bd3c7827f1f0575eb0fdc3b26d69af0296a260c12d5c0c78239e0\", \"metadata\": <raw metadata from blockchain>, \"datum\": <the datum from the UTXO holding the token, if set> }, <more transactions here> ], \"fetched\": \"2022-05-01T22:39:03.369Z\" }\nFor simplicity, we do not include anything other than the txHash and the metadata since any other relevant details about the transaction can always be encoded into the metadata, there is no need to over-complicate by including other transaction data like inputs, outputs or the date of the transaction etc. That is left for a potential future extension of the API to include more full GraphQL support.\ncardano.nft.getTokens( string address, paginate: Paginate = undefined ) : Promise<Object>\nErrors: APIError, PaginateError\nAPIError\nPaginateError\nThis function accepts either an address or the keyword own as its argument - it must match one of the ones specified via the the tokens key in the new metadata mechanism detailed above.\ntokens\nThis function will return a list of the tokens held by the address specified in the argument, or held by the same stake key as the current token in the case of the own keyword.\n{ \"tokens\": [ { \"policyID\": \"781ab7667c5a53956faa09ca2614c4220350f361841a0424448f2f30\", \"assetName\": \"Life150\", \"fingerprint\": \"asset1frc5wn889lcmj5y943mcn7tl8psk98mc480v3j\", \"quantity\": 1, \"datum\": <the datum from the UTXO holding the token, if set> }, <more tokens here> ], \"fetched\": \"2022-05-01T22:39:03.369Z\" }\n{ \"tokens\": [ { \"policyID\": \"781ab7667c5a53956faa09ca2614c4220350f361841a0424448f2f30\", \"assetName\": \"Life150\", \"fingerprint\": \"asset1frc5wn889lcmj5y943mcn7tl8psk98mc480v3j\", \"quantity\": 1, \"datum\": <the datum from the UTXO holding the token, if set> }, <more tokens here> ], \"fetched\": \"2022-05-01T22:39:03.369Z\" }\ncardano.nft.getFileURL( string id = null, string fingerprint = null ) : Promise<String>\nErrors: APIError\nAPIError\nThis function provides access to the contents of files listed in the files[] array for this NFT - if the NFT is rendering on behalf of another NFT, the files arrays from both should be merged, with the child NFT items overwriting the rendering NFT, in the case of ID conflicts.\nfiles[]\nThe first argument specifies which entry from the files array should be retreived - if this argument is null, then the NFT's default image should be returned, which will typically come from the NFT's image metadata field rather than the files array. The second argument allows you to specify which token's files to search - it should either be the token itself (either the child token or the rendering token, in the case of tokens with a separate renderer). In the case where an NFT also uses the tokens part of this API, then the getFileURL() function will also allow you to specify any one of the fingerprints returned by the getTokens() query.\nimage\ntokens\nThe URL returned by this function should be in a format that is accessible from within the iframe sandbox - perhaps using window.URL.createObjectURL() to generate a static URL from raw data if necessary.\n<iframe>\nwindow.URL.createObjectURL()\nCurrently the NFT sites which support on-chain Javascript NFTs do so by creating a sandboxed iframe into which they inject the HTML from the NFT s metadata. From within this sandbox it is not possible to bring-in arbitrary data from external sources everything must be contained within the NFT, or explicitly bought into the sandbox via an API.\n<iframe>\nThis proposal suggests an addition to the 721 metadata key from CIP-0025, to enable an NFT to specify that it would like to receive a particular transaction history accessible to it from within the sandbox thus defining it as a Smart NFT .\nIn tandem with the additional metadata, we also define a standard for the Javascript API which is provided to the NFT within the sandbox.\nThis CIP now has a reference implementation which consists of a front-end React control which takes care of rendering an NFT - it creates the sandbox and exposes the CIP54 Javascript API to it. This works in tandem with a backend library which takes care of reading the necessary data from a dbsync instance and making it available for the front end control to render.\nThere is also an integrated development environment made available to enable realtime experimentation and debugging of Smart NFTs without having to repeatedly mint new tokens.\nFurthermore, a complete visual blockchain explorer has been made available which utilises libcip54 and SmartNFTPortal and fully supports the reference implementation of this standard.\nThe first CIP54 collection has been minted on mainnet under the policy ID 1eaf3b3ffb75ff27c43c512c23c6450b307f138281efb1d690b84652 and is available to see here.

    "completion": "This CIP extends CIP-0028 to introduce a change to one of the Alonzo protocol parameters in the Babbage era, namely lovelacePerUTxOWord. We propose to have this updateable parameter be based on bytes instead of words (eight bytes). Additionally, two Alonzo era protocol parameters were removed, namely the decentralization parameter and the extra entropy parameter.\nlovelacePerUTxOWord\nSince the Shelley era, there has been an minimum number of lovelace requirement for every unspent transaction output. This requirement acts like a deposit, guarding the network from dust (the proliferation of small-valued unspent transaction outputs). Initially it was a constant value, since the Shelley era UTxO were simple and quite uniform. Starting in the Mary era, however, the constant value was replace with a formula to account for the variability in outputs that contained multi-assets. The formula was changed again in the Alonzo era. Both the Mary and the Alonzo era formulas provide an upper bound on the size in memory of an unspent transaction output in the Haskell implementation. We would like to simplify the formula to instead count the number of bytes in the CBOR serialization.\nTwo Alonzo era protocol parameters need to be removed for the Babbage era, since they relate to TPraos. Transitional Praos (named TPraos in the code base) is the addition of two features to Praos, which were added to provide a smooth transition from Ouroboros-BFT. In particular, Transitional Praos included an overlay schedule which could be tuned by the d parameter (d == 1 means that all the blocks are produced by the BFT nodes, d == 0 means that none of them are). It also included a way of injecting extra entropy into the epoch nonce. The extra entropy feature was used precisely once, and was explained wonderfully by one of the original authors of the Praos paper.\nTPraos\nTPraos\nd\nd == 1\nd == 0\nThe Babbage era removes both of the \"transitional\" features of TPraos, rendering the decentralization parameter and the extra entropy parameter useless.\nThe removal of the decentralization parameter and the extra entropy parameter is self explanatory. We now describe the specification of the coinsPerUTxOByte parameter.\ncoinsPerUTxOByte\nThe name of the protocol parameter is actually coinsPerUTxOWord in the Haskell implementation. It should be renamed to coinsPerUTxOByte.\ncoinsPerUTxOWord\ncoinsPerUTxOByte\nAt the moment that the hard fork combinator translates the Alonzo era ledger state to the Babbage era, the current value of coinsPerUTxOWord will be converted to\ncoinsPerUTxOWord\n⌊ coinsPerUTxOWord / 8 ⌋\n⌊ coinsPerUTxOWord / 8 ⌋\nIn the Babbage era, unspent transaction outputs will be required to contain at least\n(160 + |serialized_output|) * coinsPerUTxOByte\n(160 + |serialized_output|) * coinsPerUTxOByte\nmany lovelace. The constant overhead of 160 bytes accounts for the transaction input and the entry in the UTxO map data structure (20 words * 8 bytes).\nWe would like the formula for the minimum lovelace in a unspent transaction output be simpler and easier to reason about by all users of the Cardano network, while at the same time accounting for the size of the output.\nThe translation section explains how we will transition from the coinsPerUTxOWord parameter to the coinsPerUTxOByte parameter. Starting in the Babbage era, update proposals that want to modify coinsPerUTxOByte must bear in mind that the measurement is in bytes, not words.\ncoinsPerUTxOWord\ncoinsPerUTxOByte\ncoinsPerUTxOByte\nThe two protocol parameters that have been removed, d and extraEntropy, can no longer be used in protocol parameter updates.\nd\nextraEntropy\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This document specifies a language for documenting Plutus contracts in a machine-readable manner. This is akin to what OpenAPI or AsyncAPI are for, documenting HTTP services and asynchronous services respectively. In a similar fashion, A Plutus contract has a binary interface which is mostly defined by its datum and redeemer.\nThis document is therefore a meta-specification defining the vocabulary and validation rules with which one can specify a Plutus contract interface, a.k.a Plutus contract blueprint.\nWhile publicly accessible, on-chain contracts are currently inscrutable. Ideally, one would want to get an understanding of transactions revolving around script executions. This is both useful to visualize and to control the evolution of a contract life-cycle; but also, as a user interacting with a contract, to ensure that one is authorizing a transaction to do what it's intended to. Having a machine-readable specification in the form of a JSON-schema makes it easier (or even, possible) to enable a wide variety of use cases from a single concise document, such as:\nMoreover, by making the effort to write a clear specification of their contracts, DApps developers make their contracts easier to audit (as they're able to specify the expected behavior).\nThis specification introduces the notion of a Plutus contract blueprint, as a JSON document which it itself a JSON-schema as per the definition of given in JSON Schema: A Media Type for Describing JSON Documents: Draft 2020-12.\nSaid differently, Plutus blueprints are first and foremost, valid JSON schemas (according to the specification linked above). This specification defines a core vocabulary and additional keywords which are tailored to the specification of Plutus contracts. Tools supporting this specification must implement the semantic and validation rules specified in this document.\nMeta-schemas for Plutus blueprints (i.e. schemas used for validating Plutus blueprints themselves) are given in annexe.\nA Plutus contract blueprint is made of a single document describing one or more on-chain validators. By convention, the document is named plutus.json and should be located at the root of a project's repository to facilitate its discoverability.\nplutus.json\nThe document itself is a JSON object with the following fields:\nNote that examples of specifications are given later in the document to keep the specification succinct enough and not bloated with examples.\nThe preamble fields stores meta-information about the contract such as version numbers or a short description. This field is mainly meant for humans as a mean to contextualize a specification.\npreamble\nThe compiler field is optional, but allows specifying metadata about the toolkit that produced the validator and blueprint.\ncompiler\nValidators are the essence of the blueprint. This section describes each validator involved in the contract (simple applications will likely have only a single validator). A validator is mainly defined by three things: a title, arguments (i.e parameters, redeemer and/or datum) and some compiled code. Parameters refer to compile-time arguments that can be applied to a validator template. They must be instantiated to produce a final compiled code as they are embedded in the code of the validator itself. This is often the case for validators that must hold on unique external nonce to produce unique hashes.\ncompiledCode\nredeemer, datum and parameters items all share the same schema structure. They must define a schema that describes how to construct valid on-chain values for each of these fields, and they also specify a purpose (spend, mint, withdraw or publish) that indicates in which context it can figure. The purpose is either a string, or an applicator oneOf that specifies multiple (distinct) purposes. Similarly, an argument is either an object as described below, or an applicator oneOf of such objects. In case where it is defined as an applicator, purpose values between objects must be strictly non-overlapping as they are used as discriminant in chosing a schema. This allows, for example, to define different redeemer schemas for different purposes.\nredeemer\ndatum\nparameters\nschema\nspend\nmint\nwithdraw\npublish\noneOf\noneOf\npurpose\n\"spend\"\n\"mint\"\n\"withdraw\"\n\"publish\"\noneOf\noneOf\nA set of extra schemas to be re-used as references across the specification.\nPlutus blueprints ultimately describes on-chain data value that can be found at the validator's interface boundaries. This means that while we would generally operate at the level of Plutus Data, the vocabulary covers in practice any of the possible Untyped Plutus Core (abbrev. UPLC) primitives that can appear at a validator's boundary (e.g. compile-time parameters). Any UPLC primitive is therefore represented as a schema with a dataType keyword. The possible values for dataType are detailed just below. In addition, and depending on the value of dataType, we may find additional keywords in the vocabulary.\ndataType\ndataType\ndataType\ninteger\niData\nbytes\nbData\nlist\nlistData\nmap\nmapData\nconstructor\nconstrData\n#unit\n#boolean\n#integer\n#bytes\n#string\n#pair\nData\n#list\nData\nWarning\nWhile they exist for completeness, frameworks are strongly discouraged to use any of the constructs starting with a # as they refer to Plutus Core builtins types used by the Plutus virtual machines but aren't meant to figure in outward-facing interfaces. Validators should, as much as possible, stick to integer, bytes, list, map and constructor (and any composition of those) for their binary interface.\n#\ninteger\nbytes\nlist\nmap\nconstructor\nUsing these primitives, it becomes possible to represent the entire domain (i.e. possible values) which can be manipulated by Plutus contracts.\nSimilarly to JSON schemas, we provide extra validation keywords and keywords for applying subschemas with logic to further refine the definition of core primitives. Keywords allow to combine core data-types into bigger types and we'll later give some pre-defined definitions which we assume to be part of the core vocabulary and therefore, recognized by any tool supporting this standard.\nWhen presented with a validation keyword with a malformed value (e.g. \"maxLength\": \"foo\"), programs are expected to return an appropriate error.\n\"maxLength\": \"foo\"\nBeside, we define a Plutus Data Schema as a JSON object with a set of fields depending on its corresponding data-type. When we refer to a Plutus Data Schema, we refer to the entire schema definition, with its validations and with the semantic of each keywords applied.\nUnless otherwise specified, keywords are all considered optional.\nHere below are detailed all the accepted keywords for each data-type.\nNote Keywords in this section applies to any instance data-type described above.\ndataType\nThe value of this keyword must be a string, with one of the following value listed in the first column of the table above. This keyword is optional. When missing, the instance is implicitly typed as an opaque Plutus Data. When set, it defines the realm of other applicable keywords for that instance.\ntitle\nThis keyword's value must be a string. This keyword can be used to decorate a user interface and qualify an instance with some short title.\ndescription\nThis keyword's value must be a string. This keyword can be used to decorate a user interface and provide explanation about the purpose of the instance described by this schema.\n$comment\nThis keyword's value must be a string. It is meant mainly for programmers and humans reading the specification. This keyword should be ignored by programs.\nallOf\nThis keyword's value must be a non-empty array. Each item of the array MUST be a valid Plutus Data Schema. An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it validates successfully against all schemas defined by this keyword's value.\nanyOf\nThis keyword's value must be a non-empty array. Each item of the array must be a valid Plutus Data Schema. An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it validates successfully against at least one schema defined by this keyword's value.\noneOf\nThis keyword's value must be a non-empty array. Each item of the array must be a valid Plutus Data Schema. An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it validates successfully against exactly one schema defined by this keyword's value.\nnot\nThis keyword's value must be a valid Plutus Data Schema. An instance is valid against this keyword if it fails to validate successfully against the schema defined by this keyword.\n{ \"dataType\": \"bytes\" }\nNote Keywords in this section only applies to bytes. Using them in conjunction with an invalid data-type should result in an error.\nbytes\nenum\nThe value of this keyword must be an array of hex-encoded string literals. An instance validates successfully against this keyword if once hex-encoded, its value matches one of the elements of the keyword's values.\nmaxLength\nThe value of this keyword must be a non-negative integer. A bytes instance is valid against this keyword if its length is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.\nminLength\nThe value of this keyword must be a non-negative integer. A bytes instance is valid against this keyword if its length is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.\n{ \"dataType\": \"integer\" }\nNote Keywords in this section only applies to integer. Using them in conjunction with an invalid type should result in an error.\ninteger\nmultipleOf\nThe value of \"multipleOf\" must be a integer, strictly greater than 0. The instance is valid if division by this keyword's value results in an integer.\nmaximum\nThe value of \"maximum\" must be a integer, representing an inclusive upper limit. This keyword validates only if the instance is less than or exactly equal to \"maximum\".\nexclusiveMaximum\nThe value of \"exclusiveMaximum\" must be an integer, representing an exclusive upper limit. The instance is valid only if it has a value strictly less than (not equal to) \"exclusiveMaximum\".\nminimum\nThe value of \"minimum\" must be an integer, representing an inclusive lower limit. This keyword validates only if the instance is greater than or exactly equal to \"minimum\".\nexclusiveMinimum\nThe value of \"exclusiveMinimum\" must be a integer, representing an exclusive lower limit. The instance is valid only if it has a value strictly greater than (not equal to) \"exclusiveMinimum\".\n{ \"dataType\": \"list\" }\nNote Keywords in this section only applies to list. Using them in conjunction with an invalid data-type should result in an error.\nlist\nitems\nThe value of this keyword must be either another Plutus Data Schema or a list of Plutus Data Schema. When this keyword is a single schema, it applies its subschema to all child instances of the list. When it is a list, then the list is expected to have exactly the same number of elements as specified by the keyword and each element must match against the schema corresponding to its position. The list variation is useful to represent product types such as tuples.\nmaxItems\nThe value of this keyword must be a non-negative integer. An array instance is valid against \"maxItems\" if its size is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.\nminItems\nThe value of this keyword must be a non-negative integer. A list instance is valid against \"minItems\" if its size is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.\nuniqueItems\nThe value of this keyword must be a boolean. If this keyword has boolean value false, the instance validates successfully. If it has boolean value true, the instance validates successfully if all of its elements are unique.\n{ \"dataType\": \"map\" }\nNote Keywords in this section only applies to map. Using them in conjunction with an invalid data-type should result in an error.\nmap\nkeys\nThe value of this keyword must be another Plutus Data Schema. This keyword applies its subschema to all keys of the map.\nvalues\nThe value of this keyword must be another Plutus Data Schema. This keyword applies its subschema to all values of the map.\nmaxItems\nThe value of this keyword must be a non-negative integer. An object instance is valid against \"maxItems\" if its number of key-value pair elements is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.\nminItems\nThe value of this keyword must be a non-negative integer. An object instance is valid against \"minItems\" if its number of key-value pair elements is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.\n{ \"dataType\": \"constructor\" }\nNote Keywords in this section only applies to constructor. Using them in conjunction with an invalid data-type should result in an error.\nconstructor\nindex\nThis keyword's value must be a non-negative integer. An instance is valid against this keyword if it represents a Plutus constructor whose index is the same as this keyword's value. This keyword is mandatory.\nfields\nThis keyword's value must be an array of valid Plutus Data Schema; possibly empty. An instance is valid against this keyword if it represents a Plutus constructor for which each field is valid under each subschema given by this keyword's value. Fields are compared positionally. This keyword is mandatory.\n{ \"$schema\": \"https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip57/schemas/plutus-blueprint.json\", \"$id\": \"https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken/blob/main/examples/hello_world/plutus.json\", \"$vocabulary\": { \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/vocab/core\": true, \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/vocab/applicator\": true, \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/vocab/validation\": true, \"https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip57\": true }, \"preamble\": { \"title\": \"aiken-lang/hello_world\", \"description\": \"Aiken contracts for project 'aiken-lang/hello_world'\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"plutusVersion\": \"v2\" }, \"validators\": [ { \"title\": \"hello_world\", \"datum\": { \"title\": \"Datum\", \"purpose\": \"spend\", \"schema\": { \"anyOf\": [ { \"title\": \"Datum\", \"dataType\": \"constructor\", \"index\": 0, \"fields\": [ { \"title\": \"owner\", \"dataType\": \"bytes\" } ] } ] } }, \"redeemer\": { \"title\": \"Redeemer\", \"schema\": { \"anyOf\": [ { \"title\": \"Redeemer\", \"dataType\": \"constructor\", \"index\": 0, \"fields\": [ { \"title\": \"msg\", \"dataType\": \"bytes\" } ] } ] } }, \"compiledCode\": \"58ad0100003232322225333004323253330063372e646e64004dd7198009801002240009210d48656c6c6f2c20576f726c64210013233300100137586600460066600460060089000240206eb8cc008c00c019200022253335573e004294054ccc024cdc79bae300a00200114a226660060066016004002294088c8ccc0040052000003222333300a3370e008004016466600800866e0000d2002300d001001235573c6ea8004526165734ae855d11\", \"hash\": \"5e1e8fa84f2b557ddc362329413caa3fd89a1be26bfd24be05ce0a02\" } ] }\n{ \"$schema\": \"https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip57/schemas/plutus-blueprint.json\", \"$id\": \"https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken/blob/main/examples/hello_world/plutus.json\", \"$vocabulary\": { \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/vocab/core\": true, \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/vocab/applicator\": true, \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/vocab/validation\": true, \"https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip57\": true }, \"preamble\": { \"title\": \"aiken-lang/hello_world\", \"description\": \"Aiken contracts for project 'aiken-lang/hello_world'\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"plutusVersion\": \"v2\" }, \"validators\": [ { \"title\": \"hello_world\", \"datum\": { \"title\": \"Datum\", \"purpose\": \"spend\", \"schema\": { \"anyOf\": [ { \"title\": \"Datum\", \"dataType\": \"constructor\", \"index\": 0, \"fields\": [ { \"title\": \"owner\", \"dataType\": \"bytes\" } ] } ] } }, \"redeemer\": { \"title\": \"Redeemer\", \"schema\": { \"anyOf\": [ { \"title\": \"Redeemer\", \"dataType\": \"constructor\", \"index\": 0, \"fields\": [ { \"title\": \"msg\", \"dataType\": \"bytes\" } ] } ] } }, \"compiledCode\": \"58ad0100003232322225333004323253330063372e646e64004dd7198009801002240009210d48656c6c6f2c20576f726c64210013233300100137586600460066600460060089000240206eb8cc008c00c019200022253335573e004294054ccc024cdc79bae300a00200114a226660060066016004002294088c8ccc0040052000003222333300a3370e008004016466600800866e0000d2002300d001001235573c6ea8004526165734ae855d11\", \"hash\": \"5e1e8fa84f2b557ddc362329413caa3fd89a1be26bfd24be05ce0a02\" } ] }\nTHe primary goal of this CIP is to offer a mean of interoperability between tools of the ecosystem. In a world where every step of a contract development happens within a single framework -- like it's been the case with PlutusTx, this may not be seen as particularly useful. However, as soon as we start having an ecosystem of tools that operate a different levels (e.g. a language compiler, a transaction building library, an chain explorer, ...) we need some level of interoperability between them. Because the on-chain binary interface is the ultimate source of truth, it only makes sense to find an adequate way to capture it.\nJSON schemas are pervasively used in the industry for describing all sort of data models. Over the years, they have matured enough to be well understood by and familiar to a large portion of developers. Plus, tooling now exists in pretty much any major language to parse and process JSON schemas. Thus, using it as a foundation for the blueprint only makes sense.\nThis specification defines a new set of primitives types such as integer, bytes, list, map and constructor instead of the classic integer, number, string, bool, array, object, null. This is not only to reflect better the underlying structure of Plutus data which differs from JSON by many aspects, but also to allow defining or re-defining logic and validation keywords for each of those primitives.\ninteger\nbytes\nlist\nmap\nconstructor\ninteger\nnumber\nstring\nbool\narray\nobject\nnull\nNote however that apart from the keyword type, the terminology (and semantic) used for JSON schemas has been preserved to not \"reinvent the wheel\" and makes it easier to build tools on top by leveraging what already exists. Plutus schemas do not use type but use dataType instead to avoid possible confusion with JSON-schemas. A Plutus data schema is almost a JSON-schemas, but only supports a subset of the available keywords and has subtle differences for some of them (e.g. keywords for the bytes data-type operate mostly on hex-encoded strings).\ntype\ntype\ndataType\nbytes\nIn the original design specification of CIP-0057, we did not include UPLC builtins. But, there are a few legitimate cases where they might be found in the binary interface of validators. In particular, the ProtoPair builtin for constructing 2-tuples. This poses a problem of exhaustiveness (why only include ProtoPair and not the others where similar arguments could probably be made anyway). This is solved by being exhaustive in the capabilities of the blueprint specification, while discouraging their usage.\nProtoPair\nAnother point of designs here is to make Data rather transparent and promote Data's constructor variants as first-class data-types even though it's not faithfully representing what is really happening on-chain. An alternative, more faithful, representation to what's proposed would have been to have data as one of the data-type, and then keywords that identifies which of the data variant we are dealing with. So for example, instead of writing:\nData\ndata\n{ \"dataType\": \"integer\" }\n{ \"dataType\": \"integer\" }\nOne would have written:\n{ \"dataType\": \"data\", \"variant\": \"iData\" }\n{ \"dataType\": \"data\", \"variant\": \"iData\" }\nYet, because we do want Data to be the primary binary interface medium, we keep the former notation as it's more succinct and is a unambiguous shorthand. This also allows to segregate all builtins behind a common notation -- that is, prefixed with a #.\nData\n#\nOriginally, blueprints did not include any notion of purpose. However, as one of the end goal is to utilize blueprint as an input source for user interfaces, it becomes useful to:\nYet, whereas there's a notion of purpose on-chain that is tightly coupled to the script context, different on-chain framework may handle the purpose differently. Some may chose, for example, to abstract that concern away from their users. Which is why we only make the purpose an optional field (except for datum) to leave a bit of flexibility for blueprint producers. For consumers, we recommend to treat purposes as discriminants to refine interfaces, but assume that a validator without purpose simply apply to any purpose.\ndatum\nBlueprints are produced by one or (ideally) more smart-contract frameworks on Cardano.\nThere exist one or (ideally) more tools leveraging the blueprints\nCC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0058?",
    "completion": "Add primitives for bitwise operations, based on BuiltinByteString, without requiring new data types.\nBuiltinByteString\nBitwise operations are one of the most fundamental building blocks of algorithms and data structures. They can be used for a wide variety of applications, ranging from representing and manipulating sets of integers efficiently, to implementations of cryptographic primitives, to fast searches. Their wide availability, law-abiding behaviour and efficiency are the key reasons why they are widely used, and widely depended on.\nAt present, Plutus lacks meaningful support for bitwise operations, which significantly limits what can be usefully done on-chain. While it is possible to mimic some of these capabilities with what currently exists, and it is always possible to introduce new primitives for any task, this is extremely unsustainable, and often leads to significant inefficiencies and duplication of effort.\nWe describe a list of bitwise operations, as well as their intended semantics, designed to address this problem.\nWe provide a range of applications that could be useful or beneficial on-chain, but are difficult or impossible to implement without some, or all, of the primitives we propose.\nFinite field arithmetic is an area with many applications, ranging from linear block codes to zero-knowledge proofs to scheduling and experimental design. Having such capabilities on-chain is useful in for a wide range of applications.\nA good example is multiplication over the Goldilocks field (with characteristic 264 232+12 64 - 2 32 + 1264 232+1). To perform this operation requires 'slicing' the representation being worked with into 32-bit chunks. As finite field representations are some kind of unsigned integer in every implementation, in Plutus, this would correspond to Integers, but currently, there is no way to perform this kind of 'slicing' on an Integer on-chain.\nInteger\nInteger\nFurthermore, finite field arithmetic can gain significant performance optimizations with the use of bitwise primitive operations. Two good examples are power-of-two division and computing inverses. The first of these (useful even in Integer arithmetic) replaces a division by a power of 2 with a shift; the second uses a count trailing zeroes operation to compute a multiplicative finite field inverse. While some of these operations could theoretically be done by other means, their performance is far from guaranteed. For example, GHC does not convert a power-of-two division or multiplication to a shift, even if the divisor or multiplier is statically-known. Given the restrictions on computation resources on-chain, any gains are significant.\nInteger\nHaving bitwise primitives, as well as the ability to convert Integers into a form amenable to this kind of work, would allow efficient finite field arithmetic on-chain. This could enable a range of new uses without being inefficient or difficult to port.\nInteger\nDue to the on-chain size limit, many data structures become impractical or impossible, as they require too much space either for their elements, or their overheads, to allow them to fit alongside the operations we want to perform on them. Succinct data structures could serve as a solution to this, as they represent data in an amount of space much closer to the entropy limit and ensure only constant overheads. There are several examples of these, and all rely on bitwise operations for their implementations.\nFor example, consider wanting to store a set of BuiltinIntegers on-chain. Given current on-chain primitives, the most viable option involves some variant on a BuiltinList of BuiltinIntegers; however, this is unviable in practice unless the set is small. To see why, suppose that we have an upper limit of kkk on the BuiltinIntegers we want to store; this is realistic in practically all cases. To store nnn BuiltinIntegers under the above scheme requires\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinList\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nbits, where ccc denotes the constant overhead for each cons cell of the BuiltinList holding the data. If the set being represented is dense (meaning that the number of entries is a sizeable fraction of kkk), this cost becomes intolerable quickly, especially when taking into account the need to also store the operations manipulating such a structure on-chain with the script where the set is being used.\nBuiltinList\nIf we instead represented the same set as a bitmap based on BuiltinByteString, the amount of space required would instead be\nBuiltinByteString\nbits. This is significantly better unless nnn is small. Furthermore, this representation would likely be more efficient in terms of time in practice, as instead of having to crawl through a cons-like structure, we can implement set operations on a memory-contiguous byte string:\nA potential implementation could use a range of techniques to make these operations extremely efficient, by relying on SWAR techniques if portability is desired, and SIMD instructions for maximum speed. This would allow both potentially large integer sets to be represented on-chain without breaking the size limit, and nodes to efficiently compute with such, reducing the usage of resources by the chain. Lastly, in practice, if compression techniques are used (which also rely on bitwise operations!), the number of required bits can be reduced considerably in most cases without compromising performance: the current state-of-the-art (Roaring Bitmaps) can be used as an example of the possible gains.\nIn order to make such techniques viable, bitwise primitives are mandatory. Furthermore, succinct data structures are not limited to sets of integers, but all require bitwise operations to be implementable.\nOn-chain, space comes at a premium. One way that space can be saved is with binary representations, which can potentially represent something much closer to the entropy limit, especially if the structure or value being represented has significant redundant structure. While some possibilities for a more efficient 'packing' already exist in the form of BuiltinData, it is rather idiosyncratic to the needs of Plutus, and its decoding is potentially quite costly.\nBuiltinData\nBitwise primitives would allow more compact binary encodings to be defined, where complex structures or values are represented using fixed-size BuiltinByteStrings. The encoders and decoders for these could also be implemented more efficiently than currently possible, as there exist numerous bitwise techniques for this.\nBuiltinByteString\nFor linear structures on-chain, we are currently limited to BuiltinList and BuiltinMap, which don't allow constant-time indexing. This is a significant restriction, especially when many data structures and algorithms rely on the broad availability of a constant-time-indexable linear structure, such as a C array or Haskell Vector. While we could introduce a primitive data type like this, doing so would be a significant undertaking, and would require both implementing and costing a large API.\nBuiltinList\nBuiltinMap\nVector\nWhile for variable-length data, we don't have any alternatives if constant-time indexing is a goal, for fixed-length (or limited-length at least) data, there is a possibility, based on a similar approach taken by the finitary library. Essentially, given finitary data, we can transform any item into a numerical index, which is then stored by embedding into a byte array. As the indexes are of a fixed maximum size, this can be done efficiently, but only if there is a way of converting indices into bitstrings, and vice versa. Such a construction would allow using a (wrapper around) BuiltinByteString as a constant-time indexable structure of any finitary type. This is not much of a restriction in practice, as on-chain, fixed-width or size-bounded types are preferable due to the on-chain size limit.\nfinitary\nBuiltinByteString\nCurrently, all the pieces to make this work already exist: the only missing piece is the ability to convert indices (which would have to be BuiltinIntegers) into bit strings (which would have to be BuiltinByteStrings) and back again. With this capability, it would be possible to use these techniques to implement something like an array or vector without new primitive data types.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nTo ensure a focused and meaningful proposal, we specify our goals below.\nThe primitives provided should enable implementations of algorithms and data structures that are currently impossible or impractical. Furthermore, the primitives provided should have a high power-to-weight ratio: having them should enable as much as possible to be implemented.\nBitwise operations, via Boolean algebras, have a long and storied history of algebraic laws, dating back to important results by the like of de Morgan, Post and many others. These algebraic laws are useful for a range of reasons: they guide implementations, enable easier testing (especially property testing) and in some cases much more efficient implementations. To some extent, they also formalize our intuition about how these operations 'should work'. Thus, maintaining as many of these laws in our implementation as possible, and being clear about them, is important.\nProviding primitives alone is not enough: they should also be efficient. This is not least of all because many would associate 'primitive operation' with a notion of being 'close to the machine', and therefore fast. Thus, it is on us to ensure that the implementations of the primitives we provide have to be implementable in an efficient way, across a range of hardware.\nWhile totality is desirable, in some cases, there isn't a sensible answer for us to give. A good example is a division-by-zero: if we are asked to do such a thing, the only choice we have is to reject it. However, we need to make it as easy as possible for someone to realize why their program is failing, by emitting a sensible message which can later be inspected.\nWe also specify some specific non-goals of this proposal.\nA widespread legacy of C is the mixing of treatment of numbers and blobs of bits: specifically, the allowing of logical operations on representations of numbers. This applies to Haskell as much as any other language: according to the Haskell Report, it is in fact required that any type implementing Bits implement Num first. While GHC Haskell only mandates Eq, it still defines Bits instances for types clearly meant to represent numbers. This is a bad choice, as it creates complex situations and partiality in several cases, for arguably no real gain other than easier translation of bit twiddling code originally written in C.\nBits\nNum\nEq\nBits\nEven if two types share a representation, their type distinctness is meant to be a semantic or abstraction boundary: just because a number is represented as a blob of bits does not necessarily mean that arbitrary bit manipulations are sensible. However, by defining such a capability, we create several semantic problems:\nBuiltinInteger\nBits\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nThese complexities, and many more besides, are poor choices, owing more to the legacy of C than any real useful functionality. Furthermore, they feel like a casual and senseless undermining of type safety and its guarantees for very small and questionable gains. Therefore, defining bitwise operations on BuiltinInteger is not something we wish to support.\nBuiltinInteger\nThere are legitimate cases where a conversion from BuiltinInteger to BuiltinByteString is desirable; this conversion should be provided, and be both explicit and specified in a way that is independent of the machine or the implementation of BuiltinInteger, as well as total and round-tripping. Arguably, it is also desirable to provide built-in support for BuiltinByteString literals specified in a way convenient to their treatment as blobs of bytes (for example, hexadecimal or binary notation), but this is outside the scope of this proposal.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nWe propose several classes of operations. Firstly, we propose two operations for inter-conversion between BuiltinByteString and BuiltinInteger:\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nintegerToByteString :: BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinByteString\nintegerToByteString :: BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinByteString\nConvert a non-negative number to its bitwise representation, erroring if given a negative number.\nbyteStringToInteger :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\nbyteStringToInteger :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\nReinterpret a bitwise representation to its corresponding non-negative number.\nWe also propose several logical operations on BuiltinByteStrings:\nBuiltinByteString\nandByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nandByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nPerform a bitwise logical AND on arguments of the same length, producing a result of the same length, erroring otherwise.\niorByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\niorByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nPerform a bitwise logical IOR on arguments of the same length, producing a result of the same length, erroring otherwise.\nxorByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nxorByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nPerform a bitwise logical XOR on arguments of the same length, producing a result of the same length, erroring otherwise.\ncomplementByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\ncomplementByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nComplement all the bits in the argument, producing a result of the same length.\nLastly, we define the following additional operations:\nshiftByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinByteString\nshiftByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinByteString\nPerforms a bitwise shift of the first argument by a number of bit positions equal to the absolute value of the second argument. A positive second argument indicates a shift towards higher bit indexes; a negative second argument indicates a shift towards lower bit indexes.\nrotateByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinByteString\nrotateByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinByteString\nPerforms a bitwise rotation of the first argument by a number of bit positions equal to the absolute value of the second argument. A positive second argument indicates a rotation towards higher bit indexes; a negative second argument indicates a rotation towards lower bit indexes.\npopCountByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\npopCountByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\nReturns the number of 111 bits in the argument.\ntestBitByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinBool\ntestBitByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinBool\nIf the position given by the second argument is not in bounds for the first argument, error; otherwise, if the bit given by that position is 111, return True, and False otherwise.\nTrue\nFalse\nwriteBitByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinBool -> BuiltinByteString\nwriteBitByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinBool -> BuiltinByteString\nIf the position given by the second argument is not in bounds for the first argument, error; otherwise, set the bit given by that position to 111 if the third argument is True, and 000 otherwise.\nTrue\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\nCounts the initial sequence of 0 bits in the argument (that is, starting from index 0). If the argument is empty, this returns 0.\ncountTrailingZeroesByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\ncountTrailingZeroesByteString :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\nCounts the final sequence of 0 bits in the argument (that is, starting from the 1 bit with the highest index). If the argument is empty, this returns 0.\nWe define N+=x N x 0\\mathbb{N} {+} = \\\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid x \\neq 0 \\\\}N+=x N x =0. We assume that BuiltinInteger is a faithful representation of Z\\mathbb{Z}Z, and will refer to them (and their elements) interchangeably. A byte is some x 0,1, ,255x \\in \\\\{ 0,1,\\ldots,255 \\\\}x 0,1, ,255.\nBuiltinInteger\nWe observe that, given some base b N+b \\in \\mathbb{N} {+}b N+, any n Nn \\in \\mathbb{N}n N can be viewed as a sequence of values in 0,1, ,b 1\\\\{0,1,\\ldots, b - 1\\\\}0,1, ,b 1. We refer to any such sequence as a base bbb sequence. In such a 'view', given a base bbb sequence S=s0s1 skS = s_0 s_1 \\ldots s_kS=s0 s1 sk , we can compute its corresponding m N+m \\in \\mathbb{N} +m N+ as\ni 0,1, ,kbk i si\\sum_{i \\in \\\\{0,1,\\ldots,k\\\\}} b {k - i} \\cdot s_i i 0,1, ,k bk i si\nIf b 1b 1b 1 and ZZZ is a base bbb sequence consisting only of zeroes, we observe that for any other base bbb sequence SSS, Z SZ \\cdot SZ S and SSS correspond to the same number, where \\cdot is sequence concatenation.\nWe use bit sequence to refer to a base 2 sequence, and byte sequence to refer to a base 256 sequence. For a bit sequence S=b0b1 bnS = b_0 b_1 \\ldots b_nS=b0 b1 bn , we refer to 0,1, ,n\\\\{0,1,\\ldots,n \\\\}0,1, ,n as the valid bit indices of SSS; analogously, for a byte sequence T=y0y1 ymT = y_0 y_1 \\ldots y_mT=y0 y1 ym , we refer to 0,1, ,m\\\\{0,1,\\ldots,m\\\\}0,1, ,m as the valid byte indices of TTT. We observe that the length of SSS is n+1n + 1n+1 and the length of TTT is m+1m + 1m+1; we refer to these as the bit length of SSS and the byte length of TTT for clarity. We write S[i]S[i]S[i] and T[j]T[j]T[j] to represent bib_ibi and yjy_jyj for valid bit index iii and valid byte index jjj respectively.\nWe describe a 'view' of bytes as bit sequences. Let yyy be a byte; its corresponding bit sequence is Sy=y0y1y2y3y4y5y6y7S_y = y_0 y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 y_5 y_6 y_7Sy =y0 y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 such that\ni 0,1, ,727 i yi=y\\sum_{i \\in \\\\{0,1,\\ldots,7\\\\}} 2 {7 - i} \\cdot y_i = y i 0,1, ,7 27 i yi =y\nFor example, the byte 555555 has the corresponding byte sequence 001101110011011100110111. For any byte, its corresponding byte sequence is unique. We use this to extend our 'view' to byte sequences as bit sequences. Specifically, let T=y0y1 ymT = y_0 y_1 \\ldots y_mT=y0 y1 ym be a byte sequence. Its corresponding bit sequence S=b0b1 bmbm+1 b8(m+1) 1S = b_0b_1 \\ldots b_m b_{m + 1} \\ldots b_{8(m + 1) - 1}S=b0 b1 bm bm+1 b8(m+1) 1 such that for any valid bit index jjj of SSS, bj=1b_j = 1bj =1 if and only if T[j/8][jmod 8]=1T[j / 8][j \\mod 8] = 1T[j/8][jmod8]=1, and is 000 otherwise.\nBased on the above, we observe that any BuiltinByteString can be a bit sequence or a byte sequence. Furthermore, we assume that indexByteString and sliceByteString 'agree' with valid byte indices. More precisely, suppose bs represents a byte sequence TTT; then indexByteString bs i is seen as equivalent to T[i]T[\\mathtt{i}]T[i]; we extend this notion to sliceByteString analogously. Throughout, we will refer to BuiltinByteStrings and their 'views' as bit or byte sequences interchangeably.\nBuiltinByteString\nindexByteString\nsliceByteString\nbs\nindexByteString bs i\nsliceByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nWe describe the translation of BuiltinInteger into BuiltinByteString, which is implemented as the integerToByteString primitive. Let iii be the argument BuiltinInteger; if this is negative, we produce an error, specifying at least the following:\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nintegerToByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nintegerToByteString\nOtherwise, we produce the BuiltinByteString corresponding to the base 256 sequence which represents iii.\nBuiltinByteString\nWe now describe the reverse operation, implemented as the byteStringToInteger primitive. This treats its argument BuiltinByteString as a base 256 sequence, and produces its corresponding number as a BuiltinInteger. We note that this is necessarily non-negative.\nbyteStringToInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nWe observe that byteStringToInteger 'undoes' integerToByteString:\nbyteStringToInteger\nintegerToByteString\nbyteStringToInteger . integerToByteString = id\nbyteStringToInteger . integerToByteString = id\nThe other direction does not necessarily hold: if the argument to byteStringToInteger contains a prefix consisting only of zeroes, and we convert the resulting BuiltinInteger i back to a BuiltinByteString using integerToByteString, that prefix will be lost.\nbyteStringToInteger\nBuiltinInteger\ni\nBuiltinByteString\nintegerToByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nThroughout, let S=s0s1 snS = s_0 s_1 \\ldots s_nS=s0 s1 sn and T=t0t1 tnT = t_0 t_1 \\ldots t_nT=t0 t1 tn be byte sequences, and let S S {\\prime}S and T T {\\prime}T be their corresponding bit sequences, with bit lengths n +1n {\\prime} + 1n +1 and m +1m {\\prime} + 1m +1 respectively. Whenever we specify a mismatched length error result, its error message must contain at least the following information:\nFor any of andByteString, iorByteString and xorByteString, given inputs SSS and TTT, if n mn \\neq mn =m, the result is an error which must contain at least the following information:\nandByteString\niorByteString\nxorByteString\nIf n=mn = mn=m, the result of each of these operations is the bit sequence U=u0u1 un U = u_0u_1 \\ldots u_{n {\\prime}}U=u0 u1 un , such that for all i 0,1, ,n i \\in \\\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n {\\prime}\\\\}i 0,1, ,n , U[i]=1U[i] = 1U[i]=1 under the following conditions:\nandByteString\niorByteString\nxorByteString\nOtherwise, U[i]=0U[i] = 0U[i]=0.\nWe observe that, for length-matched arguments, each of these operations describes a commutative and associative operation. Furthermore, for any given byte length kkk, each of these operations has an identity element:\nandByteString\nxorByteString\niorByteString\nLastly, andByteString and iorByteString have an absorbing element for each byte length kkk, which is the byte sequence of length kkk where each element is zero and 255 respectively.\nandByteString\niorByteString\nWe now describe the semantics of complementByteString. For input SSS, the result is the bit sequence U=u0u1 un U = u_0 u_1 \\ldots u_{n {\\prime}}U=u0 u1 un such that for all i {0,1, ,n }i \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n {\\prime}\\}i {0,1, ,n }, we have U[i]=0U[i] = 0U[i]=0 if S [i]=1S {\\prime}[i] = 1S [i]=1 and 111 otherwise.\ncomplementByteString\nWe observe that complementByteString is self-inverting. We also note the following equivalences hold assuming b and b' have the same length; these are De Morgan's laws:\ncomplementByteString\nb\nb'\ncomplementByteString (andByteString b b') = iorByteString (complementByteString b) (complementByteString b')\ncomplementByteString (andByteString b b') = iorByteString (complementByteString b) (complementByteString b')\ncomplementByteString (iorByteString b b') = andByteString (complementByteString b) (complementByteString b')\ncomplementByteString (iorByteString b b') = andByteString (complementByteString b) (complementByteString b')\nThroughout, let S=s0s1 snS = s_0 s_1 \\ldots s_nS=s0 s1 sn be a byte sequence, and let S S {\\prime}S be its corresponding bit sequence with bit length n +1n {\\prime} + 1n +1.\nWe describe the semantics of shiftByteString and rotateByteString. Informally, both of these are 'bit index modifiers': given a positive iii, the index of a bit in the result 'increases' relative to the argument, and given a negative iii, the index of a bit in the result 'decreases' relative to the argument. This can mean that for some bit indexes in the result, there is no corresponding bit in the argument: we term these missing indexes. Additionally, by such calculations, a bit index in the argument may be projected to a negative index in the result: we term these out-of-bounds indexes. How we handle missing and out-of-bounds indexes is what distinguishes shiftByteString and rotateByteString:\nshiftByteString\nrotateByteString\nshiftByteString\nrotateByteString\nshiftByteString\nrotateByteString\nWe describe the semantics of shiftByteString precisely. Given arguments SSS and some i Zi \\in \\mathbb{Z}i Z, the result is the bit sequence U=u0u1 un U = u_0 u_1 \\ldots u_{n {\\prime}}U=u0 u1 un such that for all j 0,1, ,n j \\in \\\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n {\\prime}\\\\}j 0,1, ,n , we have U[j]=S [j i]U[j] = S {\\prime}[j - i]U[j]=S [j i] if j ij - ij i is a valid bit index for S S {\\prime}S and 000 otherwise.\nshiftByteString\nLet k, Zk, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}k, Z such that either kkk or \\ell is 000, or kkk and \\ell have the same sign. We observe that, for any bs, we have\nbs\nshiftByteString (shiftBytestring bs k) l = shiftByteString bs (k + l)\nshiftByteString (shiftBytestring bs k) l = shiftByteString bs (k + l)\nWe now describe the semantics of rotateByteString precisely; we assume the same arguments as for shiftByteString above. The result is the bit sequence U=u0u1 un U = u_0 u_1 \\ldots u_{n {\\prime}}U=u0 u1 un such that for all j 0,1, ,n j \\in \\\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n {\\prime}\\\\}j 0,1, ,n , we have U[j]=S [n +j imod n ]U[j] = S {\\prime}[n {\\prime} + j - i \\mod n {\\prime}]U[j]=S [n +j imodn ].\nrotateByteString\nshiftByteString\nWe observe that for any k, k, \\ellk, , and any bs, we have\nbs\nrotateByteString (rotateByteString bs k) l = rotateByteString bs (k + l)\nrotateByteString (rotateByteString bs k) l = rotateByteString bs (k + l)\nWe also note that\nrotateByteString bs 0 = shiftByteString bs 0 = bs\nrotateByteString bs 0 = shiftByteString bs 0 = bs\nLastly, we note that\nrotateByteString bs k = rotateByteString bs (k `remInteger` (lengthByteString bs * 8))\nrotateByteString bs k = rotateByteString bs (k `remInteger` (lengthByteString bs * 8))\nFor popCountByteString with argument SSS, the result is\npopCountByteString\nj 0,1, ,n S [j]\\sum_{j \\in \\\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n {\\prime}\\\\}} S {\\prime}[j] j 0,1, ,n S [j]\nInformally, this is just the total count of 111 bits. We observe that for any bs and bs', we have\nbs\nbs'\npopCountByteString bs + popCountByteString bs' = popCountByteString (appendByteString bs bs')\npopCountByteString bs + popCountByteString bs' = popCountByteString (appendByteString bs bs')\nWe now describe the semantics of testBitByteString and writeBitByteString. Throughout, whenever we specify an out-of-bounds error result, its error message must contain at least the following information:\ntestBitByteString\nwriteBitByteString\nFor testBitByteString with arguments SSS and some i Zi \\in \\mathbb{Z}i Z, if iii is a valid bit index of S S {\\prime}S , the result is True if S [i]=1S {\\prime}[i] = 1S [i]=1, and False if S [i]=0S {\\prime}[i] = 0S [i]=0. If iii is not a valid bit index of S S {\\prime}S , the result is an out-of-bounds error.\ntestBitByteString\nTrue\nFalse\nFor writeBitByteString with arguments SSS, some i Zi \\in \\mathbb{Z}i Z and some BuiltinBool bbb, if iii is not a valid bit index for S S {\\prime}S , the result is an out-of-bounds error. Otherwise, the result is the bit sequence U=u0u1 un U = u_0 u_1 \\ldots u_{n {\\prime}}U=u0 u1 un such that for all j 0,1, ,nj \\in \\\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\\\}j 0,1, ,n, we have:\nwriteBitByteString\nBuiltinBool\nTrue\nFalse\nLastly, we describe the semantics of countLeadingZeroesByteString and countTrailingZeroesByteString. Given the argument SSS, countLeadingZeroesByteString gives the result kkk such that all of the following hold:\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString\ncountTrailingZeroesByteString\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString\nGiven the same argument, countTrailingZeroesByteString instead gives the result kkk such that all of the following hold:\ncountTrailingZeroesByteString\nLet zeroes be a BuiltinByteString consisting only of zero bytes of length len. We observe that\nzeroes\nBuiltinByteString\nlen\ncountTrailingZeroesByteString zeroes = countLeadingZeroesByteString zeroes = len * 8\ncountTrailingZeroesByteString zeroes = countLeadingZeroesByteString zeroes = len * 8\nFurthermore, for two BuiltinByteStrings bs and bs', we have\nBuiltinByteString\nbs\nbs'\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString (iorByteString bs bs') = min (countLeadingZeroesByteString bs) (countLeadingZeroesByteString bs') countTrailingZeroesByteString (iorByteString bs bs') = min (countTrailingZeroesByteString bs) (countTrailingZeroesByteString bs')\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString (iorByteString bs bs') = min (countLeadingZeroesByteString bs) (countLeadingZeroesByteString bs') countTrailingZeroesByteString (iorByteString bs bs') = min (countTrailingZeroesByteString bs) (countTrailingZeroesByteString bs')\nwhere min is the minimum value function.\nmin\nAll of the primitives we describe are linear in one of their arguments. For a more precise description, see the table below.\nintegerToByteString\nbyteStringToInteger\nandByteString\niorByteString\nxorByteString\ncomplementByteString\nshiftByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nrotateByteString\nBuiltinByteString\npopCountByteString\ntestBitByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nwriteBitByteString\nBuiltinByteString\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString\ncountTrailingZeroesByteString\nFor work in finite field arithmetic (and the areas it enables), we frequently need to move between the 'worlds' of BuiltinInteger and BuiltinByteString. This needs to be consistent, and allow round-trips. We simplify this by only requiring conversions work on non-negative integers: this means that the translations can be simpler and more efficient, and also avoids representational questions for negative numbers.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nOur choice of logical AND, IOR, XOR and complement as the primary logical operations is driven by a mixture of prior art, utility and convenience. These are the typical bitwise logical operations provided in hardware, and in most programming languages; for example, in the x86 instruction set, the following bitwise operations have existed since the 8086:\nAND\nOR\nNOT\nXOR\nLikewise, on the ARM instruction set, the following bitwise operations have existed since ARM2:\nAND\nORR\nEOR\nORN\nBIC\nGoing 'up a level', the C and Forth programming languages (according to C89 and ANS Forth respectively) define bitwise AND (denoted & and AND respectively), bitwise IOR (denoted | and OR respectively), bitwise XOR (denoted and XOR respectively) and bitwise complement (denoted ~ and NOT respectively) as primitive bitwise operations. These choices are mirrored by basically all 'high-level' languages; for example, Haskell's Bits type class defines these same four operations as .&., .|., xor and complement respectively.\n&\nAND\n|\nOR\n^\nXOR\n~\nNOT\nBits\n.&.\n.|.\nxor\ncomplement\nThis ubiquity in choices leads to most algorithm descriptions that rely on bitwise operations to assume that these specific four operations are 'primitive', implying that they are constant-time and constant-cost. While we could reduce the number of primitive bitwise operations (and, in fact, due to Post, we know that there exist two operations that can implement all of them), this would be both inconvenient and inefficient. As an example, consider implementing XOR using AND, IOR and complement: this would translate x XOR y into\nx XOR y\n(COMPLEMENT x AND y) IOR (x AND COMPLEMENT y)\n(COMPLEMENT x AND y) IOR (x AND COMPLEMENT y)\nThis is both needlessly complex, and also inefficient, as it requires copying the arguments twice, only to then throw away both copies. This is less of a concern if copying is 'cheap', but given that we need to operate on variable-width data (specifically BuiltinByteStrings), this seems needlessly wasteful.\nBuiltinByteString\nLike our 'baseline' bitwise operations above, shifts and rotations are widely used, and considered as primitive. For example, x86 platforms have had the following available since the 8086:\nRCL\nRCR\nSHL\nSHR\nLikewise, ARM platforms have had the following available since ARM2:\nROR\nLSL\nLSR\nWhile C and Forth both have shifts (denoted with and in C, and LSHIFT and RSHIFT in Forth), they don't have rotations; however, many higher-level languages do: Haskell's Bits type class has rotate, which enables both left and right rotations.\n<<\n>>\nLSHIFT\nRSHIFT\nBits\nrotate\nWhile popCountByteString could in theory be simulated using testBitByteString and a fold, this is quite inefficient: the best way to simulate this operation would involve using something similar to the Harley-Seal algorithm, which requires a large lookup table, making it impractical on-chain. Furthermore, population counting is important for several classes of succinct data structure (particularly rank-select dictionaries and bitmaps), and is in fact provided as part of the SSE4.2 x86 instruction set as a primitive named POPCNT.\npopCountByteString\ntestBitByteString\nSSE4.2\nPOPCNT\nIn order to usefully manipulate individual bits, both testBitByteString and writeBitByteString are needed. They can also be used as part of specifying, and verifying, that other bitwise operations, both primitive and non-primitive, are behaving correctly. They are also particularly essential for binary encodings.\ntestBitByteString\nwriteBitByteString\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString and countTrailingZeroesByteString is an essential primitive for several succinct data structures: both Roaring Bitmaps and rank-select dictionaries rely on them for much of their usefulness. For finite field arithmetic, these instructions are also beneficial to have available as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, this operation is provided in hardware by several instruction sets: on x86, there exist (at least) BSF, BSR, LZCNT and TZCNT, while on ARM, we have CLZ for counting leading zeroes. These instructions also exist in higher-level languages: for example, GHC's FiniteBits type class has countTrailingZeros and countLeadingZeros. Lastly, while they can be emulated by testBitByteString, this is tedious, error-prone and extremely slow.\ncountLeadingZeroesByteString\ncountTrailingZeroesByteString\nBSF\nBSR\nLZCNT\nTZCNT\nCLZ\nFiniteBits\ncountTrailingZeros\ncountLeadingZeros\ntestBitByteString\nAt the Plutus Core level, implementing this proposal introduces no backwards-incompatibility: the proposed new primitives do not break any existing functionality or affect any other builtins. Likewise, at levels above Plutus Core (such as PlutusTx), no existing functionality should be affected.\nPlutusTx\nOn-chain, this requires a hard fork, as this introduces new primitives.\nMLabs will implement these primitives, as well as tests for these. Costing will have to be done after this is complete, but must be done by the Plutus Core team, due to limitations in how costing is performed.\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0059?",
    "completion": "This CIP seeks to clarify the language around groups of features. At the very least, it provides some history.\nWhen @CharlesHoskinson conceived of Cardano, he had a vision for what features the network would support. This vision is still present on the Cardano roadmap website. In particular, the features are grouped into \"phases\", which are mostly named after poets (Goguen is the exception). The word \"era\" is used interchangeably with \"phases\" on the roadmap.\nThe word \"era\", however, has been muddled by an implementation detail in the Cardano ledger. The Shelley phase was implemented as an entire re-write of the code from the Byron phase. While the consensus layer for the Shelley phase was written with an abstraction in place for the ledger, the ledger layer was not written with any abstractions to make future phases possible.\nUpon starting into the Goguen phase, the ledger team retroactively introduce a notion of \"era\" into the ledger code, and deemed the Shelley features \"the Shelley era\". In hindsight, however, the word \"era\" in unfortunate, since the Goguen phase was completed in the ledger by what was called \"the Allegra era, the Mary era, the Alonzo era, and the Babbage era\".\nThe names Allegra and Mary were chosen for their connection to the poet Percy Shelley, and were only intended to be used as variable names for a very specific abstraction used in the ledger code. (The story is even a bit more confusing, since the Allegra and Mary era share a lot of code and are specified together in the \"Shelley-MA specification. The letters \"MA\" can hilariously refer to both \"Mary Allegra\" and \"Multi-Assets\".)\nHow did we then go from poets to Alonzo? Recall that \"Goguen\" was the only non-poet named in the phases on the Cardano roadmap. We found it fitting, therefore, to name the ledger era which introduced Plutus after the person who invented the lambda calculus (Plutus Core uses a variant of system F.).\nMoreover, going forward, we decided to use names in A, B, C, ... order, names coming from other people who walk the line between mathematics and computer science. One lack of consistency to notice is that we have used both first and last names. The inconsistency was mostly driven by the desire to find short and memorable names.\nAnother complication to the story is the notion of \"intra-era hard forks\". A new era must be introduced with a hard fork, but the ledger can also change semantics during a controlled hard fork with another mechanism, namely an intra-era hard fork. This is an implementation detail which involves bumping the major protocol version but not creating a new ledger era. The Alonzo era experienced an intra-era hard fork when going from major protocol version 5 to 6.\nYet another complication stems from the named releases. We chose to honor the late Cardano community member and Bulgarian mathematician Vasil Dabov by naming a release date after him. The ledger era after the Alonzo era was named Babbage. Babbage is a feature set, Vasil is a release date which ushered in the Babbage era.\nLastly, it is important to understand that not all of the semantic changes to the Cardano network involve the ledger, though the changes to the ledger are often the most user-facing. Changes to the consensus protocol or the networking layer may also involve a hard fork. Moreover, there is an abstraction that sits between the consensus and ledger layers, which we have named the \"protocol\" (a regrettably vague name).\nThe distinction between the ledger protocols and the ledger eras correspond roughly to how block headers are validated (protocol) versus how block bodies are validated (era). The Shelley era used the \"transitional Praos\" protocol (or TPraos for short). It consisted of Praos together with a transition system to move away from Ouroboros-BFT. The Babbage era replaced TPraos with Praos.\nA table of all the features, as of the time this CIP was submitted, can be found here.\nNote that the protocol version mentioned above is unrelated to the node-to-node and node-to-client protocol versions. The consensus layer maintains a versioning scheme for the node queries which does not necessarily align with the protocol version described in this CIP.\nNote also that the protocol version present inside of each block header indicates the maximum supported protocol version that the block producer is capable of supporting (see section 13, Software Updates, of the Shelley ledger specification).\nLet us use the following language:\nIf we can agree to common language, it will greatly improve communication among ourselves and also with new community members.\nSince this is an issue of language, we will strive to use consistent language going forward, and we can correct misalignment when we find it.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This proposal defines an extension to CIP-25 and CIP-68 for token metadata specific to music tokens.\nMusic tokens on Cardano can be either NFTs or FTs and contain links to audio files. In order for players, indexers, and wallets to be able to properly search and categorize a user's music collection, we need to define a common schema for creating music on Cardano. If all parties creating these music tokens follow similar patterns, apps can consume this information and make proper use of it. The existing CIP-25 is a good base to build upon, but for a good music experience, we need to standardize additional fields that will be required specifically for music tokens.\nThis CIP divides the additional metadata parameters into two categories of Required and Optional. When minting a music token on Cardano, you are expected to include ALL of the required fields. If you choose to include one or more of the optional fields, they must be named exactly as defined in this CIP. This will properly allow indexing apps and music players to utilize as much of your token metadata as possible without issues.\nRequired\nOptional\nCDDL Spec Version 3 CDDL Spec Version 2 (deprecated) CDDL Spec Version 1 (deprecated)\nIn version 2 of the CIP-60 spec, album_title has been renamed to release_title. release is a more generic name that covers all types of releases from Albums, EPs, LPs, Singles, and Compilations. At the top level, we are grouping those metadata items that relate to the release under a new key release. At the file for each song, there is a new song key that holds the metadata specific to the individual song. These changes separate the music-specific metadata from the general CIP-25/CIP-68 NFT metadata. A music player can look at just the information necessary instead of having to ignore extra NFT-related fields. CIP-68 NFTs are officially supported and an example specific to CIP-68 has been added below.\nalbum_title\nrelease_title\nrelease\nrelease\nsong\nVersion 3 reorders identifiers like IPN, ISNI, etc into objects tied with the entities they are associated with. contributing_artists, artists, and featured_artists fields are explicitly defined to reduce interpretation. ipi array replaced with author array, which includes ipi key.

It greatly simplifies the work that apps have to make when consuming such tokens.\nThis CIP is the result of several online meetings between many different companies building music-related projects on top of Cardano. These meetings were organized as many in the community started to see fragmentation in the way music NFTs were being minted on Cardano. These meetings gave the opportunity for a bit of a reset and will allow a much brighter future for music on Cardano. As long as all projects agree on some of these basic fields, there is great flexibility in this CIP to do application-specific unique things on top of the music NFT itself. The CIP is intentionally open-ended and can be updated in future versions if there are additional fields that the wider group could benefit from.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0067?",
    "completion": "This proposal defines a standard to identify Cardano native assets by the asset name to put them in an asset class, as intended by their issuer.\nAs more assets are minted and different standards emerge to query data for these assets, it's getting harder for 3rd parties to determine the asset class and associated extra assumptions that may arise from this identification. For example, if an asset is identified as a non-fungible token, a third party is interested in its onchain associated metadata. This standard is similar to CIP-0010, but focuses on the asset name of a native asset.\nTo give issuers the option to classify assets, the asset_name MUST be prefixed with 4 bytes encoding the following binary value:\nasset_name\n[ 0000 | 16 bits label_num | 8 bits checksum | 0000 ]\n[ 0000 | 16 bits label_num | 8 bits checksum | 0000 ]\nlabel_num\nLabel range in decimal: [0, 65535]\nlabel_num\nchecksum\nlabel_num (including the padded 0s)\n0x07\n[ 0x00, 0x07, 0x0e, 0x09, 0x1c, 0x1b, 0x12, 0x15, 0x38, 0x3f, 0x36, 0x31, 0x24, 0x23, 0x2a, 0x2d, 0x70, 0x77, 0x7e, 0x79, 0x6c, 0x6b, 0x62, 0x65, 0x48, 0x4f, 0x46, 0x41, 0x54, 0x53, 0x5a, 0x5d, 0xe0, 0xe7, 0xee, 0xe9, 0xfc, 0xfb, 0xf2, 0xf5, 0xd8, 0xdf, 0xd6, 0xd1, 0xc4, 0xc3, 0xca, 0xcd, 0x90, 0x97, 0x9e, 0x99, 0x8c, 0x8b, 0x82, 0x85, 0xa8, 0xaf, 0xa6, 0xa1, 0xb4, 0xb3, 0xba, 0xbd, 0xc7, 0xc0, 0xc9, 0xce, 0xdb, 0xdc, 0xd5, 0xd2, 0xff, 0xf8, 0xf1, 0xf6, 0xe3, 0xe4, 0xed, 0xea, 0xb7, 0xb0, 0xb9, 0xbe, 0xab, 0xac, 0xa5, 0xa2, 0x8f, 0x88, 0x81, 0x86, 0x93, 0x94, 0x9d, 0x9a, 0x27, 0x20, 0x29, 0x2e, 0x3b, 0x3c, 0x35, 0x32, 0x1f, 0x18, 0x11, 0x16, 0x03, 0x04, 0x0d, 0x0a, 0x57, 0x50, 0x59, 0x5e, 0x4b, 0x4c, 0x45, 0x42, 0x6f, 0x68, 0x61, 0x66, 0x73, 0x74, 0x7d, 0x7a, 0x89, 0x8e, 0x87, 0x80, 0x95, 0x92, 0x9b, 0x9c, 0xb1, 0xb6, 0xbf, 0xb8, 0xad, 0xaa, 0xa3, 0xa4, 0xf9, 0xfe, 0xf7, 0xf0, 0xe5, 0xe2, 0xeb, 0xec, 0xc1, 0xc6, 0xcf, 0xc8, 0xdd, 0xda, 0xd3, 0xd4, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x67, 0x60, 0x75, 0x72, 0x7b, 0x7c, 0x51, 0x56, 0x5f, 0x58, 0x4d, 0x4a, 0x43, 0x44, 0x19, 0x1e, 0x17, 0x10, 0x05, 0x02, 0x0b, 0x0c, 0x21, 0x26, 0x2f, 0x28, 0x3d, 0x3a, 0x33, 0x34, 0x4e, 0x49, 0x40, 0x47, 0x52, 0x55, 0x5c, 0x5b, 0x76, 0x71, 0x78, 0x7f, 0x6a, 0x6d, 0x64, 0x63, 0x3e, 0x39, 0x30, 0x37, 0x22, 0x25, 0x2c, 0x2b, 0x06, 0x01, 0x08, 0x0f, 0x1a, 0x1d, 0x14, 0x13, 0xae, 0xa9, 0xa0, 0xa7, 0xb2, 0xb5, 0xbc, 0xbb, 0x96, 0x91, 0x98, 0x9f, 0x8a, 0x8d, 0x84, 0x83, 0xde, 0xd9, 0xd0, 0xd7, 0xc2, 0xc5, 0xcc, 0xcb, 0xe6, 0xe1, 0xe8, 0xef, 0xfa, 0xfd, 0xf4, 0xf3, ]\n[ 0x00, 0x07, 0x0e, 0x09, 0x1c, 0x1b, 0x12, 0x15, 0x38, 0x3f, 0x36, 0x31, 0x24, 0x23, 0x2a, 0x2d, 0x70, 0x77, 0x7e, 0x79, 0x6c, 0x6b, 0x62, 0x65, 0x48, 0x4f, 0x46, 0x41, 0x54, 0x53, 0x5a, 0x5d, 0xe0, 0xe7, 0xee, 0xe9, 0xfc, 0xfb, 0xf2, 0xf5, 0xd8, 0xdf, 0xd6, 0xd1, 0xc4, 0xc3, 0xca, 0xcd, 0x90, 0x97, 0x9e, 0x99, 0x8c, 0x8b, 0x82, 0x85, 0xa8, 0xaf, 0xa6, 0xa1, 0xb4, 0xb3, 0xba, 0xbd, 0xc7, 0xc0, 0xc9, 0xce, 0xdb, 0xdc, 0xd5, 0xd2, 0xff, 0xf8, 0xf1, 0xf6, 0xe3, 0xe4, 0xed, 0xea, 0xb7, 0xb0, 0xb9, 0xbe, 0xab, 0xac, 0xa5, 0xa2, 0x8f, 0x88, 0x81, 0x86, 0x93, 0x94, 0x9d, 0x9a, 0x27, 0x20, 0x29, 0x2e, 0x3b, 0x3c, 0x35, 0x32, 0x1f, 0x18, 0x11, 0x16, 0x03, 0x04, 0x0d, 0x0a, 0x57, 0x50, 0x59, 0x5e, 0x4b, 0x4c, 0x45, 0x42, 0x6f, 0x68, 0x61, 0x66, 0x73, 0x74, 0x7d, 0x7a, 0x89, 0x8e, 0x87, 0x80, 0x95, 0x92, 0x9b, 0x9c, 0xb1, 0xb6, 0xbf, 0xb8, 0xad, 0xaa, 0xa3, 0xa4, 0xf9, 0xfe, 0xf7, 0xf0, 0xe5, 0xe2, 0xeb, 0xec, 0xc1, 0xc6, 0xcf, 0xc8, 0xdd, 0xda, 0xd3, 0xd4, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x67, 0x60, 0x75, 0x72, 0x7b, 0x7c, 0x51, 0x56, 0x5f, 0x58, 0x4d, 0x4a, 0x43, 0x44, 0x19, 0x1e, 0x17, 0x10, 0x05, 0x02, 0x0b, 0x0c, 0x21, 0x26, 0x2f, 0x28, 0x3d, 0x3a, 0x33, 0x34, 0x4e, 0x49, 0x40, 0x47, 0x52, 0x55, 0x5c, 0x5b, 0x76, 0x71, 0x78, 0x7f, 0x6a, 0x6d, 0x64, 0x63, 0x3e, 0x39, 0x30, 0x37, 0x22, 0x25, 0x2c, 0x2b, 0x06, 0x01, 0x08, 0x0f, 0x1a, 0x1d, 0x14, 0x13, 0xae, 0xa9, 0xa0, 0xa7, 0xb2, 0xb5, 0xbc, 0xbb, 0x96, 0x91, 0x98, 0x9f, 0x8a, 0x8d, 0x84, 0x83, 0xde, 0xd9, 0xd0, 0xd7, 0xc2, 0xc5, 0xcc, 0xcb, 0xe6, 0xe1, 0xe8, 0xef, 0xfa, 0xfd, 0xf4, 0xf3, ]\nWe want to use the decimal label 222 for an asset name:\n222\n0x00de\n0x14\n0x000de140\nWe have the following asset name: 0x000de140\n0x000de140\n0x000de140\n0b0000\n0x0\nlabel_num\nchecksum\nvalid\n0x00de\n222\nThese are the reserved asset_name_label values\nasset_name_label\nasset_name_label\nThe keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this section are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\nThose wishing to propose an addition to this registry MUST draft a new CIP describing the standard for implementing the token. Once the CIP has achieved the Under Review status the proposer SHALL make the necessary edits to registry.json. These changes SHOULD be submitted under a separate pull request against the CIP repository and include a brief description of the standard and a link to the CIP Pull Request describing implementation details.\nUnder Review\nKeys represent labels in decimal numbers.

Since the identification of these native assets is done by third parties, the design is focused on the usability for them.\nFirst, the label should be quickly parsable with a first check. That is, an initial check on an asset name that is easy and will exclude a big subset of the available token names that do not follow standard. This is why the label starts and ends with 0000 in bits. Additionally, in its hex notation, this is differentiable by a human in its readable form, a more common representation.\n0000\nSecondly, the remaining verification on whether a certain asset_name_label standard is followed should be a one shot calculation. Here we mean that the calculation of the check should be straightforward, the label should not be fitted via brute force by a third party. That's why the label contains the bit representation of the integer label it tries to follow.\nasset_name_label\nAnother thing that is important to understand is that an oblivious token issuer might not be aware of this standard. This could lead to the unintentional misinterpretation by third parties and injection attacks. We can minimize this attack vector by making the label format obscure. That is why the label also contains a checksum derived from the asset_name_label to add characters that are deterministically derived but look like nonsense. Together with the above zero \"brackets\", and the fixed size binary encoding, it make it unlikely someone follows this standard accidentally. The CRC-8 checksum is chosen for it low-impact on resources and its readily available implementations in multiple languages.\nasset_name_label\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0068?",
    "completion": "This proposal defines a metadata standard for native assets making use of output datums not only for NFTs but any asset class.\nThis proposal addresses a few shortcomings of CIP-0025:\nBesides these shortcomings CIP-0025 has some flaws in its design. For people unaware of CIP-0025 or want to use a different way of minting or want to use a different metadata format/mechanism you open up a protocol to metadata spoofing, because this standard is so established and metadata in minting transactions are interpreted by most platforms by default. Since this standard is not enforced at the protocol level there is no guarantee everyone will be aware of it or follow the rules. At the same time you limit and constraint the capabilities of the ledger if everyone was forced to follow the rules of CIP-0025.\nThis standard tackles all these problems and offers many more advantages, not only for NFTs, but also for any asset class that may follow. Additionally, this CIP will introduce a way to classify tokens so that third parties like wallets can easily know what the kind of token it is.\nThe basic idea is to have two assets issued, where one references the other. We call these two a reference NFT and an user token, where the user token can be an NFT, FT or any other asset class that is transferable and represents any value. So, the user token is the actual asset that lives in a user's wallet.\nreference NFT\nuser token\nuser token\nuser token\nTo find the metadata for the user token you need to look for the output, where the reference NFT is locked in. How this is done concretely will become clear below. Moreover, this output contains a datum, which holds the metadata. The advantage of this approach is that the issuer of the assets can decide how the transaction output with the reference NFT is locked and further handled. If the issuer wants complete immutable metadata, the reference NFT can be locked at the address of an unspendable script. Similarly, if the issuer wants the NFTs/FTs to evolve or wants a mechanism to update the metadata, the reference NFT can be locked at the address of a script with arbitrary logic that the issuer decides.\nuser token\nreference NFT\nreference NFT\nreference NFT\nreference NFT\nLastly and most importantly, with this construction, the metadata can be used by a Plutus V2 script with the use of reference inputs CIP-0031. This will drive further innovation in the token space.\nEach asset name must be prefixed by a label. The intent of this label is to identify the purpose of the token. For example, a reference NFT is identified by the label 100 and so every token considered a reference NFT should start its asset name with the hex 000643b0. This is following CIP-0067, which specifies how the label prefix should be formatted.\n000643b0\nExamples of asset names:\nFor simplicity purposes, the document will use the label (100) or ( label ) in the following documentation, but understand it should follow the CIP-0067 specification.\n(100)\n(<label>)\nThis is the registered asset_name_label value\nasset_name_label\nFor a correct relationship between the user token and the reference NFT a few conditions MUST be met.\nuser token\nreference NFT\nuser token\nreference NFT\nuser token\nreference NFT\nuser token\nreference NFT\nasset_name_label\nSome remarks about the above,\nuser token\nreference NFT\nuser tokens\nreference NFT\nThe datum in the output with the reference NFT contains the metadata at the first field of the constructor 0. The version number is at the second field of this constructor. The third field allows for arbitrary plutus data. This could be useful to forward relevant data to the plutus script:\nreference NFT\nbig_int = int / big_uint / big_nint big_uint = #6.2(bounded_bytes) big_nint = #6.3(bounded_bytes) metadata = { * metadata => metadata } / [ * metadata ] / big_int / bounded_bytes version = int ; Custom user defined plutus data. ; Setting data is optional, but the field is required ; and needs to be at least Unit/Void: #6.121([]) extra = plutus_data datum = #6.121([metadata, version, extra])\nbig_int = int / big_uint / big_nint big_uint = #6.2(bounded_bytes) big_nint = #6.3(bounded_bytes) metadata = { * metadata => metadata } / [ * metadata ] / big_int / bounded_bytes version = int ; Custom user defined plutus data. ; Setting data is optional, but the field is required ; and needs to be at least Unit/Void: #6.121([]) extra = plutus_data datum = #6.121([metadata, version, extra])\nNote Since version = 1\nversion >= 1\nBesides the necessary standard for the reference NFT we're introducing three specific token standards in this CIP. Note that the possibilities are endless here and more standards can be built on top of this CIP for FTs, other NFTs, rich fungible tokens, etc. The first is the 222 NFT standard with the registered asset_name_label prefix value\nreference NFT\n222\nasset_name_label\nThe user token represents an NFT (non-fungible token).\nuser token\nThe user token and reference NFT MUST have an identical name, preceded by the asset_name_label prefix.\nuser token\nreference NFT\nasset_name_label\nExample: user token: (222)Test123 reference NFT: (100)Test123\nuser token\n(222)Test123\nreference NFT\n(100)Test123\nThis is a low-level representation of the metadata, following closely the structure of CIP-0025.

One way to achieve that is by adding an NFT (reference NFT) to the UTxO. This NFT needs to under the same Policy ID as the user token, followed by an asset name pattern defined in the standard. This way you create a secure link between reference NFT and user token without the need for any extra data, and you can make use of this off-chain and on-chain.\nreference NFT\nuser token\nreference NFT\nuser token\nThe security for the link is derived from the minting policy itself, so it's important to write the validator with the right constraints and rules since this CIP solely defines the interface to keep flexibility as high as possible.\nTo keep metadata compatibility with changes coming in the future, we introduce a version field in the datum.\nversion\nversion\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This CIP unifies the arguments given to all types of Plutus scripts currently available (spending, certifying, rewarding, minting) by removing the argument of a datum.\nFor a while now every builder, myself included have struggled with the mutual dependency issue (two validators that need to know each other's hash) when designing dapps and it is widely considered a substantial barrier to safe protocols and one that limits our design space considerably.\nThe exact change would be to have every validator take as argument the redeemer and then the script context. Datums, only relevant to locking validators would be able to be provided by either looking them up in the ScriptContext or by extending the Spending constructor of TxInfo to carry (TxOutRef, Datum).\nSpending\nTxInfo\n(TxOutRef, Datum)\nAs it stands the scripts being made on cardano often suffer this problem, and the tokens usually are made to be able to be minted at any time. This leads to further checks being made on the frontend and further fragilitiy of the systems we create. When a mutual dependency arises we are forced to choose which script gets to statically know what's the hash of the other, and which has to be provided 'during runtime'.\nUse Case 1: Minting validator checks datum given to spending validator. The spending validator requires the token be present as witness of the datum's correctness.\nUse Case 2 (taken from Optim's Liquidity Bonds): Unique NFT is minted to give a unique identifier to a loan, that then gets reused by Bond Tokens. The spending validators require that NFT be present.\nUse Case 3 (taken from Minswap's Dex V1): NFT is minted for the same reason as above. It allows a minting policy to later mint LP tokens with that unique id token name.\nWe see a similar pattern repeating over and over again as witnessed by dapp developers and auditors alike. By allowing the multi-purpose scripts (spending and any other) we increase the security of Cardano by giving us more confidence and allowing to design protocols that have their architecture driven by Cardano's features, not limited by Cardano's language.\nThis primarily manifests in the ability to use a single validator for both minting and spending but the proposed solution makes it possible to use one validator for any and all purposes at once.\nOne of the major footguns of Plutus scripts is if a user sends to the script with a wrong or missing datum. This has happened in the case of the Nami wallet having a bug that caused the wrong address to be chosen. There are other instances of user error where they send from a CEX to a script address. A wrong datum can be handled by the Plutus scripts themselves by having an alternative execution branch if type does not match the expected datum type. But in the case of no datum the script is not run and fails in phase 1 validation. The other motivation of this CIP is to be able to create spend scripts that can handle the no datum case.\nI see three major use cases when it comes to running spend scripts without datums:\nUse Case 1: A script that acts as a wallet for users. By having no datum spending the user can send directly from exchanges or have friends send to their smart contract wallet with no datum needed.\nUse Case 2: As a DAO treasury. The funds in this script would be controlled by a DAO and anyone can donate/contribute to the DAO without a datum.\nUse Case 3: Allow dApp protocols to have a claim or withdraw mechanism (similar to Ethereum for tokens sent to a contract without call) for claiming tokens sent without a datum.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention CIP-0112 which has been expanded to improve native script capabilities to provide an alternative solution for use case 1 and 2. But for use case 3, CIP-0112 does not enable a \"claim or withdraw mechanism\" for contracts.\nAll the script purposes have a form of Redeemer - ScriptContext - a except the Spending one. It has the following form: Datum - Redeemer - ScriptContext - a. This is enforced by the Cardano ledger.\nRedeemer -> ScriptContext -> a\nDatum -> Redeemer -> ScriptContext -> a\nWe propose to make the following modification:\nThe signature of all scripts will be ScriptContext - a. The ScriptInfo type is a union type with a variant for each script purpose. It is the same as ScriptPurpose, except for the additional optional datum in spending scripts.\nScriptContext -> a\nScriptInfo\nScriptPurpose\n-- | The context that the currently-executing script can access. data ScriptContext = ScriptContext { scriptContextTxInfo :: TxInfo -- ^ information about the transaction the currently-executing script is included in , scriptContextRedeemer :: V2.Redeemer -- ^ Redeemer for the currently-executing script , scriptContextScriptInfo :: ScriptInfo -- ^ the purpose of the currently-executing script, along with information associated -- with the purpose } -- | Like `ScriptPurpose` but with an optional datum for spending scripts. data ScriptInfo = MintingScript V2.CurrencySymbol | SpendingScript V3.TxOutRef (Haskell.Maybe V2.Datum) | RewardingScript V2.Credential | CertifyingScript Haskell.Integer -- ^ 0-based index of the given `TxCert` in `txInfoTxCerts` TxCert | VotingScript Voter | ProposingScript Haskell.Integer -- ^ 0-based index of the given `ProposalProcedure` in `txInfoProposalProcedures` ProposalProcedure\n-- | The context that the currently-executing script can access. data ScriptContext = ScriptContext { scriptContextTxInfo :: TxInfo -- ^ information about the transaction the currently-executing script is included in , scriptContextRedeemer :: V2.Redeemer -- ^ Redeemer for the currently-executing script , scriptContextScriptInfo :: ScriptInfo -- ^ the purpose of the currently-executing script, along with information associated -- with the purpose } -- | Like `ScriptPurpose` but with an optional datum for spending scripts. data ScriptInfo = MintingScript V2.CurrencySymbol | SpendingScript V3.TxOutRef (Haskell.Maybe V2.Datum) | RewardingScript V2.Credential | CertifyingScript Haskell.Integer -- ^ 0-based index of the given `TxCert` in `txInfoTxCerts` TxCert | VotingScript Voter | ProposingScript Haskell.Integer -- ^ 0-based index of the given `ProposalProcedure` in `txInfoProposalProcedures` ProposalProcedure\nThe datum in SpendingScript is optional, which will allow the execution of spending scripts without a datum. One more change will be needed on the ledger side in order to make the Datum optional for spending scripts. The ledger UTXOW rule needs to be relaxed, this ledger rule checks if a utxo has an existing datum if the address's payment credential is a phase 2 validation script.\nSpendingScript\nThe ScriptPurpose type used in the Redeemers Map is left the same. It is used to uniquely identify a Plutus script within a transaction.\nUnifying of the script signature is a very elegant solution to the problem, streamlining the experience of developing on cardano. It begs the question if it should be added as an argument to all validators, to further emphasize that fact.\nThis CIP turns all scripts into 1 arg scripts with a Script Context union type for each purpose.\nThis change is not backwards compatible; it must be introduced in a new Plutus language version. Node code must be modified.\nThe Cardano Ledger and Cardano Plutus teams would need to implement this in following repositories: IntersectMBO/plutus IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger\nThe following languages that compile to uplc would need to update to support the new ScriptContext argument that is passed in for the next Plutus Version: Aiken Helios Opshin Plu-ts Plutarch Scalus\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This proposal uses plutus minting policies to create valid \"ballots\" that are sent alongside datum \"votes\" to a centralized smart contract \"ballot box\" in order to perform verifiable on-chain voting in NFT projects that do not have a governance token.\nThis proposal is intended to provide a standard mechanism for non-fungible token (NFT) projects to perform on-chain verifiable votes using only their NFT assets. There are several proposed solutions for governance that involve using either a service provider (e.g., Summon) with native assets or the issuance of proprietary native assets. However, there are several issues with these approaches:\nThis standard provides a simple solution for this by using the underlying NFT to mint a one-time \"ballot\" token that can be used only for a specific voting topic. Projects that adopt this standard will be able to integrate with web viewers that track projects' governance votes and will also receive the benefits of verifiable on-chain voting without requiring issuance of a new native token.\nWe anticipate some potential use cases:\nWarning This specification is not intended for for governance against fungible tokens that cannot be labeled individually.\nThe basic analogy here is that of a traditional state or federal vote. Imagine a citizen who has a state ID (e.g., Driver's License) and wants to vote, as well as a central voting authority that counts all the ballots.\nThis specification follows the same process, but using tokens:\nNote Because of the efficient UTxO model Cardano employs, steps #1 through #4 occur in a single transaction.\nEvery holder that participates in the vote will have their project NFT in a wallet that can be spent from (either hardware or software, typically accessed via CIP-30). To create a ballot, the voting authority will create a Plutus minting policy with a specific combination of:\ntype BallotMintingPolicy = { referencePolicyId: MintingPolicyHash, // Reference policy ID of the original NFT project pollsClose: Time, // Polls close (as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds) assetNameMapping: func(ByteArray) -> ByteArray // Some function (potentially identity) to map reference NFT name 1-for-1 to ballot NFT name };\ntype BallotMintingPolicy = { referencePolicyId: MintingPolicyHash, // Reference policy ID of the original NFT project pollsClose: Time, // Polls close (as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds) assetNameMapping: func(ByteArray) -> ByteArray // Some function (potentially identity) to map reference NFT name 1-for-1 to ballot NFT name };\nThis Plutus minting policy will perform the following checks:\nFor the voter, each vote they wish to cast will require creating a separate \"ballot\" NFT. In the process, their reference NFT never leaves the original wallet. Sample Helios language pseudocode (functions elided for space) is as follows:\nfunc main(redeemer: Redeemer, ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool { tx: Tx = ctx.tx; minted_policy: MintingPolicyHash = ctx.get_current_minting_policy_hash(); redeemer.switch { Mint => { polls_are_still_open(tx.time_range) && ballots_are_validly_minted(tx.minted, minted_policy, tx.outputs) && assets_locked_in_ballot_box(tx, tx.minted) }, // Burn code elided for space... } }\nfunc main(redeemer: Redeemer, ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool { tx: Tx = ctx.tx; minted_policy: MintingPolicyHash = ctx.get_current_minting_policy_hash(); redeemer.switch { Mint => { polls_are_still_open(tx.time_range) && ballots_are_validly_minted(tx.minted, minted_policy, tx.outputs) && assets_locked_in_ballot_box(tx, tx.minted) }, // Burn code elided for space... } }\nNote ballots_are_validly_minted() includes all required and custom checks (e.g., the holder has sent the reference NFT to themselves in tx.outputs) to validate newly minted ballots\nballots_are_validly_minted()\ntx.outputs\nTo cast the vote, the user sends the ballot NFT just created to a \"ballot box\". Note that for reasons specified in the \"attacks\" section below this needs to occur during the same transaction that the ballot was minted in.\nThe datum is a simple object representing the voter who cast the vote and the vote itself:\ntype VoteDatum = { voter: PubKeyHash, vote: object };\ntype VoteDatum = { voter: PubKeyHash, vote: object };\nThe voter element is extremely important in this datum so that we know who minted the ballot NFT and who we should return it to. At the end of the ballot counting process, this user will receive their ballot NFT back.\nvoter\nNote that we are trying to avoid being overly prescriptive here with the specific vote type as we want the only limitations on the vote type to be those imposed by Cardano. Further iterations of this standard should discuss the potential for how to implement ranked-choice voting (RCV) inside of this vote object, support multiple-choice vote selection, and more.\nvote\nEssentially, the \"ballot box\" is a smart contract with arbitrary logic decided upon by the authorized vote counter. Some examples include:\nvoter\nBecause the ballot creation and vote casting process has already occurred on-chain we want to provide the maximum flexibility in the protocol here so that each project can decide what is best for their own community. Helios code for the simple case enumerated as #1 above would be:\nconst EXPECTED_SIGNER: PubKeyHash = PubKeyHash::new(#0123456789abcdef) func main(ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool { ctx.tx.is_signed_by(EXPECTED_SIGNER) }\nconst EXPECTED_SIGNER: PubKeyHash = PubKeyHash::new(#0123456789abcdef) func main(ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool { ctx.tx.is_signed_by(EXPECTED_SIGNER) }\nGiven the flexible nature of the \"ballot box\" smart contract enumerated above, we propose a simple algorithm for counting votes and returning the ballots to the user:\nvote\nJavascript-like pseudocode using the Lucid library for the above algorithm would be as follows:\nfunction countVotes(ballotPolicyId, ballotBox) { var votesByAsset = {}; const votes = await lucid.utxosAt(ballotBox); for (const vote of votes) { const voteResult = Data.toJson(Data.from(vote.datum)); for (const unit in vote.assets) { if (!unit.startsWith(ballotPolicyId)) { continue; } const voteCount = Number(vote.assets[unit]); // Should always be 1 votesByAsset[unit] = { voter: voteResult.voter, vote: voteResult.vote, count: voteCount } } } return votesByAsset; }\nfunction countVotes(ballotPolicyId, ballotBox) { var votesByAsset = {}; const votes = await lucid.utxosAt(ballotBox); for (const vote of votes) { const voteResult = Data.toJson(Data.from(vote.datum)); for (const unit in vote.assets) { if (!unit.startsWith(ballotPolicyId)) { continue; } const voteCount = Number(vote.assets[unit]); // Should always be 1 votesByAsset[unit] = { voter: voteResult.voter, vote: voteResult.vote, count: voteCount } } } return votesByAsset; }\nThere is no requirement that the \"ballot counter\" redeem all \"ballots\" from the \"ballot box\" and send them back to the respective voters, but we anticipate that this is what will happen in practice. We encourage further open-sourced code versions that enforce this requirement at the smart contract level.\nEven if the ballot NFT is returned to the user, this will leave users with ada locked alongside these newly created assets, which can impose a financial hardship for certain project users.\nWe can add burn-specific code to our Plutus minting policy so that ballot creation does not impose a major financial burden on users:\nfunc main(redeemer: Redeemer, ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool { tx: Tx = ctx.tx; minted_policy: MintingPolicyHash = ctx.get_current_minting_policy_hash(); redeemer.switch { // Minting code elided for space... Burn => { tx.minted.get_policy(minted_policy).all((asset_id: ByteArray, amount: Int) -> Bool { if (amount > 0) { print(asset_id.show() + \" asset ID was minted not burned (quantity \" + amount.show() + \")\"); false } else { true } }) } } }\nfunc main(redeemer: Redeemer, ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool { tx: Tx = ctx.tx; minted_policy: MintingPolicyHash = ctx.get_current_minting_policy_hash(); redeemer.switch { // Minting code elided for space... Burn => { tx.minted.get_policy(minted_policy).all((asset_id: ByteArray, amount: Int) -> Bool { if (amount > 0) { print(asset_id.show() + \" asset ID was minted not burned (quantity \" + amount.show() + \")\"); false } else { true } }) } } }\nThe Helios code above simply checks that during a burn (as indicated by the Plutus minting policy's redeemer), the user is not attempting to mint a positive number of any assets. With this code, any Cardano wallet can burn any ballot minted as part of this protocol. Why so permissive? We want to ensure that each vote is bringing the minimal costs possible to the user. In providing this native burning mechanism we can free up the minUTxO that had been locked with the ballot, and enable the user to potentially participate in more votes they might not have otherwise. In addition, users who really do not like the specific commemorative NFTs or projects that choose to skip the \"commemorative\" aspect of ballot creation now have an easy way to dispose of \"junk\" assets.\nredeemer\nThere are several existing open-source protocols (e.g., VoteAire) that use metadata to record votes in Cardano transactions without requiring any additional minting or smart contracts. However, since the vote counting occurs off-chain by validating metadata the vote counter is the ultimate arbiter of what is a \"valid\" vote. In this specification, the validity of the vote is ensured in the Ballot creation process, so that any vote in the ballot box is guaranteed to be valid. We strongly believe that moving the entire process into flexible on-chain logic will improve the transparency of the voting process and meet the needs of the use cases discussed in \"Motivation\" and \"Ballot Box\".\nThere is a question as to whether we should enforce the requirement that votes be burned when they are counted by the vote counter. However, we do not want that to be a standard as many users of NFT communities have expressed an interest in receiving commemorative NFTs (similar to an \"I Voted\" sticker). Instead, we propose that the ballot Plutus minting policy be burn-able by anyone who holds the NFT in their wallet. This way, locked ada can be reclaimed if the user has no further use for the commemorative NFT (see an example of this in the Implementation).\nImagine a user who decides to create ballots for the current vote, but not actually cast the vote by sending it to the ballot box. According to checks #1 and #2 in the Plutus Minting Policy, this would be possible. After the ballot was created, the user could sell the reference NFT and wait until just before the polls close to surreptitiously cast a vote over the wishes of the new project owner. Check #3 in the minting policy during the mint transaction itself prevents this attack.\nA user could wait until their first vote casting transaction completes, then create more ballots and resubmit to the ballot box. The result would be the creation of more assets that count toward the ultimate vote. However, Cardano helps us here by identifying tokens based on the concatenation of policy ID and asset identifier. So long as the mapping function in the Plutus minting policy for ballots is idempotent, each subsequent time the user votes the policy will create an additional fungible token with the same asset identifier. Then, the ballot counter can ignore any prior votes based on each unique asset identifier to avoid duplicate votes (see \"'Ballot Counter' - Authorized Wallet\").\nA user could attempt to create multiple ballots of the same name for a given reference NFT. If the reference NFT is actually a fungible token and not an NFT, then our assumptions will have been broken and this is an unsupported use case. But if our assumption that this is an NFT project are correct, then simply checking that the quantity minted is equal to the quantity spent inside of the Plutus minting policy will prevent this. The example code attached does just that.\nDuring the construction of the ballot NFTs we allow the user to specify their vote alongside a voter field indicating where their \"ballot\" NFT should be returned to once the vote is fully counted. Unfortunately, this is not strictly checked inside the Plutus minting policy's code (largely due to CPU/memory constraints). So, we rely on the user to provide an accurate return address, which means that there is the potential for someone who has not actually voted to receive a commemorative NFT. This does not impact the protocol though, as the \"ballot\" NFT was legally minted, just returned to the incorrect location. That user actually received a gift, as they can now burn the ballot and receive some small amount of dust.\nvoter\nThere are several potential disadvantages to this proposal that may be avoided by the use of a native token or other voting mechanism. We enumerate some here explicitly so projects can understand where this protocol may or may not be appropriate to use:\nIn no particular order, we recommend the following implementation details that do not impact the protocol, but may impact user experience:\nDue to the nature of Plutus minting policies and smart contracts, which derive policy identifiers and payment addresses from the actual source code, once a vote has been started it cannot change versions or code implementations. However, because the mechanism we propose here is just a reference architecture, between votes projects are free to change either the \"ballot\" Plutus minting policy or the \"ballot box\" smart contract as they see fit. There are no prior CIPs with which to conform with for backward interoperability.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

A dApp developer needs to \"register\" their dApp by providing a set of claims about their dApp(s) that can be verified by the user. This CIP describes a standardised method for dApp developers to register their dApp(s) on-chain and for users to verify the claims made by dApp developers.\nThis proposal aims to standardise the process of dApp registration and verification, and to provide a set of claims that dApp developers can use to register their dApp(s).\ndApps can express a plethora of information. Some of this information could be claims about who the developer is, what the dApp's associated metadata is, and more. This data lacks standardisation, persistence, and immutability. Data without these features, means that dApp users cannot verify if the dApp's expressed information is consistent across time. The goal of this CIP is to formalise how dApps register their information with a new transaction metadata format that can record the dApp's metadata, ownership, and potentially developer's identity. This formalisation means dApp users can verify if the data expressed by a dApp is consistent with what was registered on-chain.\nAlso, having this formalisation facilitates any actor in the ecosystem to index and query this data, and provide a better user experience when it comes to dApp discovery and usage.\nDevelopers and publishers of dApps can register their dApps by submitting a transaction on-chain that can be indexed and verified by stores, auditors and other ecosystem actors.\nStores and auditors should be able to follow the chain and find when a new dApp registration is anchored on-chain.

For example, some stores might require a field for logo, or screenshots links. The store's should adviertise what fields they require in their documentation so that developers are aware and they can include them in the metadata.\nThere are multiple options to store metadata offchain. The most common options are:\nWe quickly reached a conclusion that it is better to separate them and keep scope of CIP smaller. During discussions it became clear that while there is some overlap of certifications / audits with dApp registration, this overlap is small and can be even removed. At one point we wanted to couple certifications CIP to this CIP (e.g. via some link or dApp version) but we analyzed how dApp developers are currently following the process and we noticed that in many cases certification / audit comes before an official dApp release on main-net. Having established it, we removed this link and not only that dApp registration and certifications are different CIPs but they are very loosely coupled. Loose coupling has also disadvantages as it leads to a situation that in order to attest that a dApp is certified / audited, implementators will have to scan for all script hashes belonging to a dApp and check whether those have been certified / explicitly mentioned in the audit.\nThis one is rather obvious but for the sake of completeness worth documenting. We analyzed how much we should put on-chain vs off-chain and we quickly reached the conclusion that it is better to keep small amount of data on-chain and larger chunk off-chain for which is what exactly CIP-26 is meant for.\nWe believe that CIP-26 is geared towards storing this type of off-chain metadata format but we don't want by any means to stipulate / police this form of storage. In fact it is possible to use offchain metadata storage alternatives such as CIP-26 compatible server / direct http(s) hosting / IPFS, etc.\nWe went back and forth whether we should actually store link (links) to off-chain metadata, eventually we settled on a solution that this is required because there could be a situation that a dApp registration may have off-chain metadata stored somewhere but some stores have it, others don't have it. Now it is required that a dApp developer points to at least one store that has off-chain metadata (as a reference metadata).\nRelease Name is a field, which dApp developers can use on top of Release Version, it has been debated whether field should be mandatory or optional but eventually it has been agreed that we do not want to enforce this field, Release Name is an optional field, Release Version, however, needs to follow semver and is a mandatory field.\nAt the begining neither on-chain, nor off-chain JSON has been following RFC 8785 (canonical JSON) but we reached a point that, due to consistency checks, we need to take hash of both on-chain and off-chain and this forced us to stipulate that both on-chain and off-chain metadata documents need to be converted according to RFC 8785 before taking a blake2b-256 hash of them.\nAs any transaction in cardano network has a signature, which has a role to verify that a certain dApp owner made changes.\nSmart contracts are ownerless, it has been debated that there could be multiple claims to the same dApps from different parties.\nThe standard doesn't prevent anyone from making a claim, so it's up to the different operator to their diligence work and make their own choices of whom they trust. The signature should give the most confidence as anyone can collect known public keys from known development companies. Future CIP revisions can include DID's and Verifiable Credentials to tackle this problem in a more elegant way.\nSince DIDs / Verifiable Credetials are not yet widely used in Cardano ecosystem, usage of them in this initial CIP version has been de-scoped.\nCategories is a predefined enum with values defined in the CIP / schema, it is NOT a free text field, rationale for this is that dApp developers will have no idea what ontology / classification to use, which will likely result in many duplicates of the same thing.\nCategories\nIt may have been visible that we have a purpose field, which can be: \"SPEND\" or \"MINT\", those fields directly map to what is allowed by a Cardano Smart Contract. As of the time of writing CIP - PlutusTx does not allow a script to be both of type: \"SPEND\" and \"MINT\", however, there are new languages on Cardano being worked on where they already allow one validator to be both spending UTxOs and minting tokens - all with the same script hash. To be open for the future it has been agreed to turn purpose field into purposes and make it a JSON array.\npurpose\npurpose\npurposes\nOn Cardano, there are parametrised scripts, meaning that before compilation takes place, it is possible to pass certain parameters instead of using Datum. The consequence of this will be that as we pass different parameters, script hash will be changing. This is especially troublesome for things like certifications / audits but also dApp registration. This topic is being debated as part of CIP: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/385, however, it doesn't seem that there has been conclusion how to tackle this problem. For the moment, a new script hash (despite changing only a parameter) requires a re REGISTRATION to the existing dApp with a requirement to add new version(s) in the dApp's off-chain metadata.\nDatum\nThere are cases on Cardano main-net that script hashes are changing every day, most probably due to parameterised scripts. It is responsibility of the developers to issue an REGISTRATION command and provide on-chain and off-chain metadata following the change, for scripts that are changing daily / hourly it is envisaged that this process be automated by a dApp developer.\nREGISTRATION\nIt has been argued that since anybody can make claims to dApps, this CIP instead of using metadata should use tokens. dApp developers would mint token, which would ensure they are the owners of a given dApp. It is a certainly an interesting approach but shortcomings of the current solution can also be lifted by moving to DID based system and benefit of metadata is that it is easily queriable off chain and currently stores can attest / validate multiple claims for the same dApp. Forcing dApp developers to MINT tokens would complicate this CIP and potentially hinder it's adoption.\nIt has been suggested that we do not use metadata but rather Datums. Metadata cannot enforce format and Datums could. It has been rejected as using Datums requires a smart contract and we want to keep this solution as accessible as possible. It is a GUI concern since if there is a some app that can attest validity and conformance to JSON schema - dApp Registration / Update MUST never be done that does not conform to the schema.\nWe made a decision to change the schema so that scripts and releases are no longer required. This could help to get initial registration from dApp developers faster and some stores simply do not require dApps to add their scripts in order to be listed.\nWe briefly discussed tags and we will likely introduce tags in the future. An array of tags to help stores / dApp developers categories where their dApp should show. This will complement categories field.\ncategories\nWe added DE_REGISTER in additon to already existing REGISTER. The idea is that once dApp devs want to deprecate dApp they can now issue DE_REGISTER request.\nREGISTER\nType field can be PLUTUS or NATIVE, we made it optional and there are already two dApps at least on Cardano at the time of writing, which are only using NATIVE scripts. This optional field helps to differentiante between NATIVE script based and NON_NATIVE dApps.\nType\nPLUTUS\nNATIVE\nWe discussed scenario what to do in case a dApp team wants to deprecate a particular version. Upon a few iteration we settled on doing this in off-chain section.\nIt is not uncommon to see a dApp release a version and then release a fix in the new version and flag the previous version as having security vulnerability. We are intoducing an optional field in the offchain json on the release level: `securityVulnerability\": true.\nWe are introducing a field in the on-chain JSON only, which allows dApp development teams to provide a free text field comment about changes they are making in a given (re-)registration request.\nWe will evaluate for a few months if we have not missed any details, collect feedback from dApp developers, stores. We reserve right to make small changes in this time, while the proposal is in the PROPOSED status / state. Once Acceptance Criteria are met and all comments / feedback from dApp developers is addressed, we will update the proposal to be in ACTIVE state.\nPROPOSED\nAcceptance Criteria\nACTIVE\nCC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "A minPoolCost of 340 ADA/epoch makes popularity the basis for pool desirability, causing preferred traits like pledge and performance to be overshadowed. This has promoted stake to centralize with operators who are effective at campaigning, but do not necessarily have any stake in the system of their own. We want to create a fair marketplace for stake pools that allows the network to decentralize with time; minPoolCost is averse to that goal.\nPopularity is currently the basis for desirability and defines which pools will receive high rewards and which won't. A pool with high popularity, low pledge, and low performance will offer significantly higher rewards than a pool with low popularity, high pledge, and high performance. With equal fee structures, a pool with 19.5MM pledge that is just starting out will be less desirable than a saturated pool with no pledge; a pool with 6MM pledge and perfect performance will be less desirable than a pool with 0 pledge and 90 performance. This makes it apparent we are not incentivizing a secure stable network and the network cannot self-correct if stake ends up in the wrong place.\nThe entirety of IOG's research is without a minPoolCost or any other minimum fee. The game theory design relied on stake pool operators (SPOs) having the ability to compete in a fair marketplace of pool desirability by modifying their pledge, cost, and margin in relation to other pools. Adding a minimum value to cost has removed the opportunity for operators to control their desirability outside of first gaining popularity. As a pool gains popularity it disproportionately gains desirability, allowing the operator to lower pledge and raise margin, while still maintaining higher desirability than a less popular pool with better fee structure and higher pledge. Operators can lie about their costs while still gaining utility. As long as the operator can maintain popularity they can exceed K indefinitely by opening more and more pools with a reward bonus instead of penalty. This significantly lowers the cost of a sybille attack, while making sybille behavior highly desirable and profitable. A sybille attacker, or anybody for that matter, should need stake in the system to compete for delegation, not just a rigorous marketing campaign.\nThe network is incentivizing the wrong behavior from SPOs which has made the network highly leveraged.\n\"The higher the leverage of the system, the worse its security [...] The lower the leverage of a blockchain system, the higher its degree of decentralization.\"\nHigh security should always be the priority.\nStake pool desirability will become a function of pledge, performance, cost, and margin instead of only popularity. Operators will need to consolidate and grow pledge while moderating fees to remain competitive with other pools on the market.\nSPOs define their cost as an absolute value when submitting their registration.cert. They do not reference minPoolCost. Changing minPoolCost will not change any predefined costs. Pools that wish to leave their cost as-is can do so without any input. Pools that wish to lower their cost below 340 ADA/epoch will have to submit an updated registration.cert.\n\"minPoolCost\": 0\n98 of all pools have their cost at 340 ADA/epoch or within + 10. As the price of ADA went from 0.3to0.3 to 0.3to3, almost no operators modified their cost. As the price of ADA dropped from 3to3 to 3to0.3, almost no operators modified their cost. This shows that the minPoolCost is not related to the real cost of operating a pool and the cost of a pool is no longer related to its utility.\nWe have a large body of research accompanied by simulations showing that removing minPoolCost will increase decentralization of the network and begin incentivizing the right behavior from SPOs and the delegating community.\nA minPoolCost is not in Cardano's design specification.

    "completion": "The current reward sharing scheme of Cardano is unfair and anticompetitive. As a result, Cardano has become more centralized over time. The high minimum fixed fee and current pledge benefit favor large stakepools and leave small stakepools at a significant disadvantage. The current scheme allows large pools with low pledge to be more attractive than smaller pools with higher pledge leading to centralization and potential Goldfinger attacks. Furthermore, k, the parameter representing the optimal number of stakepools, is set too low resulting in an ineffective pledge benefit, the formation of multipools, and a low incentive for stakepools to increase pledge over time. Finally, the current setting of a0, the pledge influence parameter, gives an unnecessarily large boost in rewards to fully pledged private pools resulting in significantly less rewards for public pools and their delegators.\nThis proposal retains most of the original reward sharing scheme, but makes changes to ensure fairness, increase decentralization, and reduce the viability of Goldfinger attacks. By removing the minimum fixed fee, adjusting the pledge benefit, increasing k, and reducing a0, a more egalitarian network can be achieved.\nMinimum Fixed Fee\nMargin\nPublic Stakepool\nPrivate Stakepool\nStakepool Operator (SPO)\nMultipool\nROS\nLeverage\nStakepool Viability Point\nStakepool Competitive Point\nStakepool Saturation Point\nUnsaturated Pledge Benefit Penalty\nMinimum Attack Vector (MAV)\nGoldfinger Attack\nSybil Attack\nIn section 10.8 Rewards Distribution Calculation of A Formal Specification of the Cardano Ledger (git revision 1.1-486-g301fede) the current rewards calculation equation is described by the function maxPoolmaxPoolmaxPool:\nmaxPool=R1+a0 (o+p a0 o pz0 oz0z0)maxPool = \\frac{R}{1 + a0} \\cdot (o + p \\cdot a0 \\cdot \\frac{o - p \\frac{z0 - o}{z0}}{z0})maxPool=1+a0R (o+p a0 z0o pz0z0 o )\nwhere: maxPoolmaxPoolmaxPool = maximum rewards for a stake pool, R=((reserve rho)+fees) (1 tau),o=min(poolstake/totalstake,z0)=z0R = ((reserve \\cdot rho) + fees) \\cdot (1 - tau), o = min(poolstake / totalstake, z0) = z0R=((reserve rho)+fees) (1 tau),o=min(poolstake/totalstake,z0)=z0 for fully saturated pool, p=min(pledge/totalstake,z0)p = min(pledge / totalstake, z0)p=min(pledge/totalstake,z0), and z0=1/kz0 = 1 / kz0=1/k\nCurrent protocol parameters: k=500,rho=0.003,a0=0.3k = 500, rho = 0.003, a0 = 0.3k=500,rho=0.003,a0=0.3, and tau=0.2tau = 0.2tau=0.2\nThe current reward sharing scheme which includes the rewards calculation equation and the minimum fixed fee are inadequate in promoting decentralization as evident by Cardano s currently low MAV relative to k. This is due to its anticompetitive features which are discussed in this section.\nThe minimum fixed fee or minPoolCost was apparently included for additional sybil attack protection. However, it s effect has been the opposite allowing stakepools with low pledge to offer greater rewards than pools with higher pledge in some cases. Moreover, the minimum fixed fee is certainly problematic as it places an unfair burden on small pools by enforcing a disproportionally larger fee than that of larger stakepools, reducing the ROS of small pools and incentivizing delegation to larger stakepools. This leads to centralization of the network around established stakepools, leaving less opportunity for smaller stakepools that may have greater pledge or community presence.\nThe current pledge benefit in the rewards equation is a function of the total stake in a pool that is significantly biased towards large stakepools that are close to saturation. Specifically, the current equation penalizes the pledge benefit of small pools. The smaller the pool, the larger the penalty. This unsaturated pledge benefit penalty combined with the minimum fixed fee leads to illogical rewards where large pools with low pledges can offer delegators higher ROS than smaller pools with significantly higher pledges. As a result, delegators are incentivized to delegate to larger stakepools even if they have lower pledges leading to network centralization.\nThe unsaturated pledge benefit penalty is part of the current rewards calculation equation and can be described by the equation:\nUnsaturatedPledgeBenefitPenalty=R1+a0 p a0 pz0 oz0z0Unsaturated Pledge Benefit Penalty = \\frac{R}{1 + a0} \\cdot p \\cdot a0 \\cdot \\frac{p \\frac{z0 - o}{z0}}{z0}UnsaturatedPledgeBenefitPenalty=1+a0R p a0 z0pz0z0 o\nSee UnsaturatedPledgeBenefitPenalty.xlxs to calculate the current unsaturated pledge benefit penalty for a stakepool.\nThe minimum fixed fee and current pledge benefit introduce a potential security threat to the Cardano protocol: Goldfinger attacks. The current reward scheme puts all small stakepools at a disadvantage regardless of pledge centralizing the network around established stakepools rather than pools with the most attractive pledge and fee combination. When SPOs with low stake (pledge) in the protocol are allowed to dominate consensus, they have a potential alternative incentive to attack the network in order make profit by shorting ADA. Because these stakepools have low stake in the protocol (operate with low or even zero pledge), they would be able make profit without any significant loss other than future staking rewards. With leverage, the attackers could make significantly more profit shorting ADA than years of staking.\nThe current setting of k, the parameter representing the optimal number of stakepools, is set too low to provide an effective pledge benefit leaving little incentive for pools to increase pledge over time. Specifically, with a small k value, a fully pledged pledge benefit is far from achievable for most SPOs. An ineffective pledge benefit leads to the formation of multipools with high leverage, as operators can split their pledge into multiple stakepools without a significant decrease in ROS in the resulting stakepools.\nThe current setting of a0, the pledge influence parameter, gives an unnecessarily large boost in rewards to very high pledge and fully pledged private pools. Specifically, the current setting of a0 results in approximately 30 greater rewards for fully pledged private pools. This boost in rewards unfortunately results significantly less rewards for public pools that commonly have low pledges relative to the saturation point. Given that most Cardano users are delegators and not SPOs, this exclusive boost for high pledge pools decreases Cardano s overall attractiveness as a staking protocol. Additionally, having a high a0 setting only accelerates the wealth (ADA) disparity between large entities operating private pools and delegators who make up majority of the ecosystem.\nThe proposed rewards calculation equation is a modification of the current equation that removes the unsaturated pledge benefit penalty:\nmaxPool=R1+a0 (o+p a0 oz0)maxPool = \\frac{R}{1 + a0} \\cdot (o + p \\cdot a0 \\cdot \\frac{o}{z0})maxPool=1+a0R (o+p a0 z0o )\nwhere: maxPoolmaxPoolmaxPool = maximum rewards for a stake pool, R=((reserve rho)+fees) (1 tau),o=min(poolstake/totalstake,z0)=z0R = ((reserve \\cdot rho) + fees) \\cdot (1 - tau), o = min(poolstake / totalstake, z0) = z0R=((reserve rho)+fees) (1 tau),o=min(poolstake/totalstake,z0)=z0 for fully saturated pool, p=min(pledge/totalstake,z0)p = min(pledge / totalstake, z0)p=min(pledge/totalstake,z0), and z0=1/kz0 = 1 / kz0=1/k\nThe proposed parameter values are the following:\nThe main goal of this proposal is to ensure fairness in stakepool rewards. This is achieved by including these principles in the design:\nThe current reward sharing scheme includes two notable anticompetitive features. These features are the minimum fixed fee and the unsaturated pledge benefit penalty. This proposal removes these features to ensure fairness and promote adequate competition between stakepools. Removing these anticompetitive features promotes delegation to pools with most attractive pledge and fee combinations rather than established large pools and multipools. This results in fairer competition among stakepools and lower possibility of Goldfinger attacks as the pledge benefit is effective at all stakepool sizes. Greater decentralization is also possible as small stakepools will be able to offer competitive returns and potentially extract delegation from low pledge multipools.\nTo ensure a more effective pledge benefit and incentivize increasing pledge over time, this proposal increases the current value of k from 500 to 1000. This allows a fully pledged pledge benefit to be closer for all SPOs and will force multipools to split pledge and reduce pledge benefit if they wish to continue operating with the same leverage. Additionally, a change in the value of k will give many stagnant delegators an incentive to reconsider their delegations giving smaller stakepools an opportunity at increasing delegation.\nFinally, to reduce the large rewards disparity between private pools and delegators, this proposal reduces the setting of a0 from 0.3 to 0.2. The current setting of a0 results in approximately 30 greater rewards for fully pledged private pools. This proposal reduces this disparity to 20 to create a fairer rewards distribution. The result is an overall increase in rewards for delegators as most public pools operate with low pledges relative to the saturation point. Given that delegators make up majority of users, this reduction in a0 will make Cardano a much more competitive staking investment in contrast to other blockchains.\nThese proposed changes to Cardano s reward sharing scheme are aimed at ensuring fairness, increasing decentralization, and creating a more egalitarian staking ecosystem.\nStakepool viability and competitive points can give some insight into the fairness of the reward scheme. These points are essentially start-up costs required to run viable and competitive stakepools. These points are very high and out of reach for many SPOs with the current scheme. This proposal effectively minimizes these points.\nCurrent stakepool viability point: ~625,000 ADA\nCurrent stakepool competitive point: ~19,000,000 ADA\nProposal stakepool viability point: 1 ADA\nProposal stakepool competitive point: 1 ADA\nSee FairStakepoolRewards.xlxs to compare stakepool ROS between the current and proposed scheme.\nThis proposal includes parameter changes, one parameter removal, and a change to the rewards calculation. Because of the parameter removal and changes to the rewards calculation, a hardfork will be necessary for implementation.\nEach stage will be an individual protocol update. The first two updates will be protocol parameter updates. The third and final update will require a hardfork.\nBefore implementation, engineering and research teams must review the feasibility and potential consequences of the proposal, create the implementation for each update, and decide on the time interval between updates.\nImplementation can be staged to reduce shock to the network:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This CIP specifies a policy for the backwards compatibility of the serialization scheme of Cardano transactions.\nTransactions on Cardano are sent on the wire using CBOR and are specified with CDDL. The first scheme was introduced with the Byron phase. This scheme was changed dramatically with the introduction of the Shelley phase. As of the time of the writing of this CIP, however, every new scheme has been backwards compatible with the original scheme from the Shelley phase. The intention is still to maintain backwards compatibility to the extent reasonable, and to make explicit our policy for breaking backwards compatibility when deemed necessary.\nProblems with serialization fall into two categories:\nNote that at the time of the writing of this CIP, there is only one implementation of the Cardano node, and we do not yet need to consider inconsistencies between different implementations.\nThe policy for maintaining backwards compatibility with the transaction serialization will be as follows.\nA serious flaw in the serialization is an issue which could have a large and negative impact on the network, and which requires a hard fork to fix. These will almost always be problems with the serialization and not the specification. It is up to human discretion to determine what constitutes a serious flaw, mostly likely by the core developers.\nBackwards compatibility can be abandoned in the case of a serious flaw, and the fix will occur at the next available hard fork.\nA non-serious flaw in the serialization is an issue which is not safety critical, but is problematic enough to merit breaking backwards compatibility. This is again a human judgment.\nBackwards compatibility can be abandoned in the case of a non-serious flaw, but there must be a deprecation cycle:\nA good example of a non-serious flaw is the CDDL specification of the transaction output in the Alonzo ledger era:\nalonzo_transaction_output = [ address, amount : value, ? datum_hash : $hash32 ]\nalonzo_transaction_output = [ address, amount : value, ? datum_hash : $hash32 ]\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with this scheme, but it caused a problem in the Babbage ledger era with the addition of inline datums and script references. In particular, there were two new optional fields, and there was mutual exclusivity. In order to maintain backwards compatibility, Babbage introduced this scheme:\ntransaction_output = alonzo_transaction_output / babbage_transaction_output babbage_transaction_output = { 0 : address , 1 : value , ? 2 : [ 0, $hash32 // 1, data ] , ? 3 : script_ref }\ntransaction_output = alonzo_transaction_output / babbage_transaction_output babbage_transaction_output = { 0 : address , 1 : value , ? 2 : [ 0, $hash32 // 1, data ] , ? 3 : script_ref }\nIn other words, a new format was created, but the legacy format was still supported. The new format, babbage_transaction_output, was introduced 2022-09-22 with the Vasil hard fork, The old format, alonzo_transaction_output, can be retired after 2023-03-22.\nbabbage_transaction_output\nalonzo_transaction_output\nNote that this example required a hard fork.\nA good example of a non-serious flaw requiring a soft fork is the removal of zero-valued multi-assets in the mint field of the transaction body.\nIn the Babbage ledger era, a multi-asset value was defined as:\nvalue = coin / [coin,multiasset<uint>]\nvalue = coin / [coin,multiasset<uint>]\nZero values can be confusing inside of things like explorers, so in the Conway era they are removed:\nnatNum = 1 .. 4294967295 value = coin / [coin,multiasset<natNum>]\nnatNum = 1 .. 4294967295 value = coin / [coin,multiasset<natNum>]\nNotice that block validators will not notice this change, though block producers will notice it.\nIt seems clear that security issues merit breaking backwards compatibility and should be fixed as soon as possible. The six month compatibility window for non-serious flaws is mostly arbitrary, but we need to allow enough time for people to migrate. It would be great to have more explicit definitions for \"serious\" and \"non-serious\" flaws, but this seems very difficult.\nN/A\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "The current parameter settings of Cardano's rewards sharing scheme leave much to be desired in terms of fairness and promoting decentralization. minPoolCost puts small stakepools at a significant disadvantage. Replacing minPoolCost with a minPoolRate will ensure a level playing field for stakepools while providing sufficient sybil attack resistance. Additionally, the current setting of k, the optimal number of stakepools, is too low to provide an adequate pledge benefit. Increasing k will make the pledge benefit more effective and get delegations moving in hopes of helping single pool operators gain delegations.\nThe parameter changes in this proposal are an optimization of the current settings and are meant to improve the fairness and decentralization of Cardano. Furthermore, all changes suggested in this proposal have been specifically voiced by the Cardano community.\nStakepool Operator (SPO)\nMultipool\nROS\nStakepool Viability Point\nStakepool Competitive Point\nStakepool Saturation Point\nMinimum Attack Vector (MAV)\nSybil Attack\nCardano s declining MAV is a real problem as the network matures and gains more users. Ideally MAV should increase or stay consistent over time. However, this is currently not the case. This trend points to potential problems with the parameters set in the rewards sharing scheme. Now that staking on the network has matured, it is time to re-examine the rewards sharing scheme parameters and seek optimization. This proposal suggests changes that aim to increase the fairness and decentralization of the Cardano network.\nminPoolCost sets a minimum fixed fee that a stakepool must collect from an epoch s rewards before distributing to delegators. This parameter was added to the rewards sharing scheme to provide additional sybil attack protection. While this parameter has been successful at deterring sybil attacks on the Cardano network, it has been at the expense of fairness and decentralization. minPoolCost imposes a proportionally greater staking fee on small stakepools in contrast to larger pools. This discrepancy results in many small pools being unviable and the network centralizing around established pools. It is not uncommon for small stakepools with higher pledge to offer inferior rewards to that of large stakepools with much lower pledge. In this way, minPoolCost reduces the effectiveness of pledge in the rewards scheme. In order to create a level playing field for stakepools and increase the effectiveness of pledge, minPoolCost must be removed from the protocol.\nThe current pledge benefit favors established pools close to saturation as a means of sybil attack protection. Specifically, this property combats high pledge sybil pools (~1 mil ADA pledge) that could be set up by large entities such as centralized exchanges. In contrast to minPoolCost, the pledge benefit s built-in sybil attack protection is significantly less aggressive and does not affect the viability of stakepools. In this way, it is a useful mechanism to combat sybil pools. However, the pledge benefit on its own has no means to combat zero fee sybil pools. Without minPoolCost, zero fee sybil pools could offer greater rewards than that of established stakepools that must set fees to pay for continued operation. In order to combat zero fee sybil pools without minPoolCost, minPoolRate must be added to the protocol. minPoolRate will set a minimum margin or percentage fee that operators can extract from an epoch s staking rewards. This new parameter will protect established stakepools by ensuring that they collect sufficient revenue from operation while offering a competitive ROS. Additionally, minPoolRate can be updated to reflect current economic conditions. As minPoolRate enforces a proportional minimum fee, it does not affect the viability of stakepools. Unlike minPoolCost, minPoolRate will be able to provide sufficient sybil attack protection with the pledge benefit while maintaining a level playing field for stakepools. minPoolRate was originally proposed in CIP-0023.\nk represents the optimal number of stakepools that the Cardano network can support. This is achieved through a saturation mechanism where after exceeding a saturation point a stakepool will earn no additional rewards. A stakepool larger than the saturation point will offer lower rewards than a stakepool at the saturation point. The parameter k is used to tune the saturation point. In addition to tuning the saturation point, k also affects the pledge benefit. The maximum pledge benefit exists when a pool is fully saturated. Therefore, increasing k will increase the number of optimal stakepools, decrease the saturation point, and make it easier for stakepools to achieve the maximum pledge benefit. Increasing the effect of the pledge benefit on rewards is imperative, as pledge currently has little effect on rewards allowing low pledge pools to proliferate through marketing alone. Furthermore, increasing k can be used to get stale delegations moving. This is especially useful in the case of saturated multipools, where delegators would have to reconsider their delegation potentially assisting small and medium sized pools. Any delegation flow from multipools to single pool operators will increase the decentralization of Cardano.\nThis CIP proposes several parameter changes. In order to give SPOs and delegators enough time to react to the changes, this CIP is divided into 4 stages. The proposed time interval between stages is 3 epochs or 15 days. However, it is up to the implementors to determine the best time interval between stages. Parameters are changed in the following stages:\nIn order to ensure the compatibility of existing stakepool registration certificates with this CIP, the variable poolRateEff must be added to the protocol. This variable will be the effective margin used during stakepool fee calculation. Following the hardfork, poolRate will only be the value set by SPOs. poolRate will be superseded by minPoolRate if its value is lower than minPoolRate. This is demonstrated in the definition of poolRateEff:\npoolRateEff=max(poolRate,minPoolRate)poolRateEff = max(poolRate, minPoolRate)poolRateEff=max(poolRate,minPoolRate)\nStage 1 reduces minPoolCost from 340 ADA to 170 ADA. 170 ADA is proposed because it is half of the current minPoolCost and is close to what the USD value of minPoolCost was during the launch of Shelley. This value is more than sufficient to allow established community pools to stay profitable while enabling smaller pools to be more competitive. This value also maintains sybil attack resistance.\nStage 2 introduces the largest change to the network by deleting minPoolCost from the protocol in favor of a minPoolRate of 3 . 3 is proposed, as it allows established community pools to stay profitable when competing against minimum fee pools. This in combination with the pledge benefit provide sufficient sybil attack resistance while leveling the playing field for all stakepools. As pool size is significantly less important following this stage, pledge becomes a more important factor in choice of delegation. In contrast, Lido, Ethereum s most popular liquid staking DApp, applies a 10 fee on participants' staking rewards.\nStage 3 increases k from 500 to 750. The purpose of stage 3 and stage 4 is two-fold. Firstly, increasing k increases the pledge benefit. The more effective the pledge benefit, the greater Cardano s sybil attack resistance. Secondly, increasing k may get stale delegations moving again by oversaturating large pools. This will cause many delegators to reconsider their delegation, potentially helping smaller community pools find delegations. Increasing k is split into two stages to give SPOs sufficient time to react to the change. Furthermore, it is imperative that k is increased after stage 2, as small stakepools will only be competitive after minPoolCost has been removed.\nStage 4 increases k from 750 to 1000. Stage 4 will further improve the pledge benefit and get more delegations moving. This is the final stage of this proposal.\nBelow are test cases for the current rewards scheme and each stage of this proposal. The calculated values assume all pools are operating with minimum fees. Sybil pools are assumed to be small pools with no delegations. Community pools are assumed to be pools with significant delegation. As demonstrated below, this proposal allows community pools to have sufficient revenue (higher than the USD value of minPoolCost at the launch of Shelley) while creating a level playing field for all stakepools. Sybil attack resistance is maintained at every stage, as community pool ROS remains higher than sybil pool ROS. Data used for calculations was approximated from epoch 385. See ImprovedRewardsSchemeParameters.xlxs for more test cases.\nStakepool Viability Point: ~670,000 ADA\nStakepool Competitive Point: ~20,000,000 ADA\nStakepool Viability Point: ~335,000 ADA\nStakepool Competitive Point: ~16,500,000 ADA\nStakepool Viability Point: 1 ADA\nStakepool Competitive Point: 1 ADA\nStakepool Viability Point: 1 ADA\nStakepool Competitive Point: 1 ADA\nStakepool Viability Point: 1 ADA\nStakepool Competitive Point: 1 ADA\nThis proposal includes several parameter changes and changes to ledger rules. Specifically, stage 2 of this proposal will require a hardfork to introduce a new parameter, delete a parameter, and modify the stakepool fee calculation equation. As mentioned in the specification section, the stakepool fee calculation equation must be modified in order to ensure current stakepool registration certificates are compatible with this CIP.\nEach stage will be an individual update. Stages 1, 3, and 4 will be parameter updates. Stage 2 will require a hardfork.\nBefore implementation, engineering and research teams must review the feasibility and potential consequences of the proposal, create the implementation for each update, and decide on the time interval between updates.\nAs previously mentioned, implementation will occur in the following stages:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0083?",
    "completion": "This CIP is an addendum to the original CIP-0020, which is active since mid 2021 and widely used across many entities. It describes the JSON schema to add encrypted messages/comments/memos as transaction metadata. It is fully backwards compatible and requires no changes in existing tools, explorers, wallets. Tools/Wallets that do not have an implementation to decrypt this format will just show the encrypted base64 as the message, but it will not break any existing processes.\nTransaction messages/comments/memos via CIP-0020 are widely used across the Cardano Blockchain. For example DEXs are using it to comment there payouts to the customers. Individual users are using it to send funds across the network to other users with attached information about it. Users are buying goods and pay directly in ADA, attaching payment informations via an added message.\nTheses and many other usecases are actively happening on the blockchain right now and are a valuable addition to the core functions.\nMetadata is attached as a CBOR bytearray in the auxiliary dataset of a transaction. So the encoding is just done from UTF8-Text to Hex-Code/Bytes and after that it is sent in plaintext over the network/blockchain. To seek further adoption of blockchain usage, privacy features are a must in the future. Having cleartext information in a TCP packet might not be an issue for many things, but it is an issue if you wanna convince users to use the blockchain and their transaction feature like users using it now with bank transfers.\nIt is easy for 3rd-party entities like Internet Service Providers, Datacenters or basically any Man-In-The-Middle to collect data that is sent in cleartext. Data such as bank-account-numbers, email-addresses, telephone numbers, etc. which are parts of transaction messages.\nAs pointed out above, everyone that is having access to the datastream and of course the publicly distributed ledger can extract the cleartext data of the transaction messages. Because there must not even be a specific approach to get such transaction message data out of a TCP stream, just a simple filter for email addresses (example) is enough. Even with a simple encryption of such messages - and publicly known passphrase - it is much more complicated for the Man-In-The-Middle listener to collect data on the fly.\nTargeted benefits:\nThis addition to the original CIP-0020 should not be seen as the end-all-be-all security solution for privacy on the blockchain. There's better options and upcoming Midnight for that. The transaction messages are also not intended to act like chat messages on the chain.\nThe specification update for encrypted messages takes advantage of the simple original design, which is leaving room for additional json-keys not affecting the parsing of the content at all. The only outcome if a receiver does not process the encrypted content is, that the encrypted message is shown instead of an maybe autodecrypted one. But even the encrypted base64 strings fit into the max. 64char long string restriction. So it does not break any tools. More on the autodecryption later.\n{ \"674\": { \"enc\": \"<encryption-method>\", \"msg\": [ \"base64-string 1\", \"base64-string 2\", \"base64-string 3\" ... ] } }\n{ \"674\": { \"enc\": \"<encryption-method>\", \"msg\": [ \"base64-string 1\", \"base64-string 2\", \"base64-string 3\" ... ] } }\nThe format is identical to the original one, with a simple addition of the enc (encryptionmode) entry.\nenc\nThe value given in the enc field references the type of encryption is used. Starting with a simple implementation named basic. There is room to add additional encryption method in the future like using ChaCha20/Poly1305 or using public/private key encryption. Also there is the possibility to not encode the metadata in the standard JSON format, but using CBOR encoding instead.\nenc\nbasic\nThis is not really an encryption mode, but included as a backwards compatible entry to signal this message as an unencrypted one. The entry is not needed and fully optional for unencrypted messages.\nSalted__\nOpenSSL was choosen, because its fast and widely available also for all kind of different platforms, web frontends, etc. Encryption algo is AES-256-CBC (salted) using pdkdf2 to derive the key from the given passphrase. 10000 Iterations is the default value for this encryption method. The format of the encoded output is base64 format.\npdkdf2\nThe encryption is based on a given passphrase, which can be choosen by the user. However, a default-passphrase \"cardano\" should be used to encrypt/decrypt if no other passphrase is provided or known.\nOpenSSL uses PKCS#7 as padding. The adopted cipher accepts only multiple of 16-byte blocks. Not fitting messages to be encrypted are filled with the number of padding bytes that are needed to form multiple of 16-bytes. So if 1 byte of padding is required, the padding \"01\" is added. If 2 bytes of padding are needed, \"02 02\" is added. If no padding is required, an extra block of 0x10 bytes is added, meaning sixteen \"10\" bytes. In order to be interoperable with OpenSSL this kind of padding is a requirement.\nAs pointed out above, its way harder for man-in-the-middle listeners, to decrypt every single message on the fly. So by using a default passphrase, tools can encrypt messages and explorers/wallets can autodecrypt such messages trying to use the default passphrase. In that way, the displayed message is automatically readable to the user. If a more protected communication is needed, the sender can choose a custom passphrase and communicate that to the receiver as a preshared passphrase.\nWhat part is uses for the encryption?\nThe whole content of the unencrypted normal transaction metadata msg: key is used, thats the array with the message string(s). (Example below)\nmsg:\nYes, example implementations for node.js, PHP, bash, etc. can be found in the codesamples folder.

The original CIP-0020 design allowed the addition of new entries like the \"enc\": key for encrypted messages in this CIP. Therefore the encoding format of the encrypted message was choosen to be UTF-8 instead of bytearrays, because it would break the backwards compatibility to CIP-0020. But maybe more important, it gives the user a simple text-format to handle such messages. Users can copy and paste the base64 encoded string(s) using there own tools for creation and verification. For example, a user can simply copy the encrypted format from an explorer and verify it with an external own local tool. Such messages are usally pretty short. Yes, the benefit of using bytearrays is to have less data (around -33 over base64), but the decision was made to sacrifice this benefit in favor of the base64 format for the reasons pointed out before.\n\"enc\":\nThere is also for example CIP-8, but CIP-8 doesn't really fulfill the simplicity of just providing encrypted messages. CIP-8 is focused on Signing, which is not needed for encryption. The method to generate encrypted messages here is not intended to verify the owner of a message via signing. There is no need that everything on Cardano must be difficult. Also using such CBOR encoded structures would break all currently implemented transaction message solutions. This CIP uses openssl and base64 encoding, and endusers could even copy&paste such text into other tools, etc. Future updates may include the option to mix encrypted and unencrypted messages by adding another key like msgclear to support such a mixed message style format.\nmsgclear\nWallets/Tools can implement an autodecryption attempt with the default passphrase on such messages, to give the user a more streamlined experience. The communication should be done via https or similar to make sure the message cleartext is not exposed again during the transmission. Additionally the Tools can prompt for an input and decrypt the message once the user has requested it, this decryption should be done on the user frontend for further security.\nLike with CIP-0020, it is up to the wallet-/display-/receiver-implementor to parse and check the provided metadata. As for the current state, its not possible to have the same label \"674\" more than once in a cardano transaction. So a check about that can be ignored at the moment. This CIP provides the correct implementation format, the parsing should search for the \"674\" metadata label, the \"msg\" and the \"enc\" key underneath it. There should also be a check, that the provided data within that \"msg\" key is an array. All other implementations like a missing \"msg\" key, or a single string instead of an array, should be marked by the display-implementor as \"invalid\". Additional keys within the \"674\" label should not affect the parsing of the \"msg\" and the \"enc\" key. As written above, we will likely see more entries here in the future like a \"version\" key for example, so additional keys should not harm the parsing of the \"msg\" and \"enc\" key.\nAn encrypted transaction message should be considered valid if the following apply:\nbasic\nIf any of the above is not met, ignore the metadata as an encrypted transaction message. Can still be displayed as general metadata to the transaction.\nThe implementation format in this CIP should be the ground base for encrypted transaction messages/comments/memos and should be respected by creator-/sender-implementations as well as in wallet-/receiver-/display-implementations.\nThe acceptance criteria to be Active should already have been met, because the following Implementors using this CIP on the Cardano Blockchain:\nActive\nCexplorer.io: With the implementation of the encrypted message decoding.\nStakePool Operator Scripts: It works on the commandline like any other script of the collection by just adding the \"enc: basic\" parameter, you can provide an individual passphrase by using the \"pass: passphrase \" parameter.

And of course also to new ones.\nThere are various code samples available in the codesamples folder to make it as easy as possible for integrators to implement it.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

Starting in the Conway ledger era, literate Agda will be used. During the transition from LaTeX\\LaTeXLATE X to literate Agda, we will take advantage of the ability to substitute LaTeX\\LaTeXLATE X in place of Agda code when needed for expedience. With time, the Agda specification will not only be used to provide PDF specifications, but also reference implementations.\nA ledger era is a collection of features added to the ledger which are introduced at a hard fork. The existing ledger eras, with very simplistic descriptions, are given below.\nNote that there is no Allegra specification. The Allegra era consists entirely of the addition of timelocks to the MultiSig script introduced in the Shelley ledger era (See figure 12 of the Mary specification).\nNote that small, isolated changes can be made within a ledger era by way of an intra-era hard fork. See CIP-59 for more details.\nSome provenance about the ledger calculations is provided by ledger events. Sometimes these events have clear triggers (e.g. Plutus script execution) and sometimes they provide intermediate calculations performed by the ledger rules (e.g. the reweard calculation). The events come with zero cost to a running node if not used and are not stored in the ledger state. Documentation about the existing events can be found here.\nSince most ledger CIPs will involve backwards incompatible changes, the following two definitions are helpful:\nHard fork - A hard fork is a change to the protocol (not restricted to the ledger) resulting in a single new block definition becoming valid.\nAlternatively, a hard fork is a backwards incompatible change for both block producers and block validators.\nSoft fork - A soft fork is a change to the protocol (not restricted to the ledger) resulting in fewer blocks being valid.\nAlternatively, a soft fork is a backwards incompatible change for block producers, but a backwards compatible change for block validators.\nTransactions and blocks are serialized with CBOR and specified with CDDL file.\nSerialization changes to the ledger are discussed in CIP-80.\nNote that the serialisation format of the ledger state is unspecified and left as an implementation detail (unlike the format of blocks).\nThe ledger and Plutus scripts have a common interface, described in CIP-35. CIPs relating to this inteface are relevant to both the ledger and to the Plutus CIP categories.\nAdditionally, there is significant overlap with the Ledger category around the ledger-script interface and the protocol parameters. CIPs which change these parts of Cardano should generally use the Plutus category and not the Ledger category, although the Editors may ask the Ledger reviewers to comment.\nThe criterion for deciding if a change to the ledger merits a CIP is as follows: changes to the ledger require going through the CIP process whenever every implementation of the Cardano ledger needs to be standardized on the details.\nBug fixes are an exception to this criterion, they do not merit a CIP except in the case that the fix is substantially complicated. A \"bug fix\" is a change to behavior where:\nSerialization changes are another possible exception to the criterion. Many serialization changes can be handled as a part of the normal development process without the need for a CIP. Dramatic changes to the serialization, however, may benefit from the CIP process.\nThe ledger rules MUST be standardized in order for consensus to be maintained, but things like the ledger events are more open to debate.\nChanges to the protocol parameter values do not require a CIP since they are a governance issue (see CIP-1694).\nThe following table gives the current set of reviewers for Ledger CIPs.\nEven though there is currently only one implementation, this provides us with a clear definition of what is essential to the ledger. It also provides a clear path for future implementations.\nThis decision should be left to the community as more use cases emerge.\nIt is not always clear which seemingly small details can make a large difference to the many consumers of the ledger. It is better that the CIP process achieve consensus on all the details than for these decisions to be made during the implementation phase.\nThis CIP requires the acceptance of the Ledger team, which it has in virtue of its authorship.\nNo implementation is required.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\nSee CIP-1. While nothing new is added to the usual CIP process, expectations for ledger CIPs are made explicit and some background information is provided.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0085?",
    "completion": "Plutus Core does not contain any native support for datatypes. Instead, users who want to use structured data must encode it; a typical approach is to use Scott encoding. This CIP proposes to add native support for datatypes to Plutus Core using sums-of-products (SOPs), and to use that support more efficient scripts, and better code-generation for compilers targeting Plutus Core.\nThe first designs of Plutus Core had native support for datatypes. In the interest of keeping the language as small and simple as possible, this was removed in favour of encoding datatype values using Scott encoding.\nExperiments at the time showed that the performance penalty of using Scott encoding over native datatypes was not too large, and so we could realistically use Scott encoding. But we might expect that we should be able to do better with a native implementation, and indeed we can.\nThis section talks about Haskell, but the same problem applies in other languages.\nGiven a Haskell value, how do you translate it into the equivalent Plutus Core term ('lifting')? It's clear what to do for a Haskell value of one of the Plutus Core builtin types (just turn it into a constant), but it's much more complicated for a Haskell value that is a datatype value: you have to know how to do all the complicated Scott-encoding work.\nFor example:\n1\n(con integer 1)\nJust 1\n(delay (lam case_Nothing (lam case_Just [case_Just (con integer 1)])))\nThis means that it's difficult to specify how to do lifting for structured data. For example, if we want users (or the ledger!) to create Plutus Core terms representing structured data, it will be difficult to explain how to do it.\nThere is also the opposite direction: how can we turn a Plutus Core term back into a Haskell value ('unlifting)'? Again, it's clear how to do this for builtin types and very unclear how to do it for datatypes. Doing anything with a Scott-encoded datatype usually requires applying it to arguments and evaluating it. It's not reasonable to require the Plutus Core evaluator just to work out what a term means.\nFor example:\n(con integer 1)\n1\n(delay (lam case_Nothing (lam case_Just [caseJust (con integer 1)])))\nJust\nIn practice this makes Plutus Core terms very opaque and difficult to work with.\nData\nThe design of the EUTXO model rests on passing arguments to the script for the redeemer, datum, and script context. But we hit upon the problem of how to represent this information.\nThe first design was to encode each argument as a Plutus Core term (using Scott-encoding for structued data), and pass it directly to the script. However, this had several problems:\nThe solution that we chose was to pick a single generic structured data type which would be used for data interchange between the ledger and scripts. This is the Data type.\nData\nHowever, Data is not the natural representation of structured values inside a script, that would be as datatypes. So this means we often want a decoding step where the script translates Data into its own representation.\nData\nData\nThe Plutus Core interpreter has got a lot faster over the last few years (at least one order of magnitude, possibly two by now). However, there continues to be relentless pressure on script resource usage. This will always be the case: no matter how fast we make things, things can always be faster or cheaper and it will improve throughput and save people money.\nThat means that significant performance gains are always compelling.\nAs discussed above, both lifting and unlifting are currently very tricky or impossible.\nThe Data type is used in many places as a representation of structured data:\nData\nData\nData\nHowever, working with Data is not very pleasant. Deconstructing a datatype encoded as Data requires multiple steps, each of which has to go through the builtins machinery, which imposes additional overhead. Our benchmarks show that this is very 3x slower even than Scott encoding datatypes.\nData\nData\nThe following new term constructors are added to the Plutus Core language:1\nt ::= ... -- Packs the fields into a constructor value tagged with i | (constr i t...) -- Inspects the tag on t and passes its fields to the corresponding case branch | (case t t...)\nt ::= ... -- Packs the fields into a constructor value tagged with i | (constr i t...) -- Inspects the tag on t and passes its fields to the corresponding case branch | (case t t...)\nTags start from 0, with 0 being the first case branch, and so on.\nThe small-step reduction rules for these terms are:\nNote that CASE_SUB does not reduce branches and CASE_EVAL preserves only the selected case branch. This means that only the chosen case branch is evaluated, and so case is not strict in the other branches.2\nCASE_SUB\nCASE_EVAL\ncase\nAlso, note that case branches are arbitrary terms, and can be anything which can be applied. That means that, for example, it is legal to use a builtin as a case branch, or an expression which evaluates to a function. However, the most typical case will probably be a literal lambda.\nA new Plutus Core minor language version 1.1.0 is added to indicate support for these terms. They are illegal before that version.\nAll steps in the CEK machine have costs, all of which are constant. There are cost model parameters which set the costs for each step. This will therefore be new cost model paramters governing the costs for the steps for evaluating constr and case.\nconstr\ncase\nThere is a potential problem because constr and case have a variable number of children, unlike all the existing constructs. The risk is that we could end up doing a linear amount of work but only paying a constant cost.\nconstr\ncase\nHowever:\nconstr\ncase\nMost Plutus Core programs spend a significant amount of their time operating on datatypes, so we would expect that a performance improvement here would make a significant difference.\nIndeed, this seems to be true. Our benchmarks show that this CIP leads to:\nNote that the speedup from point 1 is inclusive of the slowdown from point 2.\nToday, lifting is complicated, and unlifting is mostly impossible. With this CIP lifting becomes very simple, and unlifting becomes not only possible but simple. Our prototype implementation contains code-generation to generate lifting and unlifting code in Haskell, but it is straightforward enough that you could easily do it in any language.\nThere are still some limitations, e.g. you cannot lift or unlift structures that contain functions, but this is not that unusual (similarly, you typically can't serialise such structures).\nThe costs of this proposal are substantial.\nPlutus Core today has only 8 kinds of term, this proposal adds 2 more, an increase of 25 . Additionally, the new term types are the first term types which have a variable number of children. Both of these changes increase implementation complexity throughout the system: everything that processes Plutus Core terms must now handle the new cases, and handle the variable numbers of children.\nThis change also modestly expends our novelty budget. Plutus Core is a deliberately conservative language: for the most part it is just the untyped lambda calculus. The proposed new features for sums-of-products are also conservative, and follow a very typical pattern. But they are not quite as standard as the untyped lambda calculus.\nMoreover, a change like this would be very painful to reverse, so we should seriously consider the costs before proceeding.\nThis makes it different to all other Plutus Core terms, but we believe it is the expected behaviour: no language has strict case destructuring.\nConsider e.g.\ncase (Just 1) of Just x -> print \"Success!\" Nothing -> error \"Failure!\"\ncase (Just 1) of Just x -> print \"Success!\" Nothing -> error \"Failure!\"\nEven in a strict language like Rust, nobody would expect this to evaluate the Nothing branch and evaluate to an error.\nNothing\nFurthermore, this additional laziness has significant performance benefits, see Appendix 2 for more discussion.\nData\nData is expressive enough to encode datatypes, indeed this is why it is possible to encode the script context into it. It's performant enough that people who work with the script context as Data are able to get by. Moreover, lifting and unlifting to Data is very easy. So why not just use it to encode all datatypes?4\nData\nData\nData\nThere are two reasons:\nData\nTo justify 2, we benchmarked some list processing using datatypes implemented with SOPs and with Data, and the Data version is over 3x worse (not accounting for overhead, so the real figure may be higher).\nData\nData\nThe current solution is a sums-of-products solution, i.e. we have an introduction and elimination form for objects that have both a tag and a list of fields. We could instead separate these two parts out and have an introduction and elimination form for sums, likewise for products.\nThat would look something like this:\nt ::= ... -- Tags a term with a tag | (tag i t) -- Inspects a tagged term for the tag, and passes the -- inner term to the case function corresponding to the tag | (case t t...) -- Constructs a product with the given fields | (prod t...) -- Accesses the i'th field of the given product | (index i t)\nt ::= ... -- Tags a term with a tag | (tag i t) -- Inspects a tagged term for the tag, and passes the -- inner term to the case function corresponding to the tag | (case t t...) -- Constructs a product with the given fields | (prod t...) -- Accesses the i'th field of the given product | (index i t)\nThis is cleaner in some ways, and was the first prototype we implemented, but it has the following problems:\nThe design presented here allows the case branches to be arbitrary terms, which must be evaluated and then applied to the fields.\nA more complex design would be to have the bindings for the variables be part of the case expression instead. That is, the current design does this:\n(case (constr 1 a b) (\\x -> t1) (\\x y -> t2))\n(case (constr 1 a b) (\\x -> t1) (\\x y -> t2))\n(the literal lambdas here could be arbitrary terms)\nwhereas we could do this:\n(case (constr 1 x y) (alt x t1) (alt x y t2))\n(case (constr 1 x y) (alt x t1) (alt x y t2))\nThe effect of this is that we know statically that we have a function, and we can jump right into evaluating the body of the case branch instead of first having to evaluate it to a function and apply the arguments.\nThis saves us a small but meaningful amount of overhead at the cost of making the implementation significantly more complex.\nWe prototyped this version and it was noticeably faster (~10 ). However, performance investigations showed that we can realize a significant amount of the performance gain through other means, leaving only about 3 unclaimed.5 We think that this is an acceptable cost for a simpler implementation.\nconstr\ncase\nBoth constr and case in this proposal are saturated, meaning that they have all of the arguments that they need explicitly provided in the AST. This is not the only option.\nconstr\ncase\nWe could easily have unsaturated constr, by making (constr i) a function that then needs to be applied to its arguments. This would be mildly more complicated to implement, since we wouldn't know how many arguments to expect, and so we would need to always be able to add aditional arguments to a constr value, but this would be manageable.\nconstr\n(constr i)\nconstr\nUnsaturated case is more complicated. While the tag on the scrutinee constr value tells us which branch we are going to take in the end, we don't know how many branches we need in total. In principle we could extend the tags on constructors to include not only the selected tag but also the maximum tag. That would allow us to know how many case branches we need. A more serious problem is that we would not be able to be non-strict in the branches any more, as they would be passed as function arguments and hence forced.\ncase\nconstr\nThe main advantage of unsaturated constr and case is that it would avoid the need for n-ary terms in the language, as both would then have a fixed number of children. However, it makes them more complex to work with, and likely less efficient to implement. Finally, this is simply a less common design, and so conservatism suggests sticking to the more standard approach unless there is a compelling reason not to.\nconstr\ncase\nplutus\ncardano-ledger\nThis plan will be implemented by Michael Peyton Jones and the Plutus Core team with assistance from the Ledger team. The changes will be in the PlutusV3 ledger language at the earliest, which will probably arrive in the Conway ledger era.\nPlutusV3\nWhile Typed Plutus Core is not part of the specification of Cardano, it is still interesting and informative to give the changes here. Plutus Core was originally conceived of as a typed language, and making sure that we can express the changes cleanly in a typed setting means that we ensure that the semantics make sense and that it will continue to be easy to compile to Plutus Core from typed languages.\nWe add one new type constructors and one auxiliary constructor to the type language of Typed Plutus Core:\n-- List of types. This is an auxiliarry syntactic form, not a type! tyl ::= [ty...] ty ::= ... -- Sum-of-products type, has n children, each of which is a list of types | (sop tyl...)\n-- List of types. This is an auxiliarry syntactic form, not a type! tyl ::= [ty...] ty ::= ... -- Sum-of-products type, has n children, each of which is a list of types | (sop tyl...)\nThis corresponds to a sum-of-products type, and it has one list of types for each constructor, giving the argument types.\nWe add the following new term constructors to the Typed Plutus Core language:\nt ::= ... | (constr ty i t...) | (case ty t t...)\nt ::= ... | (constr ty i t...) | (case ty t t...)\nThese are identical to their untyped cousins, except that they include a type annotation for the type of the whole term. These make the typing rules much simpler, as otherwise we lack enough information to pin down the whole type.\nThe typing rules for the new terms are:\nThe reduction rules are essentially the same since the types do not affect evaluation.\nPerformance testing of the various prototypes revealed the following interesting facts:\nLet's look at these in turn.\nTo see why Scott encoding is so good, let's look at what happens when we 1) construct, and 2) destruct a typical datatype value, using sums-of-products but without binding case variables. We'll do this in the typed setting for clarity.\nLet s consider four programs, corresponding to creation and destruction of data XYZ = MkXY X Y | MkZ Z.\ndata XYZ = MkXY X Y | MkZ Z\nP1: Scott-encoded construction\n[ -- Scott-encoded constructor for MkXY (\\(x : X) (y : Y) . (/\\ R . \\(xyc : X -> Y -> R) (zc : Z -> R) . xyc x y) xx yy ]\n[ -- Scott-encoded constructor for MkXY (\\(x : X) (y : Y) . (/\\ R . \\(xyc : X -> Y -> R) (zc : Z -> R) . xyc x y) xx yy ]\nP2: Scott-encoded destruction\n[ { P1 r } -- case alternatives (\\(x : X) (y : Y) -> b1) (\\(z : Z) -> b2 ]\n[ { P1 r } -- case alternatives (\\(x : X) (y : Y) -> b1) (\\(z : Z) -> b2 ]\nP3: Explicit construction\nconstr 0 xx yy\nconstr 0 xx yy\nP4: Explicit matching\ncase P3 (\\(x : X) (y : Y) . b1) (\\(z : Z) . b2)\ncase P3 (\\(x : X) (y : Y) . b1) (\\(z : Z) . b2)\nP1 vs P3\nP2 vs P4\nScott encoding isn't doing anything clearly unnecessary: it's quite efficient at constructing values (because it just returns a function closure right away), and it's quite efficient at deconstructing values (because it just loads the constructor arguments into an environment and then applies the branch).\nIn particular, both ways we have to do a similar amount of work in a) evaluating the branch function, b) applying it to its arguments.\nThere are a few advantages for sums-of-products. The most important is that it does not evaluate all the case branches, only the one it needs. Whereas Scott-encoding passes the case branches as simple function arguments, so they are always evaluated before we proceed.\nThis makes a surprising amount of difference. We are performing so few steps already for each datatype match that adding a few more to evaluate unused case branches makes a difference.\nBinding case variables allows us to get rid of some of the work identified in the previous sections. A constr that binds case variables has two differences:\nconstr\nIn practice it seems that difference 1 makes a significant amount of difference, because even if the case branch is a literal lambda, we are forced to allocate a value for the lambda. Optimizing the evaluator to avoid this allocation removes a significant part of the advantage.\nDifference 2 does not seem to make as large a difference. If we did see a big difference here then we might want to investigate adding multi-lambdas to Plutus Core in order to gain this benefit in other places. In practice, however, it does not seem to be that significant, and prototypes of multi-lambdas have not performed well.\nThroughout, the following commits are referenced:\nmaster\ndf9b23f59852d11776fde382720df830c6163238\nsums-of-products\ne98b284204070053b2e64bb66c7aa0832520afec\nThese represent somewhat arbitrary snapshots. The sums-of-products branch represents the current prototype, and master is it's merge-base with plutus's master branch. These may be updated at a future date.\nsums-of-products\nmaster\nplutus\nmaster\nThese are benchmarks taken from the nofib benchmark suite used by GHC. They are defined in plutus-benchmark/nofib. They are not totally comprehensive, but they represent a reasonable survey of programs that do various kinds of general computation.\nnofib\nplutus-benchmark/nofib\nThese benchmarks are re-compiled from Haskell each time, so the comparison does not represent faster evaluation of the same script, but rather than we can now compile datatype operations using the new terms, which are faster overall.\nmaster\nsums-of-products\nThe results indicate that the speedup is more associated with programs that do lots of datatype manipulation, rather than those that do a lot of numerical work (which in Plutus Core means calling lots of builtin functions). However, we don't see any regression even in the primality tester, which is very numerically heavy (the noise threshold for the benchmarks is ~1 ).\nThese benchmarks are some real-world examples taken from plutus-use-cases. They are defined in plutus-benchmark/validation. They thus represent real-world workloads.\nplutus-use-cases\nplutus-benchmark/validation\nThe validation benchmarks are not recompiled, they are specific saved Plutus Core programs. These benchmarks thus only show changes in the performance of the Plutus Core evaluator itself.\nmaster\nsums-of-products\nThis is an average slowdown of 4 , which is not good at all. We do not want to have a negative impact on scripts that don't use the new constructs.\nHowever, this slowdown is very difficult to avoid. The GHC Core (GHC's intermediate language for Haskell programs) for both versions looks nearly identical, with the only differences being the introduction of new code for the new cases. We believe that this indicates that GHC simply produces slightly slower code when we have more constructs, even if those code paths are not used. In particular, there are some threshold effects when you cross certain numbers of constructors.\nWe tested this by doing an experiment that simply adds new unused constructors to the Plutus Core term type and evaluator frame type. This caused a slowdown of on average 2 . That's not enough to completely explain the loss, but we suspect that similar causes account for the rest (investigation is ongoing).\nThis is still bad -- a slowdown is still a slowdown -- but it's less bad because it's unavoidable if we ever want to increase the size of the language. We will pay this cost whenever we decide expand the language. Especially if the cost comes from threshold effects, it may be a one-time cost that we just have to pay on some occasion.\nThis benchmark compares lists implemented three ways: using SOPs, using builtin lists, and using Data. It is defined in plutus-benchmark/lists. The benchmark task is summing a list of 100 integers. All three versions are using the Plutus Tx compiler, so any overhead is identical, and the only difference is how the list operations are implemented in the end. There almost certainly is a decent amount of overhead (we did not attempt to measure it here), so the proportional difference in the underlying operations may in fact be greater.\nData\nplutus-benchmark/lists\nData\nUsing Data is much worse.

    "prompt": "CIP0086?",
    "completion": "This proposal extends the CIP-25 standard for defining and updating token metadata via transaction metadata, by providing a new mechanism to update token metadata without having to mint or burn tokens, while maintaining full backward compatibility with CIP-25. The new mechanism is capable of expressing metadata updates more efficiently than CIP-25 updates.\nOn Cardano s eUTxO ledger, native tokens exist without any inherently attached metadata. The ledger does not provide a direct method for preserving any information associated with an asset class of native tokens, as transactions move the tokens from one UTxO to another.\nThe Media NFT Metadata Standard (CIP-25) proposed an indirect way to attach metadata to an asset class using the metadata field (CBOR tag 721) of its minting transactions. When there are multiple minting transactions for the same asset class, the latest minting transaction s metadata overrides all previous metadata defined for that asset class.\nCIP-25 is widely supported across the Cardano community by blockchain indexers, wallet providers, marketplace applications, and other stakeholders. It has served the community quite well so far, in particular for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with static metadata (i.e. intended to be mostly immutable after minting).\nHowever, the CIP-25 metadata update mechanism is suboptimal because it requires tokens of the asset class to be minted or burned whenever its metadata is updated. This is incongruous with the often purely-informational purpose of metadata update transactions. While it may sometimes be convenient to combine token minting and metadata updates within the same transaction (e.g. to save on transaction fees), there is a broad range of applications where metadata updates need to be more frequent and independent from minting events.\nIn practice, there are three main drawbacks to the CIP-25 update mechanism:\nWe encountered these drawbacks during the development of an NFT gaming application, where thousands of NFTs correspond to game assets with properties (e.g. horse age, physical and mental abilities) that evolve both over time and as the NFTs participate in various game-related events on-chain. These properties do not need to interact with smart contract logic directly, which makes transaction metadata a more appropriate place to define them, rather than UTxO datums with complicated state-evolution logic.\nOur NFT gaming application is leveraging the Cardano immutable ledger, rather than an off-chain database, as the single source of truth to track the evolution of the game assets most important properties. This reassures users that the history of metadata states for a game NFT cannot be retroactively erased or altered by the game admins although the game admins have the authority to modify metadata going forward, they are retroactively accountable for all past updates.\nWe expect that this proposal will be useful to many other applications that need to track dynamic on-chain metadata for large NFT collections, particularly in the growing NFT gaming sector. It may also be useful for artists to update on-chain metadata about their art NFTs (e.g. royalty payment receiving address) without having to burn or mint anything.\nOur proposal extends CIP-25 with a new update mechanism:\nBoth CIP-25 and CIP-86 updates affect the token metadata:\nHowever, we recommend that CIP-86 adopters use the new metadata update mechanism exclusively to manage all updates to their token metadata after the initial CIP-25 metadata is set.\nOur proposal only affects the 86 top-level CBOR tag of the metadata field in Cardano transactions. (Note: we re using 86 as a stand-in for the CIP number that will eventually be assigned to this proposal.)\n86\n86\nA token metadata oracle is defined via two addresses:\nA metadata oracle can be explicitly assigned to a policy ID by setting the following metadata in a transaction that mints or burns tokens for that policy:\n{ \"86\": { \"assign_metadata_oracle\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"main_address\": \"<Shelley_address>\", \"update_address\": \"<Shelley_address>\" } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"assign_metadata_oracle\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"main_address\": \"<Shelley_address>\", \"update_address\": \"<Shelley_address>\" } } } }\nWhile a metadata oracle is not explicitly assigned to a native-script-based policy ID, the policy ID is implicitly assigned a metadata oracle with both addresses set to an address derived from the native script. Specifically, they are both set to an Enterprise address constructed by setting the payment key to the verification key from the native script and keeping the staking key empty.\nThe metadata oracle assignment for a policy ID can be updated via a transaction signed by the oracle main address key. The oracle assignment transaction must be signed by the signing key of the main oracle address, but it may contain any inputs and outputs, as these are ignored for the purposes of metadata oracle assignment.\nThe schema for updating an oracle assignment is the same as for the initial assignment in the minting transaction:\n{ \"86\": { \"assign_metadata_oracle\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"main_address\": \"<Shelley_address>\", \"update_address\": \"<Shelley_address>\" } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"assign_metadata_oracle\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"main_address\": \"<Shelley_address>\", \"update_address\": \"<Shelley_address>\" } } } }\nThe main_address or the update_address fields for a policyID can be omitted, in which case the addresses for the omitted fields remain the same for that policy ID.\nmain_address\nupdate_address\n<policyID>\nIf a metadata oracle was implicitly assigned to a policy ID before the assignment update, then the implicit assignment is replaced by the new explicit assignment.\nA simple metadata update transaction must be signed by the signing key of the oracle update address, but it may contain any inputs and outputs, as these are ignored for the purposes of updating token metadata.\nThe schema for simple metadata updates in CIP-86 is similar to the CIP-25 schema, but it is nested under 86.simple_metadata_update in the transaction metadata object.\n86.simple_metadata_update\n{ \"86\": { \"simple_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"<tokenName>\": { \"<metadataField>\": \"<metadataValue>\" } } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"simple_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"<tokenName>\": { \"<metadataField>\": \"<metadataValue>\" } } } } }\nTo remove a metadata field, set its value explicitly to null in the metadata update.\nnull\nThe schema for regex metadata updates is as follows:\n{ \"86\": { \"regex_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"<tokenNameRegex>\": { \"<metadataField>\": \"<metadataValue>\" } } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"regex_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"<tokenNameRegex>\": { \"<metadataField>\": \"<metadataValue>\" } } } } }\nA regex metadata update transaction must be signed by the signing key of the oracle update address, but it may contain any inputs and outputs, as these are ignored for the purposes of updating token metadata.\nThe only difference from the simple metadata update is that here the token names are defined in terms of PCRE regular expressions (regex). The regex metadata update applies to any previously minted token whose policy ID matches policyID and whose token name matches the tokenNameRegex regular expression.\n<policyID>\n<tokenNameRegex>\nFor example, the following metadata update would apply to every Equine pioneer horse between EquinePioneerHorse05000 and EquinePioneerHorse05999:\nEquinePioneerHorse05000\nEquinePioneerHorse05999\n{ \"86\": { \"regex_metadata_update\": { \"30ed3d95db1d6bb2c12fc5228a2986eab4553f192a12a4607780e15b\": { \"^EquinePioneerHorse05\\\\d{3}$\": { \"age\": 2 } } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"regex_metadata_update\": { \"30ed3d95db1d6bb2c12fc5228a2986eab4553f192a12a4607780e15b\": { \"^EquinePioneerHorse05\\\\d{3}$\": { \"age\": 2 } } } } }\nThe regular expression pattern in tokenNameRegex is defined according to the grammar in:\n<tokenNameRegex>\nTabular metadata updates use a condensed rectangular format to specify new values for a fixed set of fields for a large number of assets. Specifically, for each policy ID we provide an object with the following three fields:\nfield_paths\n\"images.background.sunset.url\"\ntoken_names\nvalues\ntoken_names\nvalues\nfield_paths\nvalues\ntoken_names\nvalues\nfield_paths\n{ \"86\": { \"tabular_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"field_paths\": [ \"<fieldPath>\" ], \"token_names\": [ \"<tokenName>\" ], \"values\": [ [\"<metadataValue>\"] ] } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"tabular_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"field_paths\": [ \"<fieldPath>\" ], \"token_names\": [ \"<tokenName>\" ], \"values\": [ [\"<metadataValue>\"] ] } } } }\nA tabular metadata update transaction must be signed by the signing key of the oracle update address, but it may contain any inputs and outputs, as these are ignored for the purposes of updating token metadata.\nFor example, the following update would apply updates to six metadata fields of five Equine horse NFTs:\n{ \"86\": { \"tabular_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"field_paths\": [ \"age\", \"stats.acceleration\", \"stats.agility\", \"stats.endurance\", \"stats.speed\", \"stats.stamina\" ], \"token_names\": [ \"EquinePioneerHorse00000\", \"EquinePioneerHorse00012\", \"EquinePioneerHorse00315\", \"EquinePioneerHorse01040\", \"EquinePioneerHorse09175\" ], \"values\": [ [3,34,16,18,51,33], [2,24,48,12,32,18], [3,33,34,41,14,31], [4,19,22,21,21,50], [1,24,11,36,22,14] ] } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"tabular_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"field_paths\": [ \"age\", \"stats.acceleration\", \"stats.agility\", \"stats.endurance\", \"stats.speed\", \"stats.stamina\" ], \"token_names\": [ \"EquinePioneerHorse00000\", \"EquinePioneerHorse00012\", \"EquinePioneerHorse00315\", \"EquinePioneerHorse01040\", \"EquinePioneerHorse09175\" ], \"values\": [ [3,34,16,18,51,33], [2,24,48,12,32,18], [3,33,34,41,14,31], [4,19,22,21,21,50], [1,24,11,36,22,14] ] } } } }\nIt is equivalent to the following simple metadata update:\n{ \"86\": { \"simple_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"EquinePioneerHorse00000\": { \"age\": 3, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 34, \"agility\": 16, \"endurance\": 18, \"speed\": 51, \"stamina\": 33 } }, \"EquinePioneerHorse00012\": { \"age\": 2, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 24, \"agility\": 48, \"endurance\": 12, \"speed\": 32, \"stamina\": 18 } }, \"EquinePioneerHorse00315\": { \"age\": 3, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 33, \"agility\": 34, \"endurance\": 41, \"speed\": 14, \"stamina\": 31 } }, \"EquinePioneerHorse01040\": { \"age\": 4, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 19, \"agility\": 22, \"endurance\": 21, \"speed\": 21, \"stamina\": 50 } }, \"EquinePioneerHorse09175\": { \"age\": 1, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 24, \"agility\": 11, \"endurance\": 36, \"speed\": 22, \"stamina\": 14 } } } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"simple_metadata_update\": { \"<policyId>\": { \"EquinePioneerHorse00000\": { \"age\": 3, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 34, \"agility\": 16, \"endurance\": 18, \"speed\": 51, \"stamina\": 33 } }, \"EquinePioneerHorse00012\": { \"age\": 2, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 24, \"agility\": 48, \"endurance\": 12, \"speed\": 32, \"stamina\": 18 } }, \"EquinePioneerHorse00315\": { \"age\": 3, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 33, \"agility\": 34, \"endurance\": 41, \"speed\": 14, \"stamina\": 31 } }, \"EquinePioneerHorse01040\": { \"age\": 4, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 19, \"agility\": 22, \"endurance\": 21, \"speed\": 21, \"stamina\": 50 } }, \"EquinePioneerHorse09175\": { \"age\": 1, \"stats\": { \"acceleration\": 24, \"agility\": 11, \"endurance\": 36, \"speed\": 22, \"stamina\": 14 } } } } } }\nLike CIP-25, CIP-86 supports two different methods of representing policy IDs and token name:\nBy default, all CIP-86 metadata updates use version 1. However, version 2 can be used if the version field of the object under the top-level \"86\" CBOR tag is set to 2.\nversion\n\"86\"\n2\nFor example:\n{ \"86\": { \"version\": 2, \"simple_metadata_update\": { \"<policyIdRawBytes>\": { \"<tokenNameRawBytes>\": { \"<metadataField>\": \"<metadataValue>\" } } } } }\n{ \"86\": { \"version\": 2, \"simple_metadata_update\": { \"<policyIdRawBytes>\": { \"<tokenNameRawBytes>\": { \"<metadataField>\": \"<metadataValue>\" } } } } }\nRegex updates are disallowed in version 2, because it is unclear how to apply regular expressions to non-UTF-8 bytestrings (or their corresponding hex encodings).\nUp to network consensus, the Cardano blockchain imposes a total ordering on transactions added to the chain each transaction can be indexed by the slot number of the block that added it to the chain, and the transaction s index within that block. Network nodes may disagree about which blocks have been added most recently to the blockchain; however, the disagreement about whether a particular transaction was added at a particular position in the total order decreases exponentially as more and more blocks are added to the chain.\nTo reconstruct the metadata state for a given asset class, scan through the sequence of transactions in a Cardano node s blockchain, applying the CIP-25 and CIP-86 updates in the order that they are encountered in this sequence. Should a transaction contain both CIP-25 and CIP-86 updates, then the CIP-25 updates should be applied first, followed by the CIP-86 updates. If a transaction contains both a CIP-25 update and a CIP-86 explicit oracle assignment, then the CIP-25 update will be applied as usual and the oracle addresses (main and/or update) will be set to those of the explicit CIP-86 oracle assignment. If the Cardano node rolls back some blocks from the chain tip, then roll back the updates from those blocks as well.\nWe recommend that token metadata oracle operators wait for their metadata update transactions to be confirmed at a sufficient block depth before submitting any subsequent metadata updates for the same asset classes. Doing so should minimize any confusion about the order of simultaneous pending metadata updates while the Cardano network settles toward consensus.\nA transaction can contain CIP-86 token metadata updates of different types, plus oracle assignment updates. In this case, apply the updates in the following sequence:\nWe recommend that token metadata oracle operators not mix multiple update types in the same transaction, unless they have a clear understanding of the outcome of applying the updates in the above sequence.\nThe CIP-86 token metadata indexer begins with a configuration of the policy IDs for which it will be tracking metadata. Optionally, it can be configured to track metadata for all tokens on Cardano.\nThe indexer monitors the blockchain for minting transactions. If such a minting transaction mints tokens of a tracked policy ID and contains an explicit oracle assignment and/or CIP-25 metadata for that policy ID, then the indexer caches that assignment and metadata in its database. If the transaction does not contain an explicit oracle assignment for the policy ID, and there is no prior oracle assignment, then the indexer caches the implicit oracle assignment for the policy ID in its database.\nThe indexer continues to monitor minting transactions for the policy IDs that it s tracking, applying oracle assignment updates and CIP-25 metadata updates accordingly in its database. A CIP-25 metadata update is applied as a wholesale replacement of the metadata cached in the indexer database for the respective asset classes.\nFor each oracle main address currently assigned to a policy ID, the indexer monitors the blockchain for transactions that contain oracle assignment updates in their metadata and are signed by the signing key of the main address. The indexer updates its database to reflect these explicit oracle assignments and removes any implicit assignments that were replaced by explicit assignments.\nFor each oracle update address currently assigned to a policy ID, the indexer monitors the blockchain for transactions that contain CIP-86 token metadata updates and are signed by the signing key of the update address. The indexer applies these metadata updates in the order defined in Order of application for updates. CIP-86 metadata updates are applied to the asset classes and metadata fields that they target, while keeping all other fields the same.\nTo be able to handle blockchain rollbacks, the indexer keeps track of past metadata states for its policy IDs, going back 2160 blocks (~12 hours) from the current blockchain tip. Cardano s securityParam Shelley Genesis parameter prevents nodes from rolling back more than 2160 blocks. If the Cardano node informs the indexer of a rollback, the indexer restores the past metadata state that existed immediately before all the metadata updates in the rolled-back blocks were applied.\nsecurityParam\nFor compatibility with existing applications that are already relying on CIP-25 metadata indexers, the CIP-86 indexer provides a similar API so that those applications can get and display the current CIP-86 token metadata in the same way that they have been for CIP-25 metadata. The indexer indicates that it is following the CIP-86 standard.\nWe pursued the following design goals in our solution:\nWe maintain full backward compatibility with CIP-25:\nWe recognize CIP-86 updates only if they are issued by an oracle currently assigned for the corresponding policy IDs. This assignment is either directly authorized by the token issuer (explicitly or implicitly) or else indirectly authorized by the token issuer via the delegated authority that the token issuer placed in the originally assigned oracle to transfer the assignment to other oracles. Therefore, all authority to post valid CIP-86 updates about a token originates from the token issuer.\nAn alternative design could have oracles that declare themselves as sources of metadata for tokens, without authorization from anyone, and then users could voluntarily subscribe to the metadata oracles that they wish to follow. However, such an approach would make it very difficult for the Cardano ecosystem to converge on a single objective metadata state for a token, as each user would have his own subjective view of token metadata based on his oracles subscriptions. This alternative approach could be interesting to allow secondary/auxiliary metadata to be defined for tokens, but it is unsuitable for the primary metadata that CIP-25 and CIP-86 seek to manage.\nWe use two addresses to identify an oracle when assigning it to a policy ID. It would be simpler to use a single oracle address, but we chose to separate the main address (authorized to reassign the oracle) from the update address (authorized to post updates) for an oracle. We did this to mitigate the risk of using the update address in an automated process on a network machine, and to allow the update address to be safely rotated via a transaction that can only be signed on a cold storage or hardware wallet device using the main address.\nInstead of using addresses to identify oracles, we could have identified oracles by minting policies (not the minting policies to which oracles are assigned). In this alternative design, a minting policy X could have an assigned oracle identified by minting policy A. Under such an assignment, a CIP-86 update for a token under X would be valid if the update transaction consumed a utxo that contained a token of minting policy A. In other words, the holder of an A token would be allowed to post metadata updates about any X tokens.\nX\nA\nX\nA\nA\nX\nThis minting-policy-based alternative for identifying oracles may be more advantageous for more flexibly managing oracle authorization (including rate-limiting, time-boxing, etc.) and proving data provenance to on-chain scripts. These advantages are relevant for oracles that provide information in utxo datums meant for use in smart contracts, but they are not as relevant for this CIP, where we seek to provide a method to provide updateable token metadata via transaction metadata (as a direct extension of CIP-25). Furthermore, it is easier to track transactions originating from a given address in an indexer than to keep track of all the people who control various authorization tokens, at a given time.\nIn the first draft of this proposal, we prohibited CIP-86 oracle assignment updates and metadata updates from occurring in transactions that mint tokens, in order to avoid awkward clashes with CIP-25 metadata transactions. This was removed because, while it likely does not make sense to create CIP-25 and CIP-86 metadata for the same token in one transaction, it could feasibly make sense to want to update the metadata for other tokens while minting another one.\nWe also originally required CIP-86 updates to occur in transactions that only send ADA from an oracle address (main or update, as appropriate), to prevent unforeseen interactions with other mechanisms that may have negative consequences. This requirement was removed for two reasons. First, the reasoning above does not establish any specific issues with other transaction types. Second, it is too restrictive and creates unnecessary additional transactions for long sequences of updates, causing the update issuer to spend unnecessary transaction fees. Therefore, we decided to remove these unnecessary restrictions on CIP-86 update transactions.\nThe implicit method of assigning a metadata oracle is needed to allow existing token issuers to opt into the CIP-86 update mechanism. Their minting policies may no longer allow any more token minting or burning, which would prevent the token issuers from being able to explicitly assign an oracle via a CIP-25 update for those policies. The implicit assignment method bootstraps the CIP-86 update mechanism for these policies.\nThe implicit address is of the Enterprise address type, to avoid having to deal with staking keys. If needed, the metadata oracle operator can send ADA to the Enterprise address, and then spend it if the operator still controls the payment key of that Enterprise address.\nOpting out of the CIP-86 update mechanism can be done by explicitly assigning an oracle with addresses from which ADA cannot be spent (e.g. Plutus AlwaysFails). If the minting policy does not allow any more minting or burning, then this is an irreversible opt-out.\nWhen managing large collections of thousands of NFTs, one often needs to set a given field to the same value for many NFTs. Doing this individually for each NFT via CIP-25 updates or CIP-86 simple updates is inefficient, so we have proposed the regex metadata update as a succinct way to specify a mapping from multiple token names to a single metadata update.\nAnother common use case for dynamic token metadata involves having a set of volatile fields that should receive relatively frequent updates, but where those updates should be different for each NFT. Labeling each field value update with its field name for each NFT is very verbose, especially if the field is deeply nested within the metadata schema for the NFT. For this use case, we have proposed the tabular metadata update format as a way to avoid this repetition field names/paths are defined once in the column names of a rectangular table and applied consistently for each row of updated metadata field values.\nRectangular tables are a standard format used in the data analytics field for these situations.\nThis proposal may be considered active if:\nEquine and MLabs are collaborating on developing the indexer described in this CIP and the Equine NFT gaming application will be using CIP-86 updates to manage metadata updates for its large collection of thousands of NFTs under multiple minting policies.\nWe will include detailed documentation, example configurations, and tutorials on how to adapt the tools to new projects.\nWe are actively engaged in discussions with other stakeholders in the Cardano ecosystem that are interested in adopting this CIP to their projects, platforms, and tools.\nThis CIP is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC-BY-4.0).\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0088?",
    "completion": "Currently, token projects (NFT or FT) have no mechanism to register the intent, details, or feature set of their minting policy on-chain. This CIP will aim to create a method that is backwards compatible and enable projects to declare, and update over time, the supported feature set and metadata details pertaining to their tokens.\nThis CIP will aim to make use of a hybrid (on and off-chain) information schema to enable maximum flexibility and adaptability as new and novel use cases for native assets expand and grow over time.\nThis CIP was borne out of a distaste for the lack of on-chain token policy intent registration that has been cited as both a centralization and security concern at various points over the preceding two years of native asset history on Cardano.\nExample 1: The Cardano Token Registry\nMany Fungible Token (FT) projects require special treatment of their native assets such as decimal places for proper display and formatting, project information, and token logo. As it stands, these projects must currently register via a GitHub repository (Cardano Token Registry) in order to have their token properly appear in wallets. This GitHub repository is currently managed by the Cardano Foundation (CF). While there is no reason to believe that the CF would take any malicious or nefarious action, forcing token projects to register in this fashion introduces a point of centralization, potential gate keeping, and ultimately reliance on the interaction of a 3rd party (the human at CF responsible for merging pull requests) in order for projects to register, or update, their information.\nNote: The original intent of the CIP-26 Cardano Token Registry was never to have a sole provider or controller of the repository. However, time has shown that there is little interest from the community or various service providers to contribute or participate in this or alternative solutions.\nThis CIP attempts to provide a decentralized solution to this problem.\nExample 2: Token Metadata Insecurity\nOne of the stated rationales for CIP-68 was that the \"original\" Cardano NFT Metadata Standard (CIP-25) was insecure in some example use cases. This is due to the link between the transactional metadata and the minting of native assets. For example, a smart contract that cannot/does not validate against transaction metadata (i.e. Liquidity Pool tokens) could have a malicious user inject CIP-25 metadata into the transaction, potentially inserting illicit, illegal, or otherwise nefarious metadata information tied to the tokens which may be picked up and displayed to end users unwittingly by explorers and wallets.\nExample 3: De-duplication of Data\nSimilar to Example 1 above, when it comes to Non-Fungible Token (NFT) projects currently operating on the chain there is usually a desire to provide some level of information that pertains to all tokens under the given policy. Examples include project/collection names, social media handles, and miscellaneous project registration information. At current, this is generally solved by adding \"static\" fields in the metadata of every token. By moving this project-specific information a layer higher, not only do we achieve a path to dynamism but also reduce ledger bloat size by de-duplicating data.\nSimilarly, there are currently multiple marketplaces and decentralized exchanges (DEXes) in operation in the Cardano ecosystem. At current, most DEXes pull information from the Cardano Token Registry but there is no similar function for NFT projects. As such, much information must be manually provided to individual marketplaces by the token projects creating an undue burden on the project creators to provide a largely static amount of information via different web forms and authentication schemes rather than simply publishing this information to the blockchain directly.\nCPS-0001 presents a problem of metadata discoverability and trust. This CIP attempts to address and solve several of the issues proposed in CPS-0001 but is most likely not a \"complete\" solution and is rather narrowed (for the time being) to the scope of token projects although with some refinement to the schema could potentially be expanded to support additional scopes.\nThe primary purpose of this CIP is to enhance discoverability of token projects utilizing and parsing only the information contained on-chain. In the first version of this CIP we address the discoverability of top-level information related to \"Token Projects\" such as NFT and FT projects needing to provide social media handles, human-friendly names, etc.\nThe goal of both minimizing redundant data stored on-chain and enhancing discoverability of projects for platforms like DExes and NFT Marketplaces is specifically referenced in Example #3 above.\nNote that while some external chain indexing and validation will ultimately be required, there is no off-chain, centralized or decentralized trusted repository of additional information required (although aspects of the metadata provided may rely on off-chain storage solutions).\nThis CIP aims to ensure metadata \"correctness\" on two different fronts.\nAs mentioned in the Data Provenance note on Data Correctness above, this CIP minimizes the trust required by relying on a verifiable witness signature versus currently existing solutions which largely rely on off-chain trust mechanisms for proof of provenance. Therefore, we increase trust in the data by describing a relatively simple means of data validation while decreasing the need for trust outside the scope of the on-chain metadata.\nWhere applicable the 0 (zero) index of all specification documents is reserved for an optional integer version identifier to enable future extensions to this and CIP-specific sub-standards.\nA numeric-indexed structure is used to support required and optional fields in a format that is compatible with both CBOR and JSON transport formats with minimal changes to the data structure and to minimize the possibility of misspelling or capitalization issues.\nThis standard is likely to need frequent extension and modification, particularly relating to CIP-Specific Information. Any group or individual wishing to extend or modify this standard MUST comply to the following criteria:\nActive\nrequired\nversion\n1\nVersion: 1\nVersion: 1\nThe Token Registration Payload Object (TRPO) consists of 4 required fields and optional additional fields to provide context and information. The top-level metadata label of 867 has been chosen for the purposes of this standard.\nThe following fields are required in all token registration submissions.\nCurrently, this CIP concerns itself with the scope of Tokens with relation to CPS-0001 as described in the Motivation section. However, the specification is left flexible to encapsulate additional scopes and contexts (Stake Pools, dApps, etc.) should the specification become adopted and the community desire to expand the scope of this CIP.\nScopes\n[0, h'policyID', [h'policyHex']]\nExample:\n[0, h'3668b628d7bd0cbdc4b7a60fe9bd327b56a1902e89fd01251a34c8be', h'8200581c4bdb4c5017cdcb50c001af21d2488ed2e741df55b252dd3ab2482050']\n[0, h'3668b628d7bd0cbdc4b7a60fe9bd327b56a1902e89fd01251a34c8be', h'8200581c4bdb4c5017cdcb50c001af21d2488ed2e741df55b252dd3ab2482050']\nThe Feature Set is a simple array of unsigned integer values representing the CIP standards that should be applied to the subject scope.\nExample:\n[25, 27]\n[25, 27]\nIn order to minimize issues relating to capitalization and misspellings, we should use a well-defined map of integer values for validation methods that will be utilized by third party observers and processors to authenticate the payload. The validation method entry should always be provided as an array with the first element being an unsigned integer representing the method and additional entries providing additional context to the validation as required.\nProposed Validation Methods\n[0]\n[1, [h'<policyId>',h'<assetId>']]\nExamples:\n[0], [1, [h' policyId ',h' assetId ']]\n[0]\n[1, [h'<policyId>',h'<assetId>']]\nThe nonce value is utilized to prevent a replay attack vector. The nonce value should be an unsigned integer value that is always at least one greater than the previously registered value.\nExample:\n12345\n12345\nTo be utilized and expanded upon in a separate CIP, this should be a valid URI pointing to a source of additional, potentially dynamic information relating to the project and/or the tokens minted under it.\nExample:\n[ \"https://\", \"oracle.mytokenproject.io/\" ]\n[ \"https://\", \"oracle.mytokenproject.io/\" ]\nThis entry, if present, should be a CIP ID indexed object containing additional information pertaining to that CIP. When and where possible the CIP-Specific registration should follow the CBOR-like declaration syntax to ensure that the content is well-formed and easily parseable.\nNote: CIP-0068 Tokens\nDue to a lack of clarity in the original language of CIP-0068, standards for fungible, non-fungible, and \"rich\" fungible tokens have been added to the core standard. To accommodate for this, projects should use the CIP-68 data when using the 222 (NFT) or 444 (RFT) tokens for top-level project information. Projects utilizing the 333 (FT) style tokens should utilize the CIP-26 data structure to provide fungible token context.\n222\n444\n333\nBeacon Token Registration\nWhere applicable to a specific CIP, the CIP-specific registration may refer to a \"beacon token\". This is standardized in this CIP as a two-element array consisting of the hex-encoded policy ID and asset ID of the token to be used as a beacon token for the purposes of smart contract interactions. e.g. [ h' policy_id ', h' asset_id ' ]\n[ h'<policy_id>', h'<asset_id>' ]\nMultiple Feature Set Example (CBOR):\n{ 25: { 0: 1, 1: { 0: \"Cool NFT Project\", 1: [ \"This is a description of my project\", \"longer than 64 characters so broken up into a string array\" ], 2: [ \"https://\", \"static.coolnftproject.io\", \"/images/icon.png\" ], 3: [ \"https://\", \"static.coolnftproject.io\", \"/images/banner1.jpg\" ], 4: 0, 5: [ [ \"twitter\", [ \"https://\", \"twitter.com/spacebudzNFT\" ] ], [ \"discord\", [ \"https://\", \"discord.gg/spacebudz\" ] ] ], 6: \"Virtua Metaverse\" } }, 27: { 0: 1, 1: { 1: \"0.05\", 2: [ \"addr_test1qqp7uedmne8vjzue66hknx87jspg56qhkm4gp6ahyw7kaahevmtcux\", \"lpy25nqhaljc70094vfu8q4knqyv6668cvwhsq64gt89\" ] } } }\n{ 25: { 0: 1, 1: { 0: \"Cool NFT Project\", 1: [ \"This is a description of my project\", \"longer than 64 characters so broken up into a string array\" ], 2: [ \"https://\", \"static.coolnftproject.io\", \"/images/icon.png\" ], 3: [ \"https://\", \"static.coolnftproject.io\", \"/images/banner1.jpg\" ], 4: 0, 5: [ [ \"twitter\", [ \"https://\", \"twitter.com/spacebudzNFT\" ] ], [ \"discord\", [ \"https://\", \"discord.gg/spacebudz\" ] ] ], 6: \"Virtua Metaverse\" } }, 27: { 0: 1, 1: { 1: \"0.05\", 2: [ \"addr_test1qqp7uedmne8vjzue66hknx87jspg56qhkm4gp6ahyw7kaahevmtcux\", \"lpy25nqhaljc70094vfu8q4knqyv6668cvwhsq64gt89\" ] } } }\nThe Witness Array included in the on-chain metadata should consist of an array of arrays with two elements, the public key of the signing key and the signed key witness. If a script requires multiple signatures, enough signatures to meet the criteria of the script should be included and required for proper validation of an updated token registration.\nThe signing payload should be the hex-encoded Token Registration Payload Object.\nExample\n[ [ h'02b76ae694ce6549d4a20dce308bc7af7fa5a00c7d82b70001e044e596a35deb',

metadata transaction and without any required modification or customization to the underlying ledger.\nBy leveraging the existing signing keys present in native asset scripts from the beginning of the Mary Era on Cardano we can enable all projects to update and provide additional, verified information about their project in a canonical, verifiable, and on-chain way while also providing for additional off-chain information.\nThis makes this CIP backwards compatible with all existing standards (CIP-25, 26, 27, 68, etc) while also providing the flexibility for future-proofing and adding additional context and information in the future as additional use cases, utility, and standards evolve.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "The Untyped Plutus Language Core (UPLC) has established itself as the target language for a host of emerging Smart Contract Languages. These languages implement type safety by checking the types of variables at compile time. In the compiled output, type information is absent and no longer required or checked. This proposal suggests replacing or enhancing the set of builtin functions with untyped builtin functions, whose arguments are devoid of any type instantiations. This change aims to improve performance and reduce resource costs.\nMany currently available UPLC builtin functions require forcing between 1 and 3 times to eliminate type instantiations checked at a higher level language of the toolstack (PLC), which most third-party tools do not use. These forces only burn cycles of nodes that evaluate contracts, since there is no actual type instantiation happening internally. By removing the need for these no-op force operations, this proposal aims to enhance performance and reduce resource costs.\nThere is one data point as to how much performance improvement this may bring in the non-optimized case here. However, the performance improvement in the optimized case is generally constant: One can bind the forced builtins to a variable at the outermost layer of the UPLC program and from there on just use the forced builtins.\nFor all existing UPLC Builtin Functions x that require n 0 forces for evaluation, this proposal suggests to implement the builtin function x' without any required forces.\nThis proposal suggests that all existing UPLC Builtin Functions x be replaced by x'. Generally, this proposal also suggests that no further Builtin Functions be defined that require force.\nforce\nThis proposal reduces the resources needed to evaluate builtin functions by removing the need to apply no-op force operations to them. However, the actual performance impact might be negligible, and the main impact could be on simplifying the language and making it easier for compiler writers. These are weaker reasons than widespread performance improvements. Implementing this proposal may also require a new Plutus ledger language, as described in CIP-35, due to the non-backwards-compatible changes.\nThe implementation will break the backward compatibility for future Plutus Smart Contracts.\nplutus\ncardano-ledger\nIt is currently not planned to implement this proposal.\nThis CIP is licensed under [CC-BY-4.0]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "The proposed Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) outlines a conventional structure for data payloads that are signed by wallets, which can be used by decentralized application (dApp) servers to authenticate user requests. By leveraging the Cardano blockchain as an identity provider, dApp servers can securely and trustlessly verify user identities without relying on centralized servers or third-party services. This CIP aims to provide a standard approach for implementing wallet signature authentication in dApps, improving the security and reliability of user interactions with decentralized systems.\nThe cardano wallets have the ability to sign arbitrary piece of data as we can see in the Message signing CIP-0008. All wallets implement the method api.signData(addr: Address, payload: Bytes): Promise DataSignature defined in Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge CIP-0030.\napi.signData(addr: Address, payload: Bytes): Promise<DataSignature>\ndApps generate arbritary payloads as byte arrays. These payloads are signed and included in the protected headers of the signatures. The wallets are responsible for showing the payload data to the user, who will proceed to sign or reject the payload. It's a common practice to encode a string or a JSON string but there isn't any standard for the way to construct and to show this data.\nThe current implementations for web3 applications use static strings. This is dangerous because if a bad actor intercepts the signed message then it can be used in a replay attack by the bad actor. That's why it is very important to produce a dynamic payload rather a static string.\nAnother problem with the current approach is how the wallets show the information contained in the payload. The payload is a encoded byte array and it could contain anything. If Alice want to call an endpoint and Bob has the ability to change the message before Alice gets it. Alice must be notified somehow that she is signing a potentially malicious payload. A simple hex-encoded representation of the payload isn't enough to ensure a safe interaction.\nThis specification involves multiple parties: Wallet/Client, dApp Server and Blockchain.\nWallet/Client: The Wallet/Client is responsible for managing the user's cryptographic keys. Anyone can create a wallet using the CIP-0030 API interface, but it may produce invalid or malicious data sent to the dApp. This CIP aims to validate the ownership and veracity of the data provided by wallets. Additionally, it establishes guidelines for mitigating common wallet attacks, improving security for user interaction.\ndApp Server: The dApp Server represents the server-side infraestructure that supports decentralized applications (dApps). It communicates with the blockchain to retrieve stored data and validate wallet status. It must enforce minimum payload requirements to ensure authenticity and protect users from malicious actors.\nBlockchain: The Blockchain is the underlying distributed ledger technology that forms the foundation of decentralized systems. It is a decentralized and immutable ledger that securely records all transactions and data in a chronological and transparent manner. The Blockchain can be utilized for authentication, providing user identity, and for authorization, tracking user history and current status.\n+-----------+ +---------------+ +----------------+ | Wallet/ | | dApp Server | | Blockchain | | Client | | | | | +-----------+ +---------------+ +----------------+ | | | | | | | 1.

JSON strings are semi-structured data that are human-readable. So that with a straightforward decoding into text, it will be understandable for the readers. This feature also allows the users to debug it in an easy manner, for example, with the browser debugger tools.\nThe content of the payload will be included in the protected header of the COSESign1 signature, hence the content effects directly the behavior and security of the system. The payload MUST have the following fields:\nThe field uri MUST contain the full path to the endpoint, where the payload will be processed.\nuri\nSometimes, the endpoint uri field is not enough to determine its purpose. The user should understand perfectly the objective of the payload which he or she is signing. That's why the payload MUST contain an action field with a descriptive text containing the purpose of the payload. For example, if someone calls the endpoint /users without an action field, they can create or delete users. However, by including the action field in the payload, it not only provides additional clarity but also effectively limits the scope of the payload.\nuri\naction\n/users\nIn order to improve globalization, the payload MAY include an actionText field that represents the action in the locale of the user. When present, the wallet MUST display this field to the user. By including the actionText field, the wallet facilitates the processing of the action field, eliminating the need for the server to be aware of the user's locale and the possible variants of the action text.\nactionText\nactionText\nThe payload MUST include either a UNIX timestamp or a slot number. The slot field represents a specific time in the blockchain and serves as a reference for synchronization between the client and the server. The timestamp or slot number is also used as a nonce and serves as an indicator for payload expiration in case the payload is compromised.\ntimestamp\nslot\nslot\ntimestamp\nslot\nAdditional fields MAY be included in the payload, and these fields can be string fields or objects. Depending on the specific process or use case, including additional fields in the protected header of the signature can provide valuable functionality and security enhancements. For example, in a registration request, it may be useful to include the email information as an additional field in the protected header. By doing so, the payload can be uniquely associated with that specific email, ensuring its integrity and preventing tampering.\n{ \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"uri\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uri\" }, \"action\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"actionText\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"timestamp\": { \"anyOf\": [ { \"type\": \"integer\" }, { \"type\": \"string\", \"pattern\": \"^\\\\d+$\" } ] }, \"slot\": { \"anyOf\": [ { \"type\": \"integer\" }, { \"type\": \"string\", \"pattern\": \"^\\\\d+$\" } ] } }, \"required\": [\"uri\", \"action\"], \"oneOf\": [{ \"required\": [\"timestamp\"] }, { \"required\": [\"slot\"] }], \"additionalProperties\": { \"type\": [\"string\", \"object\"] } }\n{ \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"uri\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uri\" }, \"action\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"actionText\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"timestamp\": { \"anyOf\": [ { \"type\": \"integer\" }, { \"type\": \"string\", \"pattern\": \"^\\\\d+$\" } ] }, \"slot\": { \"anyOf\": [ { \"type\": \"integer\" }, { \"type\": \"string\", \"pattern\": \"^\\\\d+$\" } ] } }, \"required\": [\"uri\", \"action\"], \"oneOf\": [{ \"required\": [\"timestamp\"] }, { \"required\": [\"slot\"] }], \"additionalProperties\": { \"type\": [\"string\", \"object\"] } }\n{ \"uri\": \"http://example.com/signin\", \"action\": \"Sign in\", \"timestamp\": 1673261248, }\n{ \"uri\": \"http://example.com/signin\", \"action\": \"Sign in\", \"timestamp\": 1673261248, }\n{ \"uri\": \"http://example.com/signup\", \"action\": \"Sign up\", \"timestamp\": \"1673261248\", \"email\": \"email@example.com\" } { \"uri\": \"http://example.com/signup\", \"action\": \"SIGN_UP\", \"actionText\": \"Registrar\", \"slot\": 94941399 }\n{ \"uri\": \"http://example.com/signup\", \"action\": \"Sign up\", \"timestamp\": \"1673261248\", \"email\": \"email@example.com\" } { \"uri\": \"http://example.com/signup\", \"action\": \"SIGN_UP\", \"actionText\": \"Registrar\", \"slot\": 94941399 }\nThe wallets can improve the overall security implementing the following guidelines. We RECOMMEND to show in a structured way the payload information for sake of clarity. This information should be well understood by the users before the payload is signed.\nThe uri field provides information about the hostname of the application. This hostname MUST be included in the wallet allow list. If a known domain A tries to sign a payload for an unknown domain B, you will be prompted with permission popup making more obvious the cross-domain interaction. When possible, the wallet SHOULD warn the user if a payload is for a different domain.\nuri\nThe wallet SHOULD update the timestamp field to the current time just before the signature. This field ideally should match the moment just before the signature such that the server receives fresh payload.\ntimestamp\nThe server has ultimate responsibility of processing correctly the requests. We use the content to validate the payload. The request will be processed with the following steps:\nThe server MUST check the action and the endpoint included in the request. Each route to an endpoint MUST have an associated action and a URI. The first step is to check that they match with the parameterized action.\nThe server MUST check the expiration of the payload. The expiration SHOULD be enough to give time to the user to introduce the wallet password but it SHOULD NOT be too long, we RECOMMEND not more than 5 minutes.\nThe server MUST validate the COSESign1 signature and check that the address inside the protected map of the signature corresponds to the public key in the COSEKey.\nAdditionally the server COULD extract the payload content and pass it through the server logic.\nCIP-0008 enhances authentication by enabling individuals to prove ownership of addresses, identities, and off-chain data through message signing. It provides a reliable means of authentication by allowing individuals to attach a public key to their data and sign messages associated with that data, thereby establishing ownership and ensuring the integrity of the authentication process.\nAdditionally, This specification provides the general guidelines and necessary recommendations for performing secure authenticated web3 requests in the Cardano ecosystem. It covers the two main desired characteristics for a secure payload: It must expire and it must be non-static. Moreover, the signature method proposed in this CIP does not require users to spend funds in a transaction, which further lowers the cost and barriers to entry for users.\nAnother important aspect for security is how wallets process the payload. They can improve the security using the data inside the payload to warn the users about possible malicious interactions. This specification emphasizes the importance of informing users clearly about the purpose of the payloads and how wallets can use the URI field to apply allow-lists and/or cross-domain policies. It establishes also the requirements and recommendations for server side processing. The server must also ensure the validity of the signature and the payload, as well as of its purpose in order to accomplish the authentication.\nIn addition to the aforementioned aspects, this CIP also aims to promote decentralization and enhance security and privacy by enabling users to sign and verify transactions without relying on external servers or third parties. By allowing users to create and sign their own payloads, this specification reduces the dependency on centralized authorities and enhances the security and privacy of the transactions.\nDuring discussions about this specification, the possibility of modifying CIP-0008 to incorporate the standards defined here was considered. However, a thorough evaluation revealed that this approach would require extensive modifications to CIP-0008 and CIP-0030, leading to significant changes in the Cardano wallet API. Moreover, it would result in a lengthy waiting period for browser wallet developers to implement the necessary requirements. This could potentially bypass important security measures outlined in this CIP, such as the requirement for human readability.\nWhile this alternative approach brings advantages, such as defining the payload in CBOR, which aligns well with Cardano, it also presents challenges. JSON and CBOR offer different levels of expressiveness, and the choice between the two depends on the specific needs of the application. JSON provides a more flexible and widely supported data format, whereas CBOR offers a more compact and efficient representation, particularly beneficial when working with the blockchain.\nConsidering these factors, it was concluded that deploying this standard as it currently stands, while coexisting with a future version that allows users to choose between JSON and CBOR payloads, would be the most practical approach. This would provide sufficient time for modifying CIP-0008 and CIP-0030, enabling browser wallet developers to fulfill the requirements for human readability and make necessary adjustments to the wallet API. Consequently, a version 2 of this CIP can be introduced, incorporating COSESign and CBOR, accommodating both realms, and ensuring broad support.\nThe payload signature ensures wallet ownership without incurring transaction fees. However, requiring the user to enter their spending password for every authenticated request can be inconvenient for the user experience. To address this, it is recommended to restrict the use of the payload signature to only important requests such as login, sign up, or other critical operations depending on the dApp requirements.\nA common practice is to request the user's signature for the login process, and once authenticated, the dApp can issue a session token, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT), to manage the session. By implementing this approach, future non-critical requests can be performed using standard web 2.0 methods, eliminating the need to enter the spending password for each step. This significantly enhances the usability of the application, providing a smoother user experience.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "The Cardano Foundation proposes a mechanism for polling Cardano stake pool operators on specific topics. Polls are done on-chain through transaction metadata and authenticated through stake pool credentials (Ed25519 cold key). The goal is to gather opinions on governance matters such as protocol parameter updates. This standard is an inclusive interim solution while the work on a larger governance framework such as CIP-1694 continues.\nGovernance is difficult. Discussions on CIP-1694 can attest to that quite clearly. There are constant debates within the Cardano community about changing protocol parameters, and the decision ultimately falls -- at this stage still -- onto the three genesis entities: Input Output, The Cardano Foundation and Emurgo. Yet, at this stage, few governance tools are at their disposal to make educated decisions. Besides Twitter polls, newsletter surveys, and SPO town halls on Discord, we have identified a gap and an opportunity to engage with the Cardano community through means currently at our disposal.\nConducting an on-chain poll between SPOs can also be seen as an experiment and an evaluation of the network's participation and engagement in the governance questions. Even though we only propose to poll one particular group of the Cardano community (the SPOs), such events can help to provide actual data to fuel the conversations around CIP-1694.\nIn summary, the goals are:\nPolls will be multiple-choice questions by The Cardano Foundation with pre-defined answers to choose from.\nHere's an example of a question and answers:\nThe serialised question and answers will be posted on-chain and signed by one of the delegate genesis keys owned by The Cardano Foundation. Answers will be provided on-chain by participating SPOs via transaction metadata referring to:\nNote In this document, every time we refer to a serialized object, we refer to its canonical CBOR representation. In particular, keys in a map are always ordered alphabetically.\nA question is posted in a transaction's metadata using the metadata label 94 and the following metadata structure:\n94\nquestion = { 0: prompt , 1: [ * choice ] , ? \"_\": nonce } prompt = [ * text .size (0..64) ] choice = [ * text .size (0..64) ] nonce = uint\nquestion = { 0: prompt , 1: [ * choice ] , ? \"_\": nonce } prompt = [ * text .size (0..64) ] choice = [ * text .size (0..64) ] nonce = uint\nA nonce is optionally included to provide non-replayability should the same question and answers be asked multiple times over different periods. The transaction carrying a question must be signed by one of the genesis delegate keys to be considered valid. This genesis key signature isn't captured in the metadata but in the transaction itself as an extra signatory.\nFor example:\nSimilarly, an answer to a question is posted as transaction's metadata using the label 94 and the following metadata structure:\n94\nanswer = { 2: question_hash , 3: choice } question_hash = bytes .size 32\nanswer = { 2: question_hash , 3: choice } question_hash = bytes .size 32\nSome remarks:\n2\nquestion_hash\n94\n3\n1\nFor example:\nThe transaction carrying the answer metadata must then be signed using a stake pool operator cold key. Because cold key are not payment keys, it is required to specify an extra required signer on the transaction (transaction's field number 14 as per Babbage's CDDL) to prevent malicious nodes from potentially propagating transactions without the necessary key witnesses.\nAlternatively, operators that are unable to sign arbitrary transactions due to hardware limitations can opt for stake pool update-registration certificate and attach the transaction metadata to it. Because an update-registration requires a signature from the cold key, the extra required signer field is redundant in that situation.\nRegardless of the method, the signature shall be produced in an air-gapped environment only.\nWarning\nOnly the first answer to a poll for each credential shall be considered. If multiple answers are found, only the first answer submitted (transaction & block ordering tallying) shall be considered.\nIt is possible to optionally attach extra context to the transaction as metadata following the procedure described in CIP-0020. Beside the structure specified in CIP-0020, such extra metadata is free-form and can be used to signal an intention behind a choice, or to voice a concern, or simply to give extra context. This is totally optional though we encourage SPOs to use this to inform their delegators of their choices.\nA poll starts when a valid transaction with a question is posted on-chain. Answers can be submitted until the end of the following epoch, so there is always at least one whole epoch to answer the poll.\nAfter one or more epochs in which the Stake Pool Operators have cast their answers, there follows a period of one or more epochs in which Cardano delegators may respond: If they disagree with the choice of their current stake pool, they can delegate to another pool. This changes the stake weight and thus influences the result. At the current state, the epochs for the answer and redelegation phase are only defined off-chain. In the future, they could also be defined as part of the signed question.\nIndirectly, this results in the possibility of participation for all Ada holders.\nThe outcome of a poll will depend on its level of participation (in terms of stake). It is essential to understand that we explicitly call this a poll / survey and not a vote to dispel any possible confusion. So it is akin to 1 Lovelace = 1 Voice although we may chose to interpret data using different equations (e.g. giving more weight to pledged stake). How the data is interpret is deemed out of the scope of this proposal which aims mainly at producing the data-points. Further conversations and debates will be needed regarding interpretation of the data-points.\n1 Lovelace = 1 Voice\nThis proposal does not introduce a change in the current governance scheme: it is still up to the three genesis entities to make a final call based on the poll results. Poll results will provide new data points to feed into the conversation. But, regardless of the outcome, any decision will be explained and motivated by other auditable sources of information. And on-chain polls will provide such an auditable source.\nThe proposed process will permanently record questions and their answers on-chain by leveraging existing transaction metadata. Note that we consciously do not record any element as datums. There are several reasons for this:\nThere have been several (on-and-off-the-record) discussions regarding using the cold key (Ed25519) vs the VRF key as authentication instruments; and arguments for both.\nOn the one hand, some prefer the use of the cold key because:\nOn the other hand, arguments for using the VRF key were already discussed as part of CIP-0022:\nWe originally opted for a hybrid solution (as visible in input-output-hk#5050) but later decided to drop the VRF option to rely solely on cold key signing (see input-output-hk#5132). The reason for that regards the possible uncertainty of promoting (ab)use of VRF proving in the cardano-cli on such a short time period (see also Insecurity of secret key re-usage).\nThis has the unfortunate effect of making this participation procedure harder for SPOs relying on cold storage but we are open to the idea of proxy-keys authenticated off-chain through a challenge similar to CIP-0022.\nThere's a third on-chain element which we could use for identifying SPOs which is a digital signature from their KES credentials. It is however a bit more annoying to leverage mainly because KES are meant to expire and are only loosely tied to pools by operational certificate. Thus, verifying KES signatures on a survey requires a more complex setup and monitoring to keep track of operational certificates and their validity at the time of the survey.\nIf this CIP was meant to NOT be an interim solution, this is something we would likely consider. However, given the timeframe we're looking at and the overall trade-offs in complexity, we have opted out of using the KES as an authentication mechanism in this iteration.\nAnother possible alternative to what's described in the CIP would be to have SPOs register a proxy Ed25519 key and use that proxy key onward. The validity of the proxy key registration would be conditionned to the production of an associated VRF proof or a digital signature from the cold key (very much like it's done for operational certificate).\nYet, like the KES alternative, this option is in conflict with some of the design goals of this CIP: simplicity. All the more so given that we want to maximise participation of SPOs to the various surveys. We aim to make the process of participating to the survey as simple as possible, without compromising on security.\nNote Both alternative options for KES Signing and Proxy Keys may be re-considered in a future version of the survey. Especially if the solution turns out to be not as temporary as intended. Fortunately, the current design decisions do not preclude this from happening as it shall be possible to introduce two new witness types 6 and 7 for those purpose. The KES registration can be handled through a separate on-chain event.\n6\n7\nQuestions are meant to be unique, achieved using an optional nonce. It is up to the genesis entity conducting the poll to ensure the formulated question is unique. If the same question is asked several times, the nonce provides non-replayable protection.\nThen, because every answer contains a (unique) hash of the question, answers are unique too. Yet, it still means that the same answer can be recast multiple times (possibly, by another system actor), so we do not allow answers to be changed/cast multiple times. The only exception is when answers are authenticated again using a cold key.\nExposure to SPOs' secret credentials must be limited, and their manipulation shall be done carefully. This potential attack vector is why we propose to extend the cardano-cli and have support for these features scrutinised by existing core maintainers and other open source actors.\ncardano-cli\nOther tools are then free to replicate the approach taken in the cardano-cli, but we recommend that SPOs proceed with extreme caution when using third-party tools. In particular, any tool should be able to work fully offline to produce the required metadata. Final transaction construction and submission shall be made in any suitable environment, yet the metadata's production shall be done only in air-gapped systems.\nProvide a reference implementation for the signing method\ncardano-cli\nPossibly add support for KES signing as an alternative to EdDSA from the cold key and the VRF proving.\ncncli\nCardanoScan\nAdaStat\ncardano-signer\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This document describes an interface between webpage/web-based stacks and Cardano wallets. This specification defines the API of the javascript object that needs to be injected into web applications.\nThese definitions extend CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge to provide support for CIP-1694 | A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance focussed web-based stacks. Here we aim to support the requirements of Ada holders and DReps in the Conway Ledger era, this specification is based on the Conway Ledger Era Specification.\nFor the many contributors to this proposal, see Acknowledgements.\nCIP-1694 introduces many new concepts, entities and actors to Cardano; describing their implementation at the ledger level. This creates the need for new tooling with respect to governance. For the average ecosystem participant, the details should be abstracted away, enabling them to leverage the new ledger features more effectively. This specification allows for creation of web-based tools for the utilization of CIP-1694's governance features.\nWhilst CIP-30 facilitated the launch of dApp development on Cardano, it's functionality is limited in scope. It was written well before the emergence of the Conway Ledger Era and thus lacks the required methods to support full user interaction. We believe that expecting existing CIP-30 implementors to upgrade implementations is unfeasible, thus we must extend it's functionality with this API.\nThis proposal enables Ada holders, and DReps to engage web-based tooling through wallets. Thus the primary stakeholders for this proposal are tool developers and wallet providers. Here we aim to outline all endpoints needed to be exposed to web based tools to support all the needs Ada holders and DReps to engage with CIP-1694's governance design.\nWe define the following section as an extension to the specification described within CIP-30. Although currently CIP-30 acts as the defacto Cardano dApp-wallet connector, this specification could be applied to similar standards.\nNote This specification will evolve as the proposed ledger governance model is finalized.\nFrom CIP-30's Data Types we inherit:\nA string representing an address in either bech32 format, or hex-encoded bytes. All return types containing Address must return the hex-encoded bytes format, but must accept either format for inputs.\nAddress\nA hex-encoded string of the corresponding bytes.\nA hex-encoded string representing CBOR corresponding to T defined via CDDL either inside of the Shelley Multi-asset binary spec or, if not present there, from the CIP-0008 signing spec. This representation was chosen when possible as it is consistent across the Cardano ecosystem and widely used by other tools, such as cardano-serialization-lib, which has support to encode every type in the binary spec as CBOR bytes.\nT\ntype DataSignature = {| signature: cbor<COSE_Sign1>, key: cbor<COSE_Key>, |};\ntype DataSignature = {| signature: cbor<COSE_Sign1>, key: cbor<COSE_Key>, |};\nAn extension is an object with a single field \"cip\" that describe a CIP number extending the API (as a plain integer, without padding).

Once more feedback is received, maturing this design, implementations can safely emerge, alongside this proposal's merger into the CIPs repository. Once merged only small necessary changes should be made, ideally in backwards compatible fashion.\nThis, in tandem with, maturing implementations should move this proposal to an active state where only small backwards compatible changes can be made. If any large changes are needed once active then a new proposal should be made to replace this one. This we believe aligns with the (new) extendibility design of CIP-0030.\nThis describes a potential flow of connection between CIP-95 compatible client application and wallet, then a subsequent login.\n.{wallet-name}.enable({extensions: [{ \"cip\": 95 }]})\ncardano\n.getRegisteredPubStakeKeys()\n.getPubDRepKey()\nlogin\nAssume a DRep Aggregator and Delegation specialized client app, that aggregates DRep metadata from DRep registration certificates and renders this metadata to show prospective delegators.

This is motivated by the necessity for users to be able to interact with the age of Voltaire promptly, by keeping the wallet's providers ask small we aim to reduce implementation time.\nThis design aims to make the tracking of a user's governance state an optional endeavour for wallet providers. This is achieved by placing the responsibility on clients to track a user's governance state, i.e. if a wallet user is a DRep, what DRep a wallet user has delegated to, etc.\nDespite only defining the minimal set of endpoints required, we do not wish to discourage the creation of subsequent CIPs with a wider range of governance functionality. Nor does this specification aim to discourage wallet providers from fully integrating governance features, side-stepping the necessity for this API (matching how staking is achieved).\nWeb-based stacks, with wallet connectivity, are a familiar place for users to be able to interact with Cardano. These tools lower the technical bar to engage with the ecosystem. Thus we believe encouraging further adoption of this approach is beneficial.\nThe primary alternative approach is for wallet providers to integrate this functionality fully inside of wallet software, matching how staking is often implemented. We deem this approach as preferable from a security standpoint, we would encourage wallet providers to pursue this. But we understand that this adds significant overhead to wallet designs, so we offer this API as an alternative.\nThis proposal only caters to two types of governance actor described in CIP-1694; Ada holders and DReps, this decision was three fold. Primarily, this is to allow these groups to utilize a web-based client to participate in Cardano's governance. These groups are likely less comfortable utilizing command-line interfaces than other groups, thus making alternatives from them is a priority. Secondly, the other types of actor (constitutional committee members and SPOs) are identified by different credentials than Ada holders and DReps, making their integration in this specification more complex. These alternative credentials are unlikely to be stored within standard wallet software which may interface with this API. Thirdly, Ada holders and DReps likely represent the majority of participants thus we aim to cast a wide net with this specification.\nIn this specification we have placed explicit boundaries on what should not be supported with .signTx(). Those being not witnessing stake pool or constitutional committee, certificates and not inspecting genesis key delegation or MIR certificates.\n.signTx()\nFrom speaking to CIP-30 implementors it seems reasonable that there does not exist implementations or motivation to support witnessing stake pool certificates via wallet web bridges. This is because stake pool operators much prefer the utility and security advantages not operating via light wallets. Due to the Lack of Specificity of CIP-30 we felt it necessary to explicitly state the lack of support in this extension.\nConstitutional committee certificates are not supported by this specification's .signTx() for two reasons. First, this specification is only focussed on the need's of Ada holders and DReps. Secondly, the credentials used by the constitutional committee, are a hot and cold key setup. Hot and cold keys are not suited for standard light wallets.\n.signTx()\nGenesis key delegation and move instantaneous reward certificates (see in Shelley spec) are not supported here because they have been deprecated in the Conway ledger era. Furthermore, due to the lack of accessibility (require access to genesis keys) for these certificates it is extremely unlikely any CIP-30 implementations supported these.\nThe endpoints specified here aim to maintain the role of the wallet as: sharing public keys, transaction inspecting, transaction signing and transaction submission.\nIn a previous design we had stipulated the precise information that must be shown to user by wallets at signature time. This was discussed during the wallets and tooling hackathon and consensus was reached that is not the place of these APIs to prescribe such details to wallets. Rather this specification should be describing the interface between web-based stacks and wallets and not telling wallets what UI elements should be used. It is in a wallet's best interest to always adequately inform the user, with varying levels of detail based on the wallet's discretion.\nBy not placing the burden of transaction construction onto the wallet, we move the application specific complexity from wallet implementations and onto applications. This has a number of benefits, primarily this should lower the bar for wallet adoption. But this also helps in the creation of iterative updates, all wallet implementers do not need to update if the format of these transactions is adjusted during development.\nHere we also benefit from imitating the existing flows which have been utilized by CIP-30 compliant systems. Reusing existing flows is beneficial for developer adoption as it enables straight forward code reuse.\nOne argument against this design is that, if wallets are required to be able to inspect and thus understand these application specific transactions then they may as well build the transaction. Ultimately, we have taken the design decision to leave transaction construction to the applications.\nWhilst CIP-30 facilitated the launch of dApp client development on Cardano, it's functionality is limited in scope. Although it does offer generic functions, these cannot satisfy the problem that this proposal tackles in a backwards compatible manner. Thus extending it's functionality is a necessity.\nThe CIP-30 specification has required amendments to add clarification to it's ambiguity. There is further ambiguity around what is and is not supported via .signTx(). The specification does not explicitly list the transaction artifacts wallets has to be able to inspect and witness. Whilst for most use cases this is likely fine and has served the community well. We forsee issues around large ledger upgrades which introduce new types of transaction fields and certificate. Without explicit mention of what is and is not supported deltas between expected and actual functionality become common and hazardous. This is why we choose to explicitly list those items that wallet have to support when complying with this API.\n.signTx()\nWith this specification we chose to extend CIP-30's functionalities. There would be two competing designs to this approach. One; move to have this specification included within CIP-30. Two; deploy this specification as it's own standalone web-bridge.\nIt would be undesirable to include this functionality within the base CIP-30 API because it would force all wallets supporting CIP-30 to support this API. This is undesirable because not all client apps or wallets will have the need or desire to support this specification.\nThe reason we chose to not deploy this specification on its own is because it is unlikely that clients implementing this API will not want to also use the functionality offered by CIP-30. Additionally, CIP-30 offers a extensibility mechanism meaning that the initial handshake connection is defined and thus wont be needed to be defined within this specification.\nFurthermore, another benefit of utilizing the CIP-30 extensibility mechanism is the potential for siloing of wallet capabilities between client apps. By having to request access to each extension wallets and users are able to silo which extensions they allow to each client application. An example of this could be only allowing the CIP-95 API with governance related applications and not decentralized extensions.\nThe primary issue with just using CIP-30 to inspect, sign and submit Conway transactions/certificates is that wallet implementations are likely incompatible. This is because such certificates/transactions were not part of the ledger design at time of original CIP-30 implementation. Furthermore, CIP-30 was written and implemented before voting credentials were defined and thus it would be impossible to provide signatures with this credential to votes, DRep registrations and DRep retirements.\nAlthough it is likely that some of the capabilities of this API can be achieved by existing CIP-30 implementations it is not certain how much. We would like to avoid the potential mismatching of capabilities between CIP-30 implementations, as this creates unpredictable wallet behavior for client applications. Such behavior was a primary motivator to introduce such an extendability mechanism to CIP-30.\nIn this specification we have chosen to explicitly namespace all endpoint except .signTx() where we omit the namespacing. By not namespacing .signTx() we intend to offer client apps an override of the CIP-30 .signTx(). We chose to do this because this .signTx() extends the CIP-30 functionality in a backwards compatible way. All other endpoints are namespaced to avoid possible collisions with other future extensions.\n.signTx()\n.signTx()\n.signTx()\n.signTx()\nIn this design we chose to extend the capabilities of CIP-30's .signTx() and .signData() rather than introducing new endpoints for signing and submission. This was a result of community discussion at the wallets and tooling hackathon, leading to a more straight forward design. Originally we had individual endpoints for sign and submitting of DRep registration, DRep retirement, votes, governance actions and vote delegations.\n.signTx()\n.signData()\nWhilst individual endpoints seem like a simpler solution they would likely introduce more complexities for wallet implementors. As constraining what transactions an endpoint would require additional validation complexities and error handling from wallets. For example; what should a wallet do if it is passed a DRep registration certificate via .signTx()? should it witness or reject and only witness with a dedicated DRep registration endpoint?\n.signTx()\nFurthermore individual restrictive endpoints limit how much can be done in a single transaction. These methods would not allow multiple certificates to be supplied at once. Thus client apps would be limited to a single governance artifact per transaction. This is limiting as it means users have to submit multiple transactions to achieve what is possible in one.\nBy providing updated CIP-30 endpoints we essentially use the CIP-95 extension object as a flag to signal to apps at connection time a wallet's compatibility with Conway leger era. This goes against how past ledger feature upgrades have rolled out. Rather in the past, existing CIP-30 implementors have just updated their implementations, we believe this to be an error prone approach. This undoubted introduces deltas between what a client application expects a wallet to be able to do and what it can do. There is no way for a client application to know what a wallet is capable of.\nDespite this we do not discourage CIP-30 implementors from updating their implementations to support Conway artifacts to .signData() and .signTx(). But if so they must support the CIP-95 object flag at connection time, so that clients are aware of this functionality.\n.signData()\n.signTx()\nAlthough multi-stake key wallets are not widely adopted across Cardano, we make an effort to support them here. This is because a single stake key can delegate to a single DRep. By allowing users to spread stake across multiple stake keys it allows different weighted delegation to different DReps, this could be a very desirable feature.\nThis specification does not cater for wallets who manage non-key-based stake credentials and those who wish to handle non-key-based DRep credentials. This does limit the usefulness of this specification. But the complexities that would be introduced by generalization this specification to these credentials is unlikely to yield much benefit since these types of wallet are not prevalent in Cardano.\nAlthough this means that we are likely excluding tooling for DAOs from being supported through this standard. The argument could be made that such entities generally prefer to use more advanced wallet tooling rather than relying on interaction with web-based stacks, thus it is not even certain DAOs would want to use such a standard.\nUnlike the CIP-30 specification we have made an decision, where possible to represent keys as raw hex rather than encoded representations. We believe that it is not the role of the wallet to encode such credentials, encoding needs should be at the application's discretion. Introducing different encodings into this API would add unneeded complexity.\nFurthermore, in this API we chose to return public keys over key-hashes or addresses. Again we believe wallets should just serve public key information and it is up to the application to encode and derive addresses as needed. This simplifies the overall design and makes implementations easier for wallets.\nFor stake keys we have chosen to implement two endpoints where wallets can share registered and unregistered stake keys. Originally we had a single endpoint which only allowed sharing of registered stake keys. This was problematic for wallets which had no registered stake keys, and thus the second endpoint was introduced.\nWe chose to keep a single endpoint for DRep keys, although it would have been possible to introduce a second to allow for wallets to activity of their DRep keys. This was just for the simplicity of the API. Furthermore, due to the design of this proposal it is unlikely that wallets will implement methods to track a user's DRep state.\nThis proposal should not effect the backwards compatibility of either clients or wallet implementors.\nCIP-62? | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge Catalyst Extension is another extension to the CIP-30 API, this proposal is independent of CIP-95. The CIP-95 specification does not rely on any of the implementation defined in CIP-62?. We have attempted to avoid any collisions of naming between these proposals, this was motivated by a desire to make wallet implementations more straight forward for wallets implementing both APIs.\n.getRewardAddresses()\nwallets-sanchonet\nOn 2023.07.13 a online and in person community hackathon took place, aims of this event included maturation of the design of this specification.\nWe would like to thank the following attendees for providing their valuable insights:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "Since at least 2021 when Cardano entered the Mary Era and implemented Native Assets, projects and creators building on the network have sought a means to distribute their tokens efficiently to users. Of particular frustration has been the ability to onboard new users at real-world events. Solutions for this historically have been to create and preload \"paper wallets\" where a seed phrase and accompanying password is generated by the project, pre-populated with tokens and ADA, and then delivered over to attendees of said event.\nThe creation of this addendum to the CIP-13 Cardano URI scheme seeks to minimize this friction and take advantage of existing technology to enable a new era of user onboarding, particularly at real world events through the use of a defined URI scheme enabling instant and frictionless communication between a project's \"token fountain\" and the user's wallet to reward, incentivize, and onboard new users easier than ever.\nThis CIP defines an extension to the CIP-13 URI Scheme as well as an API specification to facilitate and streamline communications between wallets and project servers.\nBy leveraging the power of Cardano-specific URIs (CIP-13) and the modern technological advances of mobile devices and wallets we can provide a framework for Cardano projects to attend real world events, incentivize or reward attendees via their Native Assets, and have facts and figures to help support and analyze the impact that their attendance had (Proof of Onboarding).\nDistributing Native Assets (and/or ADA) to attendees of IRL events has historically been a pain point in the ecosystem. Some implemented solutions have included: Pre-generating wallet seed phrases and pre-populating these wallets with a minimum amount of ADA as well as the desired Native Assets, (re)creating token fountain/faucet designs which can be cumbersome and not user-friendly to instruct individuals to install a wallet, visit a website, enter a code and claim tokens.\nThe Cardano Token Claim URI schema is proposed to allow wallets (particularly mobile wallets) to implement a QR-friendly URI structure allowing for easy onboarding and distribution of Native Assets and/or ADA to individuals in a variety of situations but not least of which being at IRL events specifically tailored and geared to onboarding new users to the ecosystem.\nExamples:\n<!-- Token Claim URIs --> <a href=\"web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.hosky.io&code=consensus2023\">Claim $HOSKY</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.hosky.io%2Fconsensus23&code=ABC123\">Claim $HOSKY</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.nftxlv.com&code=ABC123&invoice=123456\">Claim NFTxLV Commermorative NFT!</a>\n<!-- Token Claim URIs --> <a href=\"web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.hosky.io&code=consensus2023\">Claim $HOSKY</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.hosky.io%2Fconsensus23&code=ABC123\">Claim $HOSKY</a> <a href=\"web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.nftxlv.com&code=ABC123&invoice=123456\">Claim NFTxLV Commermorative NFT!</a>\nclaim\nfaucet_url\ncode\nfaucet_url\ncardanourn = \"web+cardano:\" claimtokenref claimtokenref = \"//claim\" claimversion claimquery claimversion = \"/v1\" claimquery = ( \"?\" claimurl) ( \"&\" claimcode) claimurl = \"faucet_url=\" text claimcode = \"code=\" text\ncardanourn = \"web+cardano:\" claimtokenref claimtokenref = \"//claim\" claimversion claimquery claimversion = \"/v1\" claimquery = ( \"?\" claimurl) ( \"&\" claimcode) claimurl = \"faucet_url=\" text claimcode = \"code=\" text\nAll arguments for Token Claim URIs should be URL-encoded\nVersion 1 URIs\nVersion 1 URIs must include a faucet_url and a code as required parameters.\nfaucet_url\ncode\nURIs may include additional arguments to suit the needs of the project's faucet API.\nThe token claim URI should consist of a required versioning path (i.e. /v1) as well as one or more required or optional URL-encoded arguments.\npath\n/v1\nAll Token Claim URIs must include a URL-encoded faucet_url argument as well as a code argument.\nfaucet_url\ncode\nThe wallet provider should send a POST request to the provided Faucet URL that includes:\nFaucet URL\nExample:\nURI: web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.hosky.io%2Fconsensus23&code=ABC123 Version: 1 URL: https://claim.hosky.io/consensus23 CODE: ABC123 JSON POST Data:\nURI: web+cardano://claim/v1?faucet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaim.hosky.io%2Fconsensus23&code=ABC123 Version: 1 URL: https://claim.hosky.io/consensus23 CODE: ABC123 JSON POST Data:\n{ \"address\": \"addr1abc...xyz\", \"code\": \"ABC123\" }\n{ \"address\": \"addr1abc...xyz\", \"code\": \"ABC123\" }\naddress\nThe wallet should always send the recipient address in bech32 format.

    "prompt": "CIP0100?",
    "completion": "This Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) introduces a standardized and flexible metadata format for governance events in the Cardano ecosystem. While the ledger does not enforce the structure of metadata, providing a standard for metadata will enable better tooling, improved interoperability, and more consistent display across wallets, blockchain explorers, and other tools. This CIP aims to strike a balance between flexibility and structure to facilitate high-quality tooling, without limiting expressivity with regards to user expression.\nFor the many contributors to this proposal, see Acknowledgements.\nWith the advent of the Voltaire era, Cardano is moving towards a decentralized governance model. CIP-1694 addresses a potential technical implementation of ledger rules for creating, voting on, and ratifying proposed changes to the ledger. The ledger has no mechanism or desire to validate this metadata, and as a result, the official specification leaves the format of this metadata unspecified.\nTo facilitate rich user experiences for the various governance actors, however, it would be beneficial to have a suggested universal format for this metadata, allowing deep and interconnected discovery and exploration of this metadata. This CIP seeks to provide that standard format, and a minimal set of fields for various governance actions, leaving the true depth of metadata to be defined later through the extensibility mechanism outlined below.\nWhile this specification is written with CIP-1694 in mind, many of the ideas should be equally suitable for any other governance proposal, provided that proposal has a mechanism for attaching metadata to a governance action.\nExplicitly, here are the goals this CIP is trying to satisfy:\nThis section outlines the high level format and requirements of this standard.\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).\n@context\n@type\nhashAlgorithm\nJSON-LD is a standard for describing interconnected JSON documents that use a shared vocabulary.\nIn a JSON-LD document, every field is uniquely tied to some globally unique identifier by means of an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI). Different machine-consumers can then know that they agree on the interpretation of these fields.\nThe shared vocabulary of fields is standardized within the scope of a document via a @context field. This allows a compositional / extensible approach to versioning, similar to the recent changes to CIP-0030. Rather than specifying a version number and forcing competing standards to compete for what the \"next\" version number will include, instead a wide variety of standards are allowed and encouraged. Tool authors MAY support those which are the most beneficial or common. This creates an organic, collaborative evolution of the standard.\n@context\nNote: Any URI's in the @context field SHOULD be content-addressable and robustly hosted; losing access to the schema is less dangerous than losing access to the metadata itself, but should still prefer strong and immutable storage options for the preservation of context.\n@context\n@type\n@context\n@context\n@context\n@context\nExtensions to the governance metadata standard can take one of two forms:\nIn CIP-1694 (and likely any alternative or future evolution of it), there are a number of certificates that can be attached to a transaction pertaining to governance; each of these is equipped with an \"anchor\", which is a URI at which can be found additional metadata.\nWhile this metadata can be published anywhere, external hosting may be unavailable to some users. Therefore, we recognize the transaction metadata as an effective tool for a \"common town square\" for hosting and discoverability, and reserve metadatum label 1694 for publishing governance related metadata on-chain.\nWith the help of CIP-?, the anchor can then refer to the metadata of another transaction, or even the metadata of the transaction being published itself.\nWhen published on-chain, the CBOR encoding of this metadata, when published on-chain, follows the standard convention used for converting JSON to CBOR in transaction metadata.\nAdditionally, someone may wish to augment a previous piece of metadata with new information, divorced from the transaction that initially published it; this may be useful, for example, provide additional arguments in favor of or against a proposal, provide translations to other languages, provide a layman's explanation of a highly technical document, etc.\nThese use the same format, but leverage the references field to point to the documents that they wish to extend.\nreferences\nThese can, in theory, be published anywhere, but the use of metadatum label 1694 mentioned above is particularly useful in this case.\nWe expect a rich ecosystem of CIPs to emerge defining different extensions, so this CIP provides only an initial base-line MVP of fields, defined in the following JSON-LD and JSON Schema files:\nThe rest of this document will provide a high level description of how these fields should be interpreted\nThe following properties are considered common to all types of transactions, and the minimal set needed for \"minimum viable governance\":\nhashAlgorithm\nauthors\nname\nwitness\nbody\n@context\nbody\nreferences\n@type\nlabel\nuri\ncomment\nexternalUpdates\n@context\ntitle\nuri\nAdditionally, we highlight the following concepts native to json-ld that are useful in the context of governance metadata:\n@context\n@language\n@context\n@container\n@language\nWhen publishing a governance action, the certificate has an \"anchor\", defined as a URI and a hash of the content at the URI.\nFor CIP-0100 compliant metadata, the hash in the anchor should be the blake2b-256 hash of the raw bytes received from the wire. Hashing directly the original bytes ensures that there are no ambiguities, since the process doesn't depend on parsing the metadata, which can be the source of conflicts in different implementations.\nA metadata has a number of authors, each of which MUST authenticate their endorsement of the document in some way.\nThis is left extensible, through the use of a new context, but for the purposes of this CIP, we provide a simple scheme.\nEach author should have a witness. The witness will be an object with an witnessAlgorithm (set to ed25519), a publicKey (set to a base-16 encoded ed25519 public key), and a signature, set to the base-16 encoded signature of the body field.\nwitnessAlgorithm\npublicKey\nsignature\nBecause the overall document may change, it is neccesary to hash a subset of the document that is known before any signatures are collected. This is the motivation behind the body field.\nbody\nThe signature is an ed25519 signature using the attached public key, and the payload set to the blake2b-256 hash of the body field. Specifically, this field is canonicalized in the following way.\nbody\nbody\nThis section outlines a number of other best practices for tools and user experiences built on top of this standard, as brainstormed by the Cardano community.\nHere are the goals this CIP seeks to achieve, and the rationale for how this specific solution accomplishes them:\n@context\nThe following alternatives were considered, and rejected:\nextensions\n@context\nSee test-vector.md for example.\nThe path for this proposal to be considered active within the community focuses on 4 key stages: Feedback, Implementation, Adoption, and Extension.\nIn order for this standard to be active, the following should be true:\nBelow you can find a growing list of community tools which let you sign / verify / canonize / manipulate governance metadata JSON-LD data:\nThe key stages to get this proposal to active, and the motivation for why each stage is valuable, is outlined below:\nI would like to thank those that contributed to this first draft during the online workshop that was held on 2023-04-12.\nThe following people helped with the second draft, out of band at at the Edinburgh workshop on 2023-07-12.\nThe following people helped with the third draft during the online workshop held on 2023-11-02.\nThe following people helped with the third draft during the online workshop held on 2023-11-10.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

However, full compatibility is still impossible due to the absence of the keccak256 hashing algorithm in Plutus interpreter, which is a fundamental component of Ethereum's cryptographic framework:\nkeccak256\nkeccak256\nkeccak256\nAdding keccak256 to Plutus would enhance the potential for cross-chain solutions between Cardano and EVM-based blockchains.\nkeccak256\nA compelling integration that would greatly benefit from keccak256 support on the Cardano blockchain is Hyperlane. Hyperlane is a permissionless interoperability layer that facilitates communication of arbitrary data between smart contracts across multiple blockchains. Hyperlane's interchain security modules rely on the verification of specific cryptographic proofs from one chain to another. These proofs utilize the keccak256 hash to calculate consistent cross-chain message IDs. The multi-signature module verifies that a majority of off-chain validators have signed an ECDSA signature over a keccak256 digest, a common practice in EVM.\nkeccak256\nkeccak256\nkeccak256\nWhile Hyperlane can support different cryptographic primitives for non-EVM chains, doing so could compromise censorship resistance, resulting in only limited support for Cardano in Hyperlane. By implementing this CIP, Cardano could fully integrate with Hyperlane's security modules, enabling Cardano smart contracts to communicate with any blockchain supported by Hyperlane.\nThis proposal aims to introduce a new built-in hash function keccak_256.\nkeccak_256\nThis function will be developed following the keccak256 specification and will utilize the cryptonite implementation. Since cryptonite is already a part of the cardano-base, this simplifies its integration into Plutus. The cost of the keccak_256 operation will scale linearly with the length of the message.\nkeccak256\ncryptonite\ncardano-base\nkeccak_256\nMore specifically, Plutus will gain the following primitive operation:\nkeccak_256\nThe input to this function can be a ByteString of arbitrary size, and the output will be a ByteString of 32 bytes. Note that this function aligns with the format of existing hash functions in Plutus, such as blake2b_256\nByteString\nByteString\nWhile the keccak256 function might be implemented in on-chain scripts, doing so would be computationally unfeasible.\nkeccak256\nThe library, cryptonite, is not implemented by and under control of the Plutus team. However,\nThis CIP may transition to active status once the Plutus version containing the keccak_256 function is introduced in a node release and becomes available on Mainnet.\nkeccak_256\nkeccak256\nThe Plutus team will develop the binding, integration tests, and benchmarks. The E2E tests will be designed and implemented collaboratively by the testing team, the Plutus team, and community members planning to use this primitive.\nThis CIP is licensed under [Apache-2.0][https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0].\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

Future versions of this standard could also easily support multiple royalty policies defined for a single collection, applied at the level of individual tokens.\nThe following defines the 500 Royalty NFT standard with the registered asset_name_label prefix value\n500\nasset_name_label\nThe royalty NFT is an NFT (non-fungible token).\nroyalty NFT\nThe royalty NFT must have an identical policy id as the collection.\nroyalty NFT\npolicy id\nThe asset name must be 001f4d70526f79616c7479 (hex encoded), it contains the CIP-0067 label 500 followed by the word \"Royalty\".\nasset name\n001f4d70526f79616c7479\n500\nExample: royalty NFT: (500)Royalty reference NFT: (100)Test123\nroyalty NFT\n(500)Royalty\nreference NFT\n(100)Test123\nThe royalty info datum is specified as follows (CDDL):\nbig_int = int / big_uint / big_nint big_uint = #6.2(bounded_bytes) big_nint = #6.3(bounded_bytes) optional_big_int = #6.121([big_int]) / #6.122([]) royalty_recipient = #6.121([ address, ; definition can be derived from: ; https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-ledger-api/src/PlutusLedgerApi/V1/Address.hs#L31 int, ; variable fee ( calculation: ⌊1 / (fee / 10)⌋ ); integer division with precision 10 optional_big_int, ; min fee (absolute value in lovelace) optional_big_int, ; max fee (absolute value in lovelace) ]) royalty_recipients = [ * royalty_recipient ] ; version is of type int, we start with version 1 version = 1 ; Custom user defined plutus data. ; Setting data is optional, but the field is required ; and needs to be at least Unit/Void: #6.121([]) extra = plutus_data royalty_info = #6.121([royalty_recipients, version, extra])\nbig_int = int / big_uint / big_nint big_uint = #6.2(bounded_bytes) big_nint = #6.3(bounded_bytes) optional_big_int = #6.121([big_int]) / #6.122([]) royalty_recipient = #6.121([ address, ; definition can be derived from: ; https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-ledger-api/src/PlutusLedgerApi/V1/Address.hs#L31 int, ; variable fee ( calculation: ⌊1 / (fee / 10)⌋ ); integer division with precision 10 optional_big_int, ; min fee (absolute value in lovelace) optional_big_int, ; max fee (absolute value in lovelace) ]) royalty_recipients = [ * royalty_recipient ] ; version is of type int, we start with version 1 version = 1 ; Custom user defined plutus data. ; Setting data is optional, but the field is required ; and needs to be at least Unit/Void: #6.121([]) extra = plutus_data royalty_info = #6.121([royalty_recipients, version, extra])\n; Given a royalty fee of 1.6% (0.016) ; To store this in the royalty datum 1 / (0.016 / 10) => 625 ; To read it back 10 / 625 => 0.016\n; Given a royalty fee of 1.6% (0.016) ; To store this in the royalty datum 1 / (0.016 / 10) => 625 ; To read it back 10 / 625 => 0.016\nBecause the computational complexity of Plutus primitives scales with size, this approach significantly minimizes resource consumption.\nTo prevent abuse, it is recommended that the royalty NFT is stored at the script address of a validator that ensures the specified fees are not arbitrarily changed, such as an always-fails validator.\nroyalty NFT\nIf not specified elsewhere in the token's datums, a malicious user could send transactions to a protocol which do not reference the royalty datum. For full assurances, a new optional flag should be added to the reference datum\nextra = { ... ? royalty_included : big_int }\nextra = { ... ? royalty_included : big_int }\nIn-code examples can be found in the reference implementation.\nA third party has the following NFT d5e6bf0500378d4f0da4e8dde6becec7621cd8cbf5cbb9b87013d4cc.(222)TestToken and they want to look up the royalties.

This is done with expediency in mind and the expectation that additional changes to the specification may be made in the future. The sooner we have a standard established, the sooner we can make use of it. Rather than attempting to anticipate all use cases, we specify with forward-compatibility in mind.\nThis specification is largely based on the royalty specification in Nebula, with a couple key departures:\nThe royalty token is recommended to be locked at a script address, rather than stored in the user's wallet. This encourages projects to guarantee royalties won't change by sending their royalties to an always-fails (or similar) script address, but still allows for creative royalty schemes and minimizes disruption to existing projects.\nThe policyId of the royalty NFT must match that of the reference NFT. This enables lookups based on the user token in the same way as is done for the tokens specified in the original CIP-68 standard.\nIn addition to providing a way to create guaranteed royalties, this has several advantages:\nTo keep metadata compatibility with changes coming in the future, we introduce a version field in the datum.\nversion\nSee the CIP-0068 Extension Boilerplate\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

Instead a TxSignError is to be thrown. The error message thrown should include a reference to the transaction that caused the sign error, by including the index for failing transaction that map to the input array transaction list.\nTxSignError\nThere are certain things that should be considered by wallets implementing this CIP, namely user visibility of what is signed. Though not explicitly specified in this CIP, as it would be up to the wallet to find a good solution, the wallet should make it clear to the user that multiple transactions are to be signed, and to give a clear overview/summary of what is signed. In addition to visibility, the wallet shall process the input transaction array in the same order as input parameter to allow transactions to be chained by accepting a previous transaction in the array to be used as input in a following transaction.\napi.cip103.submitTxs(txs: cbor<transaction>[]): Promise<hash32[]>\nErrors: APIError, TxSendError\nAPIError\nTxSendError\nExtends CIP-30 (Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge) submitTx with the ability to submit transactions in bulk.

If all transactions are successfully submitted, an array of transaction ids is to be returned. In the case of one or multiple Refused | Failure, a TxSendError | hash32 array is thrown. Each entry in the array represents either a successful submit with hash32 (transaction id), or in the case of Refused | Failure, a TxSendError object. In both cases, the response array directly corresponds to the elements in the txs parameter.\nRefused | Failure\nTxSendError | hash32\nhash32\nRefused | Failure\nTxSendError\ntxs\nOnce approved and final, the proposal must be superseded by another if changes break the specification. Minor adjustments are allowed if needed to improve readability and resolve uncertainties.\nAllowing for bulk signing and submission of transactions can greatly improve the user experience by reducing the amount of steps needed to sign more than one transaction. Allowing multiple transactions to be provided in the same API call also reduces the burden for transaction chaining that was previously mainly possible by keeping track of node mempool to know if input utxo's are available to be spent. Submitting multiple transactions would still be possible without submitTxs addition using the already defined CIP-30 (Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge) submitTx endpoint by calling it multiple times. However, allowing a bulk submit endpoint speeds up submission when many transactions are to be submitted at once as you wouldn't have to await each individual submission.\nsubmitTxs\nIn order for this standard to be active, the following should be true:\nN/A\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "The Conway Ledger era introduces many new features to Cardano, notably features to support community governance via CIP-1694. This includes the introduction of the new first class credentials; drep_credential, committee_cold_credential and committee_hot_credential.\ndrep_credential\ncommittee_cold_credential\ncommittee_hot_credential\nWe propose a HD wallet key derivation paths for registered DReps and constitutional committee members to deterministically derive keys from which credentials can be generated. Such keys are to be known as DRep keys, constitutional committee cold keys and constitutional committee hot keys. Here we define some accompanying tooling standards.\nNote this proposal assumes knowledge of the Conway ledger design (see draft ledger specification) and CIP-1694.\nIn the Conway ledger era, DRep credentials allow registered DReps to be identified on-chain, in DRep registrations, retirements, votes, and in vote delegations from ada holders. Whilst constitutional committee members can be recognized by their cold credentials within update committee governance actions, authorize hot credential certificate and resign cold key certificates. Constitutional committee hot credential can be observed within the authorize hot key certificate and votes.\nCIP-1694 terms these DRep credentials as DRep IDs, which are either generated from blake2b-224 hash digests of Ed25519 public keys owned by the DRep, or are script hash-based. Similarly, both the hot and cold credentials for constitutional committee members can be generated from public key digests or script hashes.\nThis CIP defines a standard way for wallets to derive DRep and constitutional committee keys.\nSince it is best practice to use a single cryptographic key for a single purpose, we opt to keep DRep and committee keys separate from other keys in Cardano.\nBy adding three paths to the CIP-1852 | HD (Hierarchy for Deterministic) Wallets for Cardano, we create an ecosystem standard for wallets to be able to derive DRep and constitutional committee keys. This enables DRep and constitutional committee credential restorability from a wallet seed phrase.\nStakeholders for this proposal are wallets that follow the CIP-1852 standard and tool makers wishing to support DReps and or constitutional committee members. This standard allows DReps and constitutional committee members to use alternative wallets whilst being able to be correctly identified. By defining tooling standards, we enable greater interoperability between governance-focussed tools.\nHere we describe DRep key derivation as it pertains to Cardano wallets that follow the CIP-1852 standard.\nTo differentiate DRep keys from other Cardano keys, we define a new role index of 3:\nrole\n3\nm / 1852' / 1815' / account' / 3 / address_index\nm / 1852' / 1815' / account' / 3 / address_index\nWe strongly recommend that a maximum of one set of DRep keys should be associated with one wallet account, which can be achieved by setting address_index=0.\naddress_index=0\nTools and wallets can generate a DRep ID (drep_credential) from the Ed25519 public DRep key (without chaincode) by creating a blake2b-224 hash digest of the key.

Tools implementing this standard are encouraged to consider adopting CIP-0129. Tools that already support CIP-0129 maintain backward compatibility with the legacy formats specified below but should consider fully transitioning to CIP-0129 to standardize key formats across the ecosystem. This will help avoid multiple formats and ensure consistency.\nThis CIP previously also lacked _vkh key definitions, which are now added above possible due to the upgrades defined in CIP-0129. For detailed information on the new specification and the rationale behind the upgrade, please refer to CIP-0129.\n_vkh\ndrep\ndrep_script\ncc_cold\ncc_cold_script\ncc_hot\ncc_hot_script\nThis CIP is not to be versioned using a traditional scheme, rather if any large technical changes are required then a new proposal must replace this one. Small changes can be made if they are completely backwards compatible with implementations, but this should be avoided.\nBy standardizing derivation, naming, and tooling conventions we primarily aim to enable wallet interoperability. By having a standard to generate DRep and constitutional committee credentials from mnemonics, we allow wallets to always be able to discover a user s governance activities.\nThis approach mirrors how stake keys were rolled out, see CIP-0011 | Staking key chain for HD wallets. We deem this necessary since these credentials sit alongside each other in the Conway ledger design.\nThe alternative would be to define a completely different derivation paths, using a different index in the purpose field, similar to the specification outlined within CIP-0036, but this could introduce complications with HW wallet implementations.\nWe believe the overhead that would be introduced by multi-DRep accounts or multi-constitutional-committee is an unjustified expense. Future iterations of this specification may expand on this, but at present this is seen as unnecessary. This avoids the need for DRep, cc hot or cc cold key discovery.\nWe model this on how stake keys are generally handled by wallets. If required, another CIP could, of course, introduce a multi-DRep/CC method.\nFor simplicity, we have omitted network tags within the encoding. This is because we have modeled DRep IDs and CC credentials on stake pool operator IDs, which similarly do not include a network tag.\nThe advantage of including a network tag would be to reduce the likelihood of mislabelling a DRep s network of operation (eg Preview v Cardano mainnet).\nSee Test Vectors File.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

This should only be used when this is not critical, or for blocks outside of the rollback horizon.\nblockref = \"//block\" query query = ( \"?block=\" block_hash | \"?height=\" block_height) block_hash = 64HEXDIG block_height = *digit\nblockref = \"//block\" query query = ( \"?block=\" block_hash | \"?height=\" block_height) block_hash = 64HEXDIG block_height = *digit\nA link referencing this transaction, another transaction, transaction output, the full transaction metadata, or specific tag within the transaction metadata.\ntransactionref = \"//transaction/\" (tx_id | utxo_id | tx_metadata | tx_metadata_tag) tx_id = \"self\" | 64HEXDIG utxo_id = tx_id \"#\" *digit tx_metadata = tx_id \"/\" metadata tx_metadata_tag = tx_id \"/\" metadata \"/\" *digit\ntransactionref = \"//transaction/\" (tx_id | utxo_id | tx_metadata | tx_metadata_tag) tx_id = \"self\" | 64HEXDIG utxo_id = tx_id \"#\" *digit tx_metadata = tx_id \"/\" metadata tx_metadata_tag = tx_id \"/\" metadata \"/\" *digit\nNOTE: tx_id can be set to \"self\", which is useful for making self-referential metadata, before the transaction ID is known. For example, in CIP-100, you may want to store governance metadata on the transaction which casts the vote. The transaciton hash is not yet known, and so the anchor field cannot link to the transaction by transaction ID.\nanchor\nFor grammar reference, see:\nThis CIP defines a canonical format for URIs referencing four new Cardano objects: blocks, transactions, transaction metadata, and specific tags within the transaction metadata. It utilizes existing cardano standards (CIP-0013) and industry standards (URIs), minimizing the number of new concepts that a developer needs to learn. By utilizing URIs, it creates a natural path to integration with existing tools, such as browsers. And finally, it allows a canonical URI for these objects, such as storing CIP-100 metadata on-chain, and referring to it in the anchor field.\nThe current community sentiment towards adopting this in CIP-100 is high (it was the original inspiration).\nAdvocacy and education about this format should be performed by:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "The Conway ledger era ushers in on-chain governance for Cardano via CIP-1694 | A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance, with the addition of many new on-chain governance artifacts. Some of these artifacts support the linking off-chain metadata, as a way to provide context.\nThe CIP-100 | Governance Metadata standard provides a base framework for how all off-chain governance metadata should be formed and handled. But this is intentionally limited in scope, so that it can be expanded upon by more specific subsequent CIPs.\nThis proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to governance actions. Without a sufficiently detailed standard for governance actions we introduce the possibility to undermine voters ability to adequately assess governance actions. Furthermore a lack of such standards risks preventing interoperability between tools, to the detriment of user experiences.\nFor the many contributors to this proposal, see Acknowledgements.\nBlockchains are poor choices to act as content databases. This is why governance metadata anchors were chosen to provide a way to attach long form metadata content to on-chain events. By only supplying an onchain hash of the off-chain we ensure correctness of data whilst minimizing the amount of data posted to the chain.\nWhen observing from the chain level, tooling can only see the content of the governance action and it's anchor. These on-chain components do not give give any context to the motivation nor off-chain discussion of an governance action. Although this information would likely be desired context for voters. By providing rich contextual metadata we enable voters to make well informed decisions.\nBy standardizing off-chain metadata formats we facilitate interoperability for tooling which creates and/or renders metadata attached to governance actions. This intern promotes a rich user experience between tooling. This is good for all governance participants.\nAlthough there are seven types of governance action defined via CIP-1694, we focus this proposal on defining core properties which must be attached to all types. We leave room for future standards to refine and specialize further to cater more specific for each type of governance action.\nwitness\nHere we extend the potential witnesses, with a witnessAlgorithm that can be set to include support for CIP-08 | Message Signing standard, indicated by CIP-0008. Here we mimic the restrictions as imposed over the CIP-30's implementation in .signData().\nwitnessAlgorithm\nCIP-0008\nThis standard introduces the possibility of using Github markdown text styling within fields.\nThe following properties extend the potential vocabulary of CIP-100's body property.\nbody\ntitle\n80\n100,000\nabstract\n2500\ntitle\nmotivation\nrationale\nmotivation\nreferences\n@set\nlabel\nuri\nreferenceHash\nhashDigest\nhashAlgorithm\nGovernance action metadata must include all compulsory fields to be considered CIP-0108 compliant. As this is an extension to CIP-100, all CIP-100 fields can be included within CIP-108 compliant metadata.\nSee test-vector.md for examples.\nThis proposal should not be versioned, to update this standard a new CIP should be proposed. Although through the JSON-LD mechanism further CIPs can add to the common governance metadata vocabulary,\nWe intentionally have kept this proposal brief and uncomplicated. This was to reduce the time to develop and deploy this standard. We think it is better to have a base standard which can be improved, rather than meticulously craft a perfect single standard. This way we enable tooling which depends on this standard to start development. Furthermore, it is very difficult to predict future wants/needs now, so by allowing upgrades we build in the ability to improve the standard as new wants/needs arrive.\nThe fields which have been chosen for this standard heavily inspired to those used for CIPs. We did this for two reasons; familiarity and competency. Those who are involved in Cardano are familiar with the CIP format, meaning they will be intuitively understand these fields being reused here. These fields in combination have also been fairly battle tested via the CIPs process and thus act as a good standard to describe problems and their solutions.\nwitness\nWe introduce a new witness type to be able to reuse existing dApp-Wallet infrastructure. The type as described allows for reuse of the CIP-30 signData standard, which means that governance dApps are able to implement this without needing any alterations to existing wallets.\nWe choose to introduce rich text standard here because we see significant value in supporting it. Rich text styling improves the ability for the author to express themselves. Furthermore, most potential voters are use to such standards when reviewing metadata.\nWith this design, we wanted to allow for quick and easy differentiation between governance actions. We achieve this by facilitating users \"layers of investigation\", where some fields are limited in size. This encourages tooling providers to show users the small fields before allowing deep investigation of the larger fields. By allowing this we aim to improve the experience of prospective voters, when sorting though many governance actions.\nThe downside of highlighting some fields over others is that we incentivize hyperbolic and eye catching phrases. Where authors want their governance action to standout in tooling so use overly dramatic phrasing. This creates an environment where there is a race to the bottom on voter's attention. Overall this could decrease the perceived legitimacy of the system. The counter argument is that tooling providers should not use metadata to solely highlight proposals, rather other means such as cryptographically verified submitters.\ntitle\nThis should be used by voters to quickly and easily differentiate between two governance actions which may be having the same or similar on-chain effects. This is why we have chosen a short character limit, as longer titles would reduce the ability for quick reading.\nabstract\nThis gives voters one step more detail beyond the title. This allows for a compact description of the what, why and how without the voter having to read the larger fields.\ntitle\nmotivation\nThe motivation is a chance for the author to fully describe the problem that is being solved by the governance action. This is important as all governance actions are a solution to a problem and thus this is a universal field. By showing relation to stakeholders the author is able to show that they have performed adequate research on the problem. Voters can use this field to determine if the problem is sizable enough to warrant voting on.\nmotivation\nrationale\nThis field gives the author the opportunity to explain how the onchain action is addressing the problem outlined in the motivation. This gives the author a place to discuss any alternative designs or completing governance actions. Voters should be able to use this field to evaluate the applicability of the solution to the problem.\nreferences\nReferences give the author ability to point to supporting research or related work. These should be used by voters to verify the content of supporting research. The inclusion of a hash allows for the supporting documentation to be cryptographically verified.\nThis standard is supported by two different tooling providers used to submit governance actions to chain.\nThis standard is supported by two different chain indexing tools, used to read and render metadata.\nSolicitation of feedback\nI would like to thank those that contributed to the Governance Metadata Working Group Workshop #1 hosted by Ryan Williams (see presentation slides with notes).\nThank you to the co-hosts:\nThank you to the participants:\nI would like to thank those that contributed to the Governance Metadata Working Group Workshop #2 hosted by Ryan Williams (see presentation slides with notes).\nThank you to the co-host:\nThank you to the participants:\nThank you to the bots that joined also.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This CIP proposes an extension of the current plutus functions to provide support for the efficient calculation of modular exponentiation with inverses.\nModular exponentiation is a cornerstone operation in numerous cryptographic protocols. The availability of such a function directly within Plutus will provide a more efficient and reliable means to perform this crucial computation. Therefore, the integration of such a Plutus core built-in is imperative to enhance cryptographic functionalities within the ecosystem.\nMore concretely, the key area where this function would contribute is that of finite field arithmetic, which is a basis for elliptic curves. In this context, a finite field is a set of integers modulo a prime number p. On this set, we have the basic operations of addition, multiplication, additive inversion (negation) and the multiplicative inversion (reciprocal), all reduced modulo the prime number p.\np\np\nWith the current built-in functions, most of these operations can be implemented relatively cheaply, except the reciprocal. This function can be implemented via either the Extended Euclidean algorithm or using Fermat's little theorem. Using the preliminary cost-model for plutus V3, both implementations still consume around ~5 and ~9 of the CPU budget on mainnet. These benchmarks are performed for the scalar field of the BLS12-381 curve, which has a 255 bit prime modulus.\nThe result is that doing such computation in a practical setting on-chain is costly, and other methods should be used to find this multiplicative inverse. A cumbersome method for solving this issue, is calculating the inverse off-chain and bringing it in scope via a redeemer as a claimed inverse of another element. This method works, as one can cheaply check that the claimed inverse is indeed the unique inverse with one multiplication, one modulo reduction and one equality check with the multiplicative identity. In math notation this means that for a field element a, we off-chain compute claimed_inverse_a, such that on-chain we can check: claimed_inverse_a * a = id.\na\nclaimed_inverse_a\nclaimed_inverse_a * a = id\nThe drawback of this technique is that by transferring the calculation off-chain, we incur additional fees due to the increased size of the transaction, as CPU units are cheaper. The creator of the transaction is also burdened by this computation, which often precedes more intricate, non-trivial cryptographic calculations. In the application of zero knowledge, this calculation if often implemented in low-level code, and used via bindings, meaning that extracting these intermediary values breaks existing code and interfaces.\nIn conclusion, integrating modular exponentiation as a core built-in within Plutus is not only essential for enhancing cryptographic capabilities, but also for optimizing on-chain computations. The current approach, which offloads certain calculations like finding multiplicative inverses to off-chain processes, is inefficient and costly in terms of transaction size and computational burden on the transaction creators. Incorporating this function directly into Plutus will streamline these operations, reduce transaction costs, and maintain the integrity of existing tools, thereby significantly advancing the Plutus ecosystem's functionality and user experience.\nA nonexclusive list of cryptographic protocols that use a field and would benefit from having this built-in are:\nx\ny\ny\nModular exponentiation is mathematically defined as the equivalence relation\nHere we have that the base bbb is an integer, the exponent eee a non-negative integer and the modulus mmm a positive integer. To be more specific, we want eee to be larger or equal to zero, and mmm is larger than zero. This is because what we are effectively doing, is multiplying eee copies of bbb and a modulo reduction by mmm. In this context, multiplying a negative number of copies of bbb has no definition.\nThat said, in the context of multiplicative inversion, a negative exponent can be interpreted as taking the exponent of the inverse of the base number. That is\nWe propose to also include this extension to the plutus built-in, for optimized inversion when this is possible. This is inversion is not guaranteed to exist for all numbers bbb, only when the modulus mmm is a prime number this is guaranteed. We also propose that the built-in fails if this inverse does not exist, and if a modulus is provided that is smaller than one.\nWith the above, we define a new Plutus built-in function with the following type signature\nmodularExponentiation :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Integer\nmodularExponentiation :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Integer\nhere the first argument is the base, the second the exponent and the third the modulus. As mentioned above, the behavior of this function is that it fails if the modulus is not a positive integer, or if the inverse of the base does not exist for a negative exponent. For the lower level implementation, we propose the usage of the integerPowMod function in the ghc-bignum packages. This function has the desired functionality, is optimized, and is easy to integrate in the plutus stack.\nintegerPowMod\nghc-bignum\nThe computational impact of modular exponentiation is complexified by it having three arguments. That said, observe that the integers used can always be bound by the modulus. Preliminary benchmarks on the time consumption of this integerPowMod function show that it can be costed constant in the size of its first argument (the base) and linear in the other two.\nintegerPowMod\nIntegrating this function directly into Plutus will streamline cryptographic operations, reduce transaction costs, and uphold the integrity of existing cryptographic interfaces. It addresses current inefficiencies and enhances the cryptographic capabilities of the Plutus platform.\nFor completeness and an historic perspective, the above functionality can also be attained by a new built-in function that performs normal exponentiation, after which one can reduce with the already present built-in function ModInteger. In the creation of this CIP, this possibility was discussed but put aside. This method has the flaw that the intermediate value of these integers is not bound. Meaning that memory consumption is not efficient for practical use in this setting.\nModInteger\nWe consider the following criteria to be essential for acceptance:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "prompt": "CIP0110?",
    "completion": "Despite making up less than half the transactions on Cardano, Plutus v1 scripts occupy around 40 of the total block space since chain inception, and sometimes higher during periods of peak activity. Increasing the space available to blocks is risky, as it impacts the block propagation time. This proposal puts forth a simple way to reduce this strain.\nPlutus v2 introduced a way to publish scripts on-chain, and reference those scripts to satisfy the witness requirement. However, because this was done via a new field on the transaction (i.e. \"Reference Inputs\"), which shows up in the script context, this feature is not backwards compatible with Plutus v1.\nHowever, of the 151gb it takes to represent the 6 year history of the chain, roughly 60 gb of that (nearly 40 ) can be attributed to the wasted space from repeating the same scripts in the last 2 years. This analysis was further confirmed by IOG in this issue.\nIt would be one thing if this was an issue mostly felt before or shortly after the Babbage hard-fork. It was assumed at the time that Plutus v2 would become a dominant player, and that usage of Plutus v1 contracts would die off. However, looking at recent trends in late 2023, it's clear this isn't happening.\nLooking at recent trends through late 2023, considering all scripts included in transactions, Plutus v1 hovered at or slightly below 50 of all scripts in transactions. However, comparing the size of transactions which execute scripts scripts, Plutus v1 scripts make up 90 of that space.\nLooking at periods of saturation can also help us understand where the limits of the chain are. Periods where activity is low and the chain is underutilized can skew our view of the problem: it largely doesn't matter to end users what percentage of space is occupied by different script versions, because the user experience is largely unimpacted and transactions are able to fit into the next block regardless. However, in periods of high activity, when blocks are nearly full, we get a better picture of where user activity is allocating that space, and where the cost savings would be most beneficial. For example, epoch 455 saw nearly 100 block usage for a full epoch, of which an average of 48 (and sometimes as high as 75 ) of the space was occupied by scripts, presumably much of that Plutus v1 scripts.\nThis problem isn't going away: while protocols may migrate to new Plutus v2 or v3 scripts, these old protocols will exist forever. Liquidity locked in these scripts, sometimes permanently, will mean that there is always an arbitrage opportunity that incentivizes a large portion of the block to be occupied by continually republishing these v1 scripts.\nAdditionally, raising the block size is considered incredibly sensitive, as it impacts block propagation times.\nA simple, backwards compatible mechanism for plutus v1 protocols to satisfy the script witness requirement, without changing the script context and causing breaking changes for Plutus v1 scripts, would alleviate quite literally millions of dollars worth of storage requirements, user pain, and developer frustration.\nWe propose relaxing the ledger rule that fails Plutus v1 scripts in transactions that have reference inputs, and to construct a script context that excludes reference inputs.\nThe ledger rule shouldn't change in other ways: for example, Plutus v1 scripts should still fail in the presence of inline datums or reference scripts on spent transaction inputs.\nThe main concern with this relates to backwards compatibility. The ledger makes very strong commitments regarding the behavior of scripts: any observable change represents a risk that there is some script out there that will either be unspendable when it should be, or spendable when it should not be.\nBecause of this, any such change which violates this must satisfy a burden of proof with regards to both the benefits and the risks. This was in fact considered in the original CIP, and at the time, it was decided that the justification would likely not meet that high bar.\nThus, as a rationale for this CIP, we repeat that analysis, hopefully with a different conclusion.\nIn terms of benefit, this approach would immediately allow all major plutus v1 dApps to reduce their transaction sizes dramatically. Some napkin math for both Sundae and Minswap shows that this would cut around 85 of the transaction size for each transaction; Considering the portion of block space currently taken up by Plutus v1 scripts, this represents a significant savings.\nIt is hard to overstate the long-term positive impact that this change could have for real users of the Cardano blockchain.\nIn terms of the risks, there are four main risks to consider:\nFunds that should be spendable are suddenly not spendable;\nIn this case, a user could simply continue to use the existing witness mechanism to provide the scripts, and those funds become spendable again.\nFunds that should not be spendable are suddenly spendable;\nIn this case, it is very hard to imagine a scenario where this would be true that isn't crafted intentionally. It would have to be some script that was dependent on the transaction fee being above a certain threshold, which is already a dangerous assumption to make given the updatable protocol parameters. In other instances (such as the change to how the minimum UTXO output is calculated) this kind of risk hasn't been an obstacle.\nThe execution units change, without changing the outcome, resulting in a different cost for the user;\nIn this case, the cost would only go down, and it is again hard to imagine a scenario where this is at material risk of violating some protocols integrity in a way that is not already compromised.\nGiven the parallel plans to include reference scripts in the cost of the transaction, outlined here, further mitigates these concerns.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "We propose to introduce a new Plutus scripts type Observe in addition to those currently available (spending, certifying, rewarding, minting, drep). The purpose of this script type is to allow arbitrary validation logic to be decoupled from any ledger action. Since observe validators are decoupled from actions, you can run them in a transaction without needing to perform any associated action (ie you don't need to consume a script input, or mint a token, or withdraw from a staking script just to execute this validator). Additionally, we propose to introduce a new assertion to native scripts that they can use to check that a particular script hash is in required_observers (which in turn enforces that the script must be executed successfully in the transaction). This addresses a number of technical issues discussed in other CIPs and CPS such as the redundant execution of spending scripts, and the inability to effectively use native scripts in conjunction with Plutus scripts.\nObserve\nrequired_observers\nOften in a plutus validator you want to check \"a particular (different) Plutus script checked this transaction\", but it's annoying (and wasteful) to have to have to lock an output in a script and then check if that output is consumed, or mint a token, or whatever else just to trigger script validation.\nCurrently the main design pattern used to achieve this is a very obscure trick involving staking validators and the fact that you can withdraw 0 from a staking validator to trigger the script validation. A summary of the trick is: Implement all the intended validation logic in a Plutus staking validator, we will call this validator s_v. To check that this validator was executed in the transaction you check if the credential of s_v (StakingCredential) is present in txInfoWdrl, this guarantees that s_v was checked in validation. This relies on the fact that unlike in txInfoMint the ledger does not filter out 0 amount entries in txInfoWdrl. This means that you are allowed to build transactions that withdraw zero from a staking credential which in-turn triggers the staking script associated with that credential to execute in the transaction, which makes it available in txInfoWdrl. This is a enables a very efficient design pattern for checking logic that is shared across multiple scripts.\ns_v\ns_v\nStakingCredential\ntxInfoWdrl\ns_v\ntxInfoMint\ntxInfoWdrl\ntxInfoWdrl\nFor instance, a common design pattern is a token based forwarding validator in which the validator defers its logic to another validator by checking that a state token is present in one of the transaction inputs:\nforwardNFTValidator :: AssetClass -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> () forwardNFTValidator stateToken _ _ ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (valueSpent (txInfo ctx)) == 1\nforwardNFTValidator :: AssetClass -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> () forwardNFTValidator stateToken _ _ ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (valueSpent (txInfo ctx)) == 1\nThis pattern is common in protocols that use the batcher architecture. Some protocols improve on the pattern by including the index of the input with the state token in the redeemer:\nforwardNFTValidator :: AssetClass -> BuiltinData -> Integer -> ScriptContext -> () forwardNFTValidator stateToken _ tkIdx ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (txInInfoResolved (elemAt tkIdx (txInfoInputs (txInfo ctx)))) == 1 forwardMintPolicy:: AssetClass -> Integer -> ScriptContext -> () forwardMintPolicy stateToken tkIdx ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (txInInfoResolved (elemAt tkIdx (txInfoInputs (txInfo ctx)))) == 1\nforwardNFTValidator :: AssetClass -> BuiltinData -> Integer -> ScriptContext -> () forwardNFTValidator stateToken _ tkIdx ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (txInInfoResolved (elemAt tkIdx (txInfoInputs (txInfo ctx)))) == 1 forwardMintPolicy:: AssetClass -> Integer -> ScriptContext -> () forwardMintPolicy stateToken tkIdx ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (txInInfoResolved (elemAt tkIdx (txInfoInputs (txInfo ctx)))) == 1\nThe time complexity of this validator is O(n) where n is the number of tx inputs. This logic is executed once per input being unlocked / currency symbol being minted. The redundant execution of searching the inputs for a token is the largest throughput bottleneck for these DApps; it is O(n*m) where n is the number of inputs and m is the number of forwardValidator inputs + forwardValidator minting policies. Using the stake validator trick, the time complexity of the forwarding logic is improved to O(1). The forwardValidator logic becomes:\nforwardValidator\nforwardValidator\nforwardWithStakeTrick:: StakingCredential -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> () forwardWithStakeTrick obsScriptCred tkIdx ctx = fst (head stakeCertPairs) == obsScriptCred where info = txInfo ctx stakeCertPairs = AssocMap.toList (txInfoWdrl info) stakeValidatorWithSharedLogic :: AssetClass -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> () stakeValidatorWithSharedLogic stateToken _rdmr ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (valueSpent (txInfo ctx)) == 1\nforwardWithStakeTrick:: StakingCredential -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> () forwardWithStakeTrick obsScriptCred tkIdx ctx = fst (head stakeCertPairs) == obsScriptCred where info = txInfo ctx stakeCertPairs = AssocMap.toList (txInfoWdrl info) stakeValidatorWithSharedLogic :: AssetClass -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> () stakeValidatorWithSharedLogic stateToken _rdmr ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (valueSpent (txInfo ctx)) == 1\nFor the staking validator trick (demonstrated above), we are simply checking that the StakingCredential of the the staking validator containing the shared validation logic is in the first pair in txInfoWdrl. If the StakingCredential is present in txInfoWdrl, that means the staking validator (with our shared validation logic) successfully executed in the transaction. This script is O(1) in the case where you limit it to one shared logic validator (staking validator), or if you don't want to break composability with other staking validator, then it becomes O(obs_N) where obs_N is the number of Observe validators that are executed in the transaction as you have to verify that the StakingCredential is present in txInfoWdrl.\ntxInfoWdrl\ntxInfoWdrl\nobs_N\ntxInfoWdrl\nThe proposed changes in this CIP enable this design pattern to exist indepedently from implementation details of stake validators and withdrawals, and improve efficiency and readability for validators that implement it. Furthermore, with the proposed extension to native scripts, we are able to completely get rid of the redundant spending script executions like so:\nobservationValidator :: AssetClass -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> () observationValidator stateToken _redeemer ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (valueSpent (txInfo ctx)) == 1\nobservationValidator :: AssetClass -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> () observationValidator stateToken _redeemer ctx = assetClassValueOf stateToken (valueSpent (txInfo ctx)) == 1\nWe simply include the script hash of the above observationValidator in the required_observers field in the transaction body and we lock all the UTxOs that we would like to share the same spending condition into the following native script:\nobservationValidator\nrequired_observers\n{ \"type\": \"observer\", \"keyHash\": \"OUR_OBSERVATION_SCRIPT_HASH\" }\n{ \"type\": \"observer\", \"keyHash\": \"OUR_OBSERVATION_SCRIPT_HASH\" }\nThe above solution (enabled by this CIP) is more clear, concise, flexible and efficient than the alternatives discussed above.\nThe type signature of this script type will be consistent with the type signature of minting and staking validators, namely:\nRedeemer -> ScriptContext -> ()\nRedeemer -> ScriptContext -> ()\nThe type signature of the newly introduced Purpose will be:\nPurpose\nObserve Integer -- ^ where integer is the index into the observations list.\nObserve Integer -- ^ where integer is the index into the observations list.\nScripts are passed information about transactions via the script context. We propose to augment the script context to include information about the observation scripts that are executed in the transaction.\nChanging the script context will require a new Plutus language version in the ledger to support the new interface. The change is: a new field is added to the script context which represents the list of observers that must be present in the transaction.\nThe interface for old versions of the language will not be changed. Scripts with old versions cannot be spent in transactions that include observation scripts, attempting to do so will be a phase 1 transaction validation failure.\nA new field will be introduced into the script context:\n-- | TxInfo for PlutusV3 data TxInfo = TxInfo { txInfoInputs :: [V2.TxInInfo] , txInfoReferenceInputs :: [V2.TxInInfo] , txInfoOutputs :: [V2.TxOut] , txInfoFee :: V2.Value , txInfoMint :: V2.Value , txInfoTxCerts :: [TxCert] , txInfoWdrl :: Map V2.Credential Haskell.Integer , txInfoValidRange :: V2.POSIXTimeRange , txInfoSignatories :: [V2.PubKeyHash] , txInfoRedeemers :: Map ScriptPurpose V2.Redeemer , txInfoData :: Map V2.DatumHash V2.Datum , txInfoId :: V2.TxId , txInfoVotingProcedures :: Map Voter (Map GovernanceActionId VotingProcedure) , txInfoProposalProcedures :: [ProposalProcedure] , txInfoCurrentTreasuryAmount :: Haskell.Maybe V2.Value , txInfoTreasuryDonation :: Haskell.Maybe V2.Value , txInfoObservations :: [V2.Credential] -- ^ newly introduced list of observation scripts that executed in this tx. }\n-- | TxInfo for PlutusV3 data TxInfo = TxInfo { txInfoInputs :: [V2.TxInInfo] , txInfoReferenceInputs :: [V2.TxInInfo] , txInfoOutputs :: [V2.TxOut] , txInfoFee :: V2.Value , txInfoMint :: V2.Value , txInfoTxCerts :: [TxCert] , txInfoWdrl :: Map V2.Credential Haskell.Integer , txInfoValidRange :: V2.POSIXTimeRange , txInfoSignatories :: [V2.PubKeyHash] , txInfoRedeemers :: Map ScriptPurpose V2.Redeemer , txInfoData :: Map V2.DatumHash V2.Datum , txInfoId :: V2.TxId , txInfoVotingProcedures :: Map Voter (Map GovernanceActionId VotingProcedure) , txInfoProposalProcedures :: [ProposalProcedure] , txInfoCurrentTreasuryAmount :: Haskell.Maybe V2.Value , txInfoTreasuryDonation :: Haskell.Maybe V2.Value , txInfoObservations :: [V2.Credential] -- ^ newly introduced list of observation scripts that executed in this tx. }\nThe CDDL for transaction body will change as follows to reflect the new field.\ntransaction_body = { 0 : set<transaction_input> ; inputs , 1 : [* transaction_output] , 2 : coin ; fee , ? 3 : uint ; time to live , ? 4 : certificates , ? 5 : withdrawals , ? 7 : auxiliary_data_hash , ? 8 : uint ; validity interval start , ? 9 : mint , ? 11 : script_data_hash , ? 13 : nonempty_set<transaction_input> ; collateral inputs , ? 14 : required_observers ; Upgraded `required_signers` , ? 15 : network_id , ? 16 : transaction_output ; collateral return , ? 17 : coin ; total collateral , ? 18 : nonempty_set<transaction_input> ; reference inputs , ? 19 : voting_procedures ; Voting procedures , ? 20 : proposal_procedures ; Proposal procedures , ? 21 : coin ; current treasury value , ? 22 : positive_coin ; donation } ; addr_keyhash variant is included for backwards compatibility and will be ; deprecated in the future era, because `credential` already contains `addr_keyhash`. required_observers = nonempty_set<credential / addr_keyhash>\ntransaction_body = { 0 : set<transaction_input> ; inputs , 1 : [* transaction_output] , 2 : coin ; fee , ? 3 : uint ; time to live , ? 4 : certificates , ? 5 : withdrawals , ? 7 : auxiliary_data_hash , ? 8 : uint ; validity interval start , ? 9 : mint , ? 11 : script_data_hash , ? 13 : nonempty_set<transaction_input> ; collateral inputs , ? 14 : required_observers ; Upgraded `required_signers` , ? 15 : network_id , ? 16 : transaction_output ; collateral return , ? 17 : coin ; total collateral , ? 18 : nonempty_set<transaction_input> ; reference inputs , ? 19 : voting_procedures ; Voting procedures , ? 20 : proposal_procedures ; Proposal procedures , ? 21 : coin ; current treasury value , ? 22 : positive_coin ; donation } ; addr_keyhash variant is included for backwards compatibility and will be ; deprecated in the future era, because `credential` already contains `addr_keyhash`. required_observers = nonempty_set<credential / addr_keyhash>\nWe rename the required_signers field to required_observers, promoting it from a list of public key hashes to a list of credentials (i.e. either a KeyHash or ScriptHash). This is consistent with other parts of the transaction that are unlocked by a script or a key witness. required_observers (field 14) is a set of credentials that must be satisfied by the transaction. For public key credentials, if the corresponding signature is not in the witness set, the transaction will fail in phase 1. For script credentials, if the associated scripts is not present in the witness set or as a reference script and executed in the transaction, the transaction will fail in phase 1 validation. This way Plutus scripts can check the script context to know which observation scripts were executed in the transaction. Similarly, since native script conditions use the required_observers field, it is natural that they are now able to require that other scripts observed the transaction (an extension of the ability to check for the presence of key signatures).\nrequired_signers\nrequired_observers\nrequired_observers\nrequired_observers\nThe BNF notation for the abstract syntax of native scripts change as follows to reflect the new field.\n<native_script> ::= <RequireSignature> <vkeyhash> | <RequireObserver> <scripthash> | <RequireTimeBefore> <slotno> | <RequireTimeAfter> <slotno> | <RequireAllOf> <native_script>* | <RequireAnyOf> <native_script>* | <RequireMOf> <num> <native_script>*\n<native_script> ::= <RequireSignature> <vkeyhash> | <RequireObserver> <scripthash> | <RequireTimeBefore> <slotno> | <RequireTimeAfter> <slotno> | <RequireAllOf> <native_script>* | <RequireAnyOf> <native_script>* | <RequireMOf> <num> <native_script>*\nNative scripts are typically represented in JSON syntax. We propose the following JSON representation for the RequireObserver constructor:\nRequireObserver\n{ \"type\": \"observer\", \"keyHash\": \"OBSERVATION_SCRIPT_HASH\" }\n{ \"type\": \"observer\", \"keyHash\": \"OBSERVATION_SCRIPT_HASH\" }\nCurrently Plutus scripts (and native scripts) in a transaction will only execute when the transaction performs the associated ledger action (ie. a Plutus minting policy will only execute if the transaction mints or burns tokens with matching currency symbol). The only exception is the withdraw zero trick which relies on an obscure mechanic where zero amount withdrawals are not filtered by the ledger. Now using required_observers we can specify a list of scripts (supports both native and Plutus scripts) to be executed in the transaction independent of any ledger actions. The newly introduced txInfoObservations field in the script context provides a straightforward way for scripts to check that \"a particular script validated this transaction\".\nrequired_observers\ntxInfoObservations\nThis change is not backwards-compatible and will need to go into a new Plutus language version.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "Cardano typically uses CBOR to encode structured data. For example, the Block data and individual transactions are all CBOR encoded.\nCIPs define many of the individual data structures used by both the Ledger and Metadata attached to transactions. This CIP defines a set of policies for the creation and maintenance of new CBOR tags for Cardano Data structures. It also collates a list of all currently defined Tags for easy reference. Finally, it recommends best practice for registering those Tags with IANA.\nThis CIP is motivated by the problems outlined in CPS-0014.\nCBOR defines a schemaless method of encoding data. Part of that specification (3.4) defines how generic data can be tagged to assist in the proper interpretation of the encoded data. Currently all Cardano data structures in both the Ledger and metadata do not widely use Tags. Nor is there any standardized way to create a new tag for a Cardano data structure.\nIANA maintains a registry of all CBOR Tags. Anyone can submit a request to register a tag in the range of 32768-18446744073709551615. These are known as First Come First Served tags. To register a tag, an applicant must demonstrate where the Tag is defined, and also the format of the data. If the data structure is defined by a CIP, the natural place to define its Tag is also in a CIP.\nTags can be defined for any data structure defined by a CIP or commonly used by Cardano. Examples of commonly used data structures could be those encoded inside the Cardano block or transaction. Tags should be defined by the following process:\nRegistration of the Tag with IANA is the sole responsibility of the CIP author. CIPs should not proceed to Active if they define unregistered Tags on data structures. This is to prevent abuse of the Tag number space.\nNOTE: Tags defined by any CIP or marked as not registered with IANA in the registry.json MUST NOT be used outside of testing. Tags not registered with IANA are subject to change during the IANA registration process.\nregistry.json\nCIPs, such as metadata CIPs can freely define when and how tags are used with any CBOR data structure. For example, a CIP may require that a particular field is always tagged. They may also define that a field need not be tagged if it is the typical data structure. Only less common or unusual data structures would be tagged in this case. A CIP may also define that Tags are not used, and only the canonical encoding.\nWhen a Tag is defined, its Canonical encoding must also be defined. This is to ensure that all data that is tagged is encoded in a uniform manor. Even if a CIP does NOT use a tag, it should preferably use the canonical encoding for the data structure. This is to prevent fragmentation and confusion amongst compliant encoders and decoders of the various data structures.\nIf a pre-existing data structure is being tagged, then its most common current encoding should be used as the Canonical encoding. It should not be re-defined.\nFor example ED25519-BIP32 public keys are commonly encoded as a byte array. The array is 32 bytes long with the most significant byte of the key appearing first in the array. If a Tag is defined for this public key, it should simply define the Tag. Its Canonical encoding MUST follow this common encoding scheme.\nED25519-BIP32\nIf a CIP does not refer to a Tag, nor the Canonical encoding specification for the data structure, AND it does not define an alternative encoding. Then the application implementing the encoding should assume it is encoded canonically. This helps ensure backward compatibility with pre-existing CIPs where Tags are not used.\nSimilar to [CIP-0010] this CIP defines a registry of all known tags. The format of the registry is defined by the json schema: CIP Tag Registry Schema. New entries MUST be added to the CIP Tag Registry in a PR for a CIP that first defines a new CBOR Tag. They MUST be updated when the Tag is accepted or rejected by IANA. The registry clearly notes if the tag is currently known to be registered or not. If a Tag is not yet registered then any implementor must be aware that its possible the Tag number could change and is not final. Unregistered tags MUST not be used in any main net on-chain metadata or data structures. They should only be used for testing purposes until registration is complete.\nCreating a registry for CIP Tag values has the following benefit:\nCIP Tag\nCIP Tags\nThe process for defining and registering Tags should help provide clarity about how a CIP tag can be defined. It also provides clarity on the responsibility CIP authors have to register the tags they create. If a CIP author is not prepared to take on that responsibility they should not create a Tag.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

The property we want to maintain is preserved regardless of the choice: for every block binary there is exactly one JSON encoding.\nThis CIP should not follow a conventional versioning scheme, rather it should be altered via pull request before a hardforks to add new a JSON schema to align with new ledger ers. Each schema must be standalone and not reuse definitions between eras. Authors MUST follow the Schema Scope, Schema Design Principles and Schema Conventions.\nFurthermore, for each subsequent schema, the changelog must be updated. Authors must clearly articulate the deltas between schemas.\nWe keep the scope of this standard to the data types within Cardano blocks. The rationale for this is that block data is by far the most useful for the majority of Cardano actors. There is also one nice benefit that the definitions can map directly from the provided CDDL file from ledger team.\nThis CIP lays out strong conventions that future schema authors must follow, along with a large set of design principles. The aim is to minimize the potential for unavoidable deltas between schemas.\nBy setting sometimes arbitrary conventions we hope to create a single possible interpretation from CBOR to JSON, alleviating any ambiguity.\nThe schemas MUST NOT be extensible with additional properties. This may sound counter-intuitive and against the spirit of json-schema, but there are some motivations behind that:\nJSON was chosen as there is no viable alternative. The majority of Cardano's web tooling is built with Javascript where JSON is the primary object representation format.\nFurthermore, even across non-Javascript based stacks, JSON enjoys wide tooling support, this improves the potential for builders to adopt this standard.\nWe choose to use Bech32 as the representation for Cardano addresses. When compared to the alternative of hexademical encoding, Bech32 gives the advantages of an included checksum and a human readable prefix.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

Some of these artefacts support linking to off-chain metadata as a way to provide context.\nThe CIP-100 | Governance Metadata standard provides a base framework for how all off-chain governance metadata should be formed and handled. But this is intentionally limited in scope, so that it can be expanded upon by more specific subsequent CIPs.\nThis proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to CIP-100 for DRep registration and updates. Without a sufficiently detailed standard for DRep metadata we introduce the possibility to undermine the ability of DReps to explain their motivations and therefore people looking for someone to represent them with the best possible information available to make that choice. Furthermore a lack of such standards risks preventing interoperability between tools, to the detriment of user experiences.\nThank you to everyone who participated in the CIP workshops, and to @ryun1 for creating the JSON-LD schemas for this CIP and for his excellent technical support and invaluble advice. Thank you also to the other CIP editors and attendees of the CIP Editors' Meetings where this CIP was refined, most notably @rphair and @Crypto2099.\nCIP-1694 has set forth a model of a blockchain controlled by its community, and in doing so has challenged providers to build apps and tools that will allow users easy access to the governance features currently being built into Cardano. Minimum viable tools must be ready at the time these governance features are launched.\nThe motivation for this CIP therefore is to provide these toolmakers with a simple and easy to accommodate standard which, once adopted, will allow them to read and display the metadata created by anyone who follows this standard when creating their DRep registration or update metadata. Tooling designed for DReps so that they can easily create metadata will also be made possible, because toolmakers will not need to individually innovate over the contents or structure of the metadata that their tool creates.\nMetadata is needed because blockchains are poor choices to act as content databases. This is why governance metadata anchors were chosen to provide a way to attach long form metadata content to on-chain events. By only supplying a url to the off-chain metadata, and a hash of that metadata to the blockchain we ensure correctness of data whilst minimising the amount of data posted on-chain.\nI believed that this CIP would provide a benefit to:\nWhen observing from the chain level, tooling can only see the content and history of DRep registration and update certificates and any associated anchors. These on-chain components do not give any context to the motivation of a DRep, even though this information would likely be the desired context for people who might delegate their voting power. By providing rich contextual metadata we enable people choosing a DRep to delegate their voting power to make well informed decisions.\nDReps will be able to use tools that create metadata in a standard format. This in turn will allow their metadata to be read by apps that will render their words on screen for potential delegating Ada Holders to enjoy, this may lead to greater levels of delegation.\nBy standardising off-chain metadata formats for any tooling which creates and/or renders metadata that is referenced in DRep registration and update transactions we facilitate interoperability. This in turn promotes a rich user experience between tooling. This is good for all governance participants.\nThis CIP explains the structure of any metadata referenced in a metadata anchor optionally included in any DRep registration or update transaction.\nThis CIP has been written for individuals acting in the capacity of DReps, and not for teams of people collaborating as a single DRep, although this does not preclude teams from using metadata in the structure explained by this CIP.\nDRep Metadata will not follow the CIP-100 specification related to signing the metadata, the authors property can be left blank without the need for tooling providers to warn their users that the author has not been validated. Instead the author can be derived from the DRep ID associated with the registration or update.

The SHA256 hash is needed in order for readers to verify that the image has not been altered since the metadata anchor was submitted on-chain.\nimageObject\ncontentUrl\nsha256\ncontentUrl\nobjectives\nmotivations\nqualifications\nknows\nknowsAbout\nreferences\nreferences\nreferences\n@type\nlabel\nuri\n@type\n@type\nlabel\nlabel\nlabel\nlabel\nlabel\nLink\nLink\nuri\n@type\nuri\n@type\nuri\ndoNotList\ntrue\nfalse\nfalse\ntrue\nfalse\ndoNotList=true\nOnly the givenName property is listed above as compulsory, DRep metadata must include it to be considered CIP-119 compliant. As this is an extension to CIP-100, all CIP-100 fields can be included within CIP-119 compliant metadata.\ngivenName\nSee test-vector.md for examples.\nThis proposal should not be versioned, to update this standard a new CIP should be proposed. Although through the JSON-LD mechanism further CIPs can add to the common governance metadata vocabulary.\nWe intentionally have kept this proposal brief and uncomplicated. This was to reduce the time to develop and deploy this standard. This way we enable tooling which depends on this standard to start development.\nThe compulsory nature of this field was controversial because the givenNames cannot be made unique and therefore are open to abuse (by e.g. copycats). However this is not a reason to not include a givenName, it a reason for people reviewing a DRep's profile to properly check their whole profile before delegating to them. A givenName MUST be included because a person must always have a name. Iit is a human readable identifier, it is the property that people reviewing DReps will most likely identify a given DRep by, even in the presence of copycats.\ngivenName\ngivenName\ngivenName\nIt has been suggested that the objectives, motivations, and qualifications properties (or at least the latter two) could be one freeform property instead of 3. The rationale for having 3 separate properties is to provide structure to DReps so that they have a useful set of prompts about what they can and should write about. The author noticed in research that a single bio field in a form typically resulted in lower quality, often single line, responses from respondents than when this bio field was split into smaller fields with more highly specified purposes.\nobjectives\nmotivations\nqualifications\nbio\nbio\nIt has also been suggested that the format of the input into these three properties could be more tightly specified for example qualifications could require a list of qualifications. Whilst this will probably be needed I have left this up to a future CIP to specify what these specifications should be because at this stage (MVP) I have no concrete examples of how people will end up using these fields and I want to leave it up to the community to experiment with this.\nqualifications\nPKI cryptographic solutions were also considered in the place of the current solution however they were generally considered too complex to implement for minimum viable tooling. There were also other issues with cryptographic forms of identification for MVPs:\nThis CIP is not written to specifically cover the metadata created to describe teams of people collaborating to register as a DRep, but it is written to cover the metadata created by individuals to describe themselves in their capacity as a DRep. Therefore DReps are people.\nPeople who want to extend the use of the DRep metadata can now do so in a way that allows tooling providers to use off the peg solutions. Furthermore there may be SEO benefits to using schema.org templates.\nimageObject\nAccording to schema.org The image property inherited from Person can either be a URL to a separate location where an image is stored, or it can be an imageObject.\nimage\nimageObject\nFor the following reasons it was originally intended that this CIP would specify the use of an imageObject with a b64 encoded image only, because:\nimageObject\nHowever it was pointed out that this may quickly lead to relatively massive (multi-megabyte) metadata files that are more difficult to fetch and store without providing substantial value. Even IPFS would take a relatively long time to serve these files, and if there was a need to index them by some chain indexer (such as DB-Sync) then this could massively increase the storage space needed to run the indexer.\nIt is also the case that CIP-100 allows for metadata to be saved within a governance transaction, and including b64 encoded images directly within transactions would be troublesome due to their size. This would not be an issue with including an image file URL.\nTherefore it was decided to allow a provision for people to submit imageObject's with a URL only if a hash was included OR with a base64 encoded image, and allow them to make the decision as to which was most appropriate for their use case.\nimageObject\ndoNotList\nThis field was intended for DReps who wish to identify themselves via rich metadata but are not seeking to campaign for delegations. By not being listed via \"DRep aggregation/campaign\" tools the idea is that these DReps are less likely to attract unwanted delegation from ada holders. These DReps could be organizations that want to use their ada to vote in a transparent way on-chain but do not wish to vote on the behalf of others.\nIt is expected that tooling such as block explorers will list DReps using doNotList=true. Tooling built specifically for DRep campaign and delegation should respect the intent of this field.\ndoNotList=true\nThis proposal cannot force tooling to respect this desire from DReps. DReps must be aware that any information anchored on-chain can be found via tooling and may result in delegation.\nCIP-1694 allows for DReps to be registered using a native or Plutus script credential, this implies that individuals could organise to form a team that would have a broad range of expertise, and would perhaps therefore be more attractive to some delegating Ada Holders.\nParticipants at the workshop held to debut the first draft of this CIP strongly advocated in favour of including features that would assist a DRep comprised of a team of individuals to properly describe their endeavour.\nThis CIP has not included these features, the decision not to include these features was made in order to simplify this CIP so that it became suitable for the minimum viable level of tooling, with the expectation that further CIPs will build on it.\nbio\npaymentAddress\ntype\nThere have been 3 lively public workshops on this subject, and I would like to thank the following people\nA recording of this meeting can be found here\nA recording of this meeting can be found here\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "Cardano's minimum viable governance model as described within CIP-1694 | A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance introduces the concept of a Cardano constitution. Although CIP-1694 gives no definition to the constitution's content or form.\nThis proposal aims to describe a standardized technical form for the Cardano Constitution to enhance the accessibility and safety of the document.\nNote: This proposal only covers the technical form of the constitution, this standard is agnostic to the content of the constitution.\nCIP-1694 defines the on-chain anchor mechanism used to link the off-chain Constitution document to on-chain actions. This mechanism was chosen due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness, moving the potentially large Cardano constitution off-chain, leaving only a hash digest and URI on-chain. This is the extent to which CIP-1694 outlines the Cardano Constitution: CIP-1694 does not provide suggestions around hashing algorithm, off-chain storage best practices or use of rich text styling.\nBy formalizing the form of the constitution and its iterations, we aim to promote its longevity and accessibility. This is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the CIP-1694 governance model.\nThis standard will impact how Ada holders read the Constitution but the main stakeholders for this are the tool makers who wish to read, render and write a constitution.\nWithout describing best practices for the form and handling of the constitution, we risk the constitution document being stored in an insecure manner. By storing the constitution on a decentralized platform, we can ensure its immutability and permissionless access. This is a step to improve the longevity and accessibility of each constitution iteration.\nBy defining a file extension and formatting rules for the constitution we ensure that tooling reading and writing the constitution will be interoperable. Furthermore we aim to make the role of constitution iteration comparison tools easier, by minimizing formatting and style changes between iterations. This will reduce compatibility issues between tools, promoting the accessibility of the constitution.\nRich text formatting greatly enhances the readability of text, especially in large complex documents. Without the ability to format text, it could easily become cumbersome to read, negatively effecting the accessability of the Cardano constitution.\nThe following specification SHOULD be applied to all constitution iterations. This standard could be augmented in the future via a separate CIP which aims to replace this one.\nTo avoid unnecessary edits, and therefore checksum changes, constitution authors MUST follow the following standard English capitalisation rules unless a translation language indicates otherwise:\nConstitution\nconstitution\nAda\nada\nADA\nAda\nada\nADA\nThe constitution text MUST only contain printable text characters in UTF-8 encoding.\nEach line in the constitution text MUST contain at maximum 80 characters, including spaces and punctuation.\nWhile 80 characters is a limit, authors don't have to try and always hit 80. Legibility of the raw (unrendered) document SHOULD be kept in mind.\nThe constitution text MUST only contain a maximum of one sentence per line, with each sentence followed by a newline. Each new sentence SHOULD start on its own line with a capitalized letter.\nLong sentences can be split multiple lines, when writing the author SHOULD try to split long sentences along natural breaks.\nExample:\nThis is a short sentence on one line. This is a long sentence and I have valid reasons for it being so long, such as being an example of a long sentence. When this sentence is rendered it SHOULD be shown to directly follow the sentence above. This sentence is the start of a new paragraph.\nThis is a short sentence on one line. This is a long sentence and I have valid reasons for it being so long, such as being an example of a long sentence. When this sentence is rendered it SHOULD be shown to directly follow the sentence above. This sentence is the start of a new paragraph.\nWhen rendered, these newlines between sentences SHOULD NOT be shown as newlines. Instead they SHOULD be rendered as a space character between sentences.\nParagraphs are shown by leaving a blank line between text.\nConstitution files MUST be .txt files.\n.txt\nConstitution files SHOULD be named in sequential whole numbers. Following the pattern cardano-constitution-{i}.txt where {i} is the iteration number.\ncardano-constitution-{i}.txt\n{i}\nStarting from an interim constitution named cardano-constitution-0.txt, the next constitution SHOULD be named cardano-constitution-1.txt.\ncardano-constitution-0.txt\ncardano-constitution-1.txt\nTo prevent misalignment, constitutions governing networks other than Cardano's mainnet, CAN be prefixed with the network name. For example, on the preview network the constitution file COULD be named preview-cardano-constitution-0.txt.\npreview-cardano-constitution-0.txt\nWhen supplying a constitution hash digest to chain, the algorithm used MUST be Blake2b-256. Before creating a hash digest the constitution plain text MUST be in its raw text, including any Rich Text Formatting related characters.\nThe each ratified constitution MUST be stored, immutably on a distributed storage mechanism where backups can be easily made in a permissionless manner by interested parties. This storage platform SHOULD be easily accessible, with strong tooling support.\nWhen generating a URI for the document, authors SHOULD NOT include centralized gateways.\nWe propose using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).\nThe constitution text MAY include a strict subset of rich text styling as defined in this specification. Tooling rendering the constitution SHOULD recognize these and render them faithfully.\nTo create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.\nExamples:\nHere's a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\nHere's a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\nHeaders are denoted via a hashtag character # followed by a space . There are six levels of headers, with each lower level set via an added #. Headers are ended via a line break. Headers SHOULD be followed below by a blank line. Headers SHOULD not be preceded by whitespace.\n#\n#\nThe lower the number of # the larger order the text SHOULD be rendered.\n#\nExample:\n# H1 ## H2 Some non-heading text. ### H3 #### H4 ##### H5 ###### H6\n# H1 ## H2 Some non-heading text. ### H3 #### H4 ##### H5 ###### H6\nIf text is in a header no other formatting can be applied.\nAn empty line SHOULD be left above and below each heading\nEmphasis is applied to text between single or double asterisks, without space between asterisks and text. Italicized emphasis is shown via single asterisk (*). Bold emphasis is shown via double asterisks (**).\n*\n**\nEmphasis cannot span multiple lines.\nExamples:\nEmphasis, aka italics, with single *asterisks*. Strong emphasis, aka bold, with double **asterisks**.\nEmphasis, aka italics, with single *asterisks*. Strong emphasis, aka bold, with double **asterisks**.\nBoth italicized and bold cannot be applied to the same text.\nTexted can be highlighted as code, when encased without spaces by backticks. This MUST not contain line breaks.\nExample:\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\nThe text contained within headings or emphasis cannot be highlighted as code.\nTo create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by one period and then one space. Each line item is separated by an empty line. The numbers MUST be in numerical order, but the list SHOULD start with the number one.\nOrdered lists MUST NOT have indented items. Ordered lists MUST NOT include headings.\n1. This is the first item in my ordered list 2. this is the second item in my list 3. the third item\n1. This is the first item in my ordered list 2. this is the second item in my list 3. the third item\nTo create an unordered list, add dashes (-) and one space, in front of line items. Each line item is separated by an empty line.\n-\nUnordered lists MUST NOT have indented items. Unordered lists MUST NOT start with a number followed by a period.\n- this is my list - I like unordered lists\n- this is my list - I like unordered lists\nUnordered lists MUST NOT include headings.\nWhen rendering the raw document tooling COULD use standard markdown rendering tools.\nWhen submitting an update constitution governance action, tooling SHOULD verify the document hash digest and matches the document.\nTooling reading constitution anchors from chain SHOULD always perform a correctness check using the hash digest on-chain. If the hash provided on-chain does not match the hash produced from the off-chain document, then the tooling SHOULD highlight this in a very obvious way to users.\nTools writing constitutions SHOULD strive to follow this specification. If tooling discovering and rendering constitution documents discovers that the document does not follow the \"MUST\"s in this specification then a small warning SHOULD be given to users.\nAuthors SHOULD aim to keep the document as clean and consistent as possible.\nText SHOULD try to be left aligned, without using unneeded whitespace leading or trailing lines.\nSpaces SHOULD be used over tab characters.\nThe last line in the document SHOULD be empty.\nSee Test vector file.\nWe choose to restrict the maximum number of characters per line in aims of improving readability of the document in plain text and within diff views.\nIt SHOULD also be considered that the 80-character limit also helps one find run-on sentences. If your sentence is much longer than 80, it might need breaking down. And you SHOULD never want to see a sentence that's over two lines long in normal text.\nBy limiting documents to one sentence per line we hope to improve the experience when comparing documents and commenting on specific sentences. Conventional document comparison tools such as git diff views, compare documents on a by line basis. By spreading text across lines, it greatly improves tooling's ability to differentiate between documents.\nFurthermore, isolating one sentence per line, allows users to more easily isolate specific lines to comment upon. This gives each sentence an unambiguous reference point, which can be very useful for sharing and discussing.\nWe chose to only allow replacement of this document rather than including a more conventional versioning scheme. This was done for simplicity to minimize the amount of effort required to create tooling which reads and writes constitutions.\nThe alternative was to add some details of version to the constitution document. This would make changing hashing algorithm, rich text formatting, etc. much easier. But this makes the standard and subsequent, more complex than necessary. We do not believe the added complexity is justified, for the expected number of future replacement CIPs to this one.\nThe text file was chosen, due to its ubiquity across platforms. By choosing a common format, we improve the accessibility of the raw document.\nWe choose to add sequential numbering to constitution document iterations to improve differentiation between documents.\nBlake2b-256 was chosen for its common use across the Cardano ecosystem. This means that a lot of Cardano tooling already has this algorithm implemented. This lowers the bar to entry for existing tool makers to add constitutional support.\nFor simplicity, we decide not to include an easy mechanism for changing of hashing algorithms between constitutions.\nEnsuring the Cardano Constitution and its iterations can be accessed in a permissionless manor is paramount. Permissionless networks such as IPFS reduce the ability for parties to censor the content. With each interested party able to make copies of constitutions, this improves the resilience of the documents from deletion.\nThe primary competing idea to platforms such as IPFS is to store the constitution text on Cardano itself. This would philosophically be superior to storing the document off-chain, keeping the Cardano Constitution on Cardano. The counter point to this is that, Cardano is not a general data storage system, rather it is a ledger. Storing data on Cardano is expensive and difficult, without strong tooling support.\nRich text styling will greatly improve the readability of the constitution documents, when rendered.\nMarkdown styling was chosen due to its ubiquity, with strong tooling support. Furthermore, markdown has a benefit in that the unrendered documents are still human readable. This is in contrast to other solutions such as HTML.\nWe chose a strict subset of markdown text styling for two reasons. Firstly, markdown contains a very large and varied syntax, reducing the scope making implementation easier for all tooling. Secondly, some features of markdown may not want to be used in a formal constitution document. Embedded HTML or videos are likely things to be avoided.\ncardano-constitution\nWe would like to thank those who reviewed the first draft of this proposal;\nWe would like to thank Robert Phair (@rphair) for his expert contributions to this proposal.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "Plutus Core primitive operations to convert BuiltinInteger to BuiltinByteString, and vice-versa. Furthermore, the BuiltinInteger conversion allows different endianness for the encoding (most-significant-first and most-significant-last), as well as padding with zeroes based on a requested length if required.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nPlutus Core creates a strong abstraction boundary between the concepts of 'number' (represented by BuiltinInteger) and 'blob of bytes' (represented by BuiltinByteString), defining different sets of (largely non-overlapping) operations for each. This is, in principle, a good practice, as these concepts are distinct in (most of) the operations that make sense on them. However, sometimes, being able to 'move between' these two 'worlds' is important: namely, the ability to represent a given BuiltinInteger as a BuiltinByteString, as well as to convert between this representation and the BuiltinInteger it represents. Currently, no such capability exists: while CIP-0058 proposed such a capability (among others), to date, this has not been implemented into Plutus Core.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nTo see why such a capability would be beneficial, we give two motivating use cases.\nConsider the following code snippet:\nvalidBidTerms :: AuctionTerms -> CurrencySymbol -> BidTerms -> Bool validBidTerms AuctionTerms {..} auctionID BidTerms {..} | BidderInfo {..} <- bt'Bidder = validBidderInfo bt'Bidder && -- The bidder pubkey hash corresponds to the bidder verification key. verifyEd25519Signature at'SellerVK (sellerSignatureMessage auctionID bi'BidderVK) bt'SellerSignature && -- The seller authorized the bidder to participate verifyEd25519Signature bi'BidderVK (bidderSignatureMessage auctionID bt'BidPrice bi'bidderPKH) bt'BidderSignature -- The bidder authorized the bid bidderSignatureMessage :: CurrencySymbol -> Integer -> PubKeyHash -> BuiltinByteString bidderSignatureMessage auctionID bidPrice bidderPKH = toByteString auctionID <> toByteString bidPrice <> toByteString bidderPKH sellerSignatureMessage :: CurrencySymbol -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString sellerSignatureMessage auctionID bidderVK = toByteString auctionID <> bidderVK\nvalidBidTerms :: AuctionTerms -> CurrencySymbol -> BidTerms -> Bool validBidTerms AuctionTerms {..} auctionID BidTerms {..} | BidderInfo {..} <- bt'Bidder = validBidderInfo bt'Bidder && -- The bidder pubkey hash corresponds to the bidder verification key. verifyEd25519Signature at'SellerVK (sellerSignatureMessage auctionID bi'BidderVK) bt'SellerSignature && -- The seller authorized the bidder to participate verifyEd25519Signature bi'BidderVK (bidderSignatureMessage auctionID bt'BidPrice bi'bidderPKH) bt'BidderSignature -- The bidder authorized the bid bidderSignatureMessage :: CurrencySymbol -> Integer -> PubKeyHash -> BuiltinByteString bidderSignatureMessage auctionID bidPrice bidderPKH = toByteString auctionID <> toByteString bidPrice <> toByteString bidderPKH sellerSignatureMessage :: CurrencySymbol -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString sellerSignatureMessage auctionID bidderVK = toByteString auctionID <> bidderVK\nHere, we attempt to verify (using the Curve25519) that a bid at an auction was signed by a particular bidder. The message to verify must include the bid placed, represented using Integer here (which translates to BuiltinInteger onchain). However, the verifyEd25519Signature primitive can only accept BuiltinByteStrings as messages to verify. Thus, we have a problem: how to include the placed bid into the bid message to be verified?\nInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nverifyEd25519Signature\nBuiltinByteString\nMore generally, constructing messages to sign usually consists of concatenating together some primitives represented as BuiltinByteStrings. We currently have a way to do this for (some) strings using encodeUtf8, but no way to do this for BuiltinIntegers.\nBuiltinByteString\nencodeUtf8\nBuiltinInteger\nFinite fields, also known as Galois fields, are a common algebraic structure in cryptographic constructions. Many, if not most, common constructions in cryptography use finite fields as their basis, including Curve25519, Curve448 and the Pasta curves, to name but a few. Elements in a finite field are naturally representable as BuiltinIntegers of bounded size onchain, but for applications like the constructions specified above (and indeed, anything built atop such constructions), we need to be able to perform the following tasks efficiently:\nBuiltinInteger\nFurthermore, Case 2 presents two further challenges: endianness and padding. Due to many cryptographic algorithms being designed for use over the network, their specifications assume a big-endian byte ordering in their implementations. Likewise, due to the finiteness of a finite field's elements, they can be encoded in a fixed-length form, which implementations make use of, both for convenience and efficiency.\nWhile it is not outright impossible to perform conversions from BuiltinInteger to BuiltinByteString currently, it is unreasonably difficult and resource-intensive: BuiltinInteger to BuiltinByteString involves a repeated combination of division-with-remainder in a loop, while BuiltinByteString to BuiltinInteger involves repeated multiplications by large constants and accumulations. Aside from these both requiring looping (with the overheads this imposes), both of these are effectively quadratic operations with current primitives: the only means we have to accumulate BuiltinByteStrings is by consing or appending (which are both quadratic due to BuiltinByteString being a counted array), and any BuiltinInteger operation is linear in the size of its arguments. This makes even Case 1 far more effort, both for the developer and the node, than it should be, and Case 2 ranges from difficult to impossible once we factor in the limited available primitive operations and the endianness and padding problems.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nWe propose that two primitives be added to Plutus Core: one for converting BuiltinIntegers to BuiltinByteStrings, the other for converting BuiltinByteStrings to BuiltinIntegers. The first of these primitives would allow for specifying an endianness for the result, as well as to perform padding to a required length if necessary; the second primitive is able to operate on padded or unpadded encodings, in either endianness.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nAdditionally, we state the following goals that any implementation of such primitives must have.\nThe representation produced by the BuiltinInteger to BuiltinByteString conversion should be 'minimal', representing only the number being given to it, and no other information besides. It would be tempting to, for example, encode the endianness requested into the BuiltinByteString, but ultimately, this information could be added later by users if they want it, while removing it would be trickier. Additionally, metadata-related concerns would complicate both the specification and implementation of the primitives, for arguably marginal benefit.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nUsers of these primitives should not need to know how exactly BuiltinIntegers are represented to use them successfully. This is beneficial to both users (as they now don't have to concern themselves with platform-specific implementation issues) and Plutus Core maintainers (as changes in the representation of BuiltinInteger aren't going to affect these primitives).\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nWhile for fixed-size numbers, two's-complement is the default choice for negative number representations, for arbitrary-size numbers, there is no agreed-upon choice. Furthermore, indicating the 'negativity' of a number would require making representations larger or more complex regardless of which representation we chose, while also complicating both the primitives we want to define, and any user-defined operations on such representations, possibly in ways that users do not want. Lastly, for our cases, negative values are not really needed, and if the ability to encode negative numbers was necessary, users could still define whichever one(s) they needed themselves, with little effort or computational cost.\nThis CIP partially supercedes CIP-0058: specifically, the specifications here replace the integerToByteString and byteStringToInteger primitives specified in CIP-0058, as improved, and more general, solutions.\nintegerToByteString\nbyteStringToInteger\nWe describe the specification of two Plutus Core primitives, which will have the following signatures:\nbuiltinIntegerToByteString :: BuiltinBool -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinByteString\nbuiltinByteStringToInteger :: BuiltinBool -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger\nTo describe the semantics of these primitives, we first specify how we represent a BuiltinInteger as a BuiltinByteString; after that, we describe the two primitives, as well as giving some properties they must follow.\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nOur BuiltinByteString representations of non-negative BuiltinIntegers treat the BuiltinInteger being represented as a sequence of digits in base-256. Thus, any byte in the BuiltinByteString representation corresponds to a single base-256 digit, whose digit value is equal to its value as an 8-bit unsigned integer. For example, the byte 0x80 would have digit value 128, while the byte 0x03 would have digit value 3.\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\n0x80\n0x03\nTo determine place value, we define two possible arrangements of digits in such a representation: most-significant-first, and most-significant-last. In the most-significant-first representation, the first digit (that is, the byte at index 0) has the highest place value; in the most-significant-last representation, the first digit instead has the lowest place value. These correspond to the notions of big-endian and little-endian respectively.\nFor any positive BuiltinInteger i, let\nBuiltinInteger\ni\ni0 2560+i1 2561+ +ik 256ki_0 \\times 256 0 + i_1 \\times 256 1 + \\ldots + i_k \\times 256 ki0 2560+i1 2561+ +ik 256k\nbe its base-256 form. Then, for the most-significant-first representation, the BuiltinByteString encoding for i is the BuiltinByteString b such that indexByteString bs j=ik j\\texttt{indexByteString bs j} = i_{k - j}indexByteString bs j=ik j . For the most-significant-last encoding, we instead have indexByteString bs j=ij\\texttt{indexByteString bs j} = i_jindexByteString bs j=ij .\nBuiltinByteString\ni\nBuiltinByteString\nb\nFor example, consider the number 123_456. Its base-256 form is\n123_456\n64 * 256 ^ 0 + 226 * 256 ^ 1 + 1 * 256 ^ 2\n64 * 256 ^ 0 + 226 * 256 ^ 1 + 1 * 256 ^ 2\nTherefore, its most-significant-first representation would be\n[ 0x01, 0xE2, 0x40 ]\n[ 0x01, 0xE2, 0x40 ]\nwhile its most-significant-last representation would be\n[ 0x40, 0xE2, 0x01 ]\n[ 0x40, 0xE2, 0x01 ]\nFor 0, in line with the above definition, both its most-significant-first and most-significant-last representation is [] (that is, the empty BuiltinByteString).\n0\n[]\nBuiltinByteString\nTo represent any given non-negative BuiltinInteger i as above, we require a minimum number of base-256 digits. For positive i, this is max 1, log 256(i) \\max \\\\{1, \\lceil \\log_{256}(\\texttt{i}) \\rceil \\\\}max1, log256 (i) ; for i = 0, we define this to be 000. We can choose to represent i with more digits than this minimum, by the use of padding. Let kkk be the minimum number of digits to represent i, and let jjj be a positive number: to represent i using k+jk + jk+j digits in the most-significant-first encoding, we set the first jjj bytes of the encoding as 0x0; for the most-significant-last encoding, we set the last jjj bytes of the encoding as 0x0 instead.\nBuiltinInteger\ni\ni\ni = 0\ni\ni\ni\n0x0\n0x0\nTo extend our previous example, a five-digit, most-significant-first representation of 123_456 is\n123_456\n[ 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0xC2, 0x80 ]\n[ 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0xC2, 0x80 ]\nwhile the most-significant-last representation would be\n[ 0x80, 0xC2, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00 ]\n[ 0x80, 0xC2, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00 ]\nWe observe that these extra digits do not change what exact BuiltinInteger is represented, as any zero digit has zero place value.\nBuiltinInteger\nbuiltinIntegerToByteString\nWe can now describe the semantics of the builtinIntegerToByteString primitive. The builtinIntegerToByteString function takes three arguments; we specify (and name) them below:\nbuiltinIntegerToByteString\nbuiltinIntegerToByteString\nBuiltinBool\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nIf the input is negative, builtinIntegerToByteString fails.

Our specified primitives address both the problems of endianness and padding specified in Case 2, while also ensuring that use cases like Case 1 (where bounding length isn't important) are not made more difficult than necessary. The representation we have chosen is metadata-free, doesn't depend on any representation choices (current or future) of BuiltinInteger, while also being flexible enough to satisfy both cases where endianness and padding matter, and when they don't.\nBuiltinInteger\nAs part of this proposal, we considered two alternative possibilities:\nbuiltinIntegerToByteString\nCIP-0058 defines a sizeable collection of bitwise primitive operations for Plutus Core, mostly for use over BuiltinByteStrings. As part of these, it also defines conversion functions similar to builtinIntegerToByteString and builtinByteStringToInteger, which are named integerToByteString and byteStringToInteger respectively. Unlike the operations specified in this CIP, the CIP-0058 operations do not address the problems of either padding or endianness: more precisely, the representations constructed are always minimally-sized, and use a big-endian encoding. While in the context they are being presented in, these choices are defensible, they do not adequately address Case 2, and in particular, many cryptographic constructions used with finite fields. Users of the CIP-0058 primitives who needed to ensure a minimum length of a converted BuiltinInteger would have to pad manually, which CIP-0058 gives no additional support for; additionally, if a little-endian representation was required, the BuiltinByteString result would have to be reversed, which has quadratic cost if using only Plutus Core primitives. Thus, we consider these implementations to be a good attempt, but not suited to even their intended use, much less more general applications.\nBuiltinByteString\nbuiltinIntegerToByteString\nbuiltinByteStringToInteger\nintegerToByteString\nbyteStringToInteger\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nAn alternative possibility for the length argument of builtinIntegerToByteString would be to treat the argument as either a minimum, or a maximum, rather than our more hybrid approach. Specifically, for any input i, let d be the minimum number of digits required to represent i as per the description of our representation, and let k be the length argument. Then:\nbuiltinIntegerToByteString\ni\nd\ni\nk\nk\nBoth the minimum length argument, and the maximum length argument, approaches have merits. The maximum length argument approach in particular is useful for Case 2: in such a setting, we already know the maximum size of any element's representation, and if we somehow ended up with a larger representation than this, it would be a mistake, which the maximum length argument would catch immediately. For the minimum length argument approach, the advantage would be more for Case 1: where the length of the representation is not known (and the user isn't particularly concerned anyway). In such a situation, the user could pass any argument and know that the conversion would still work.\nHowever, both of these approaches have disadvantages as well. The minimum length argument approach would be more tedious to use with Case 2, as each conversion would require a size check of the resulting BuiltinByteString. While this is not expensive, it is annoying, and given the complexity of the constructions that would be built atop of any finite field implementations, it feels unreasonable to require this from users. Likewise, the maximum length argument approach is unreasonable for situations like Case 1: the only way to establish how many digits would be required involves performing an integer logarithm in base 256, which is inefficient and error-prone. Our hybrid approach gives the benefits of both the minimum length argument and maximum length argument approaches, without the downsides of either: we observe that, for situations like Case 1, the length argument would be 0 in practically all cases, which is a value that would not be useful in any situation where the maximum length argument approach would be used. This observation allows our approach to work equally well for both Case 1 and 2, with minimal friction.\nBuiltinByteString\n0\nWe consider the following criteria to be essential for acceptance:\nIdeally, the implementation should also demonstrate its performance characteristics by well-designed benchmarks.\nMLabs have completed the implementation of the proof of concept as required (located here.

    "prompt": "CIP0122?",
    "completion": "We describe the semantics of a set of logical operations for Plutus BuiltinByteStrings. Specifically, we provide descriptions for:\nBuiltinByteString\nAs part of this, we also describe the bit ordering within a BuiltinByteString, and provide some laws these operations should obey.\nBuiltinByteString\nBitwise operations, both over fixed-width and variable-width blocks of bits, have a range of uses, including data structures (especially succinct ones) and cryptography. Currently, operations on individual bits in Plutus Core are difficult, or outright impossible, while also keeping within the tight constraints required onchain. While it is possible to some degree to work with individual bytes over BuiltinByteStrings, this isn't sufficient, or efficient, when bit maniputations are required.\nBuiltinByteString\nTo demonstrate where bitwise operations would allow onchain possibilities that are currently either impractical or impossible, we give the following use cases.\nAn integer set (also known as a bit set, bitmap, or bitvector) is a succinct data structure for representing a set of numbers in a pre-defined range [0,n)[0, n)[0,n) for some n Nn \\in \\mathbb{N}n N. The structure supports the following operations:\nThese structures have a range of uses. In addition to being used as sets of bounded natural numbers, an integer set could also represent an array of Boolean values. These have a range of applications, mostly as 'backends' for other, more complex structures. Furthermore, by using some index arithmetic, integer sets can also be used to represent binary matrices (in any number of dimensions), which have an even wider range of uses:\nThe succinctness of the integer set (and the other succinct data structures it enables) is particularly valuable on-chain, due to the limited transaction size and memory available.\nTypically, such a structure would be represented as a packed array of bytes (similar to the Haskell ByteString). Essentially, given a bound nnn, the packed array has a length in bytes large enough to contain at least nnn bits, with a bit at position iii corresponding to the value i Ni \\in \\mathbb{N}i N. This representation ensures the succinctness of the structure (at most 7 bits of overhead are required if n=8k+1n = 8k + 1n=8k+1 for some k Nk \\in \\mathbb{N}k N), and also allows all the above operations to be implemented efficiently:\nByteString\n0x00\n0xFF\nGiven that this is a packed representation, these operations can be implemented very efficiently by relying on the cache-friendly properties of packed array traversals, as well as making use of optimized routines available in many languages. Thus, this structure can be used to efficiently represent sets of numbers in any bounded range (as ranges not starting from 000 can be represented by storing an offset), while also being minimal in space usage.\nCurrently, such a structure cannot be easily implemented in Plutus Core while preserving the properties described above. The two options using existing primitives are either to use [BuiltinInteger], or to mimic the above operations over BuiltinByteString. The first of these is not space or time-efficient: each BuiltinInteger takes up multiple machine words of space, and the list overheads introduced are linear in the number of items stored, destroying succinctness; membership testing, insertion and removal require either maintaining an ordered list or forcing linear scans for at least some operations, which are inefficient over lists; and 'bulk' operations like union, intersection and complement become very difficult and time-consuming. The second is not much better: while we preserve succinctness, there is no easy way to access individual bits, only bytes, which would require a division-remainder loop for each such operation, with all the overheads this imposes; intersection, union and symmetric difference would have to be simulated byte-by-byte, requiring large lookup tables or complex conditional logic; and construction would require immense amounts of copying and tricky byte construction logic. While it is not outright impossible to make such a structure using current primitives, it would be so impractical that it could never see real use.\n[BuiltinInteger]\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nFurthermore, for sparse (or dense) integer sets (that is, where either most elements in the range are absent or present respectively), a range of compression techniques have been developed. All of these rely on bitwise operations to achieve their goals, and can potentially yield significant space savings in many cases. Given the limitations onchain that we have to work within, having such techniques available to implementers would be a huge potential advantage.\nHashing, that is, computing a fixed-length 'fingerprint' or 'digest' of a variable-length input (typically viewed as binary) is a common task required in a range of applications. Most notably, hashing is a key tool in cryptographic protocols and applications, either in its own right, or as part of a larger task. The value of such functionality is such that Plutus Core already contains primitives for certain hash functions, specifically two variants of SHA256 and BLAKE2b. At the same time, hash functions choices are often determined by protocol or use case, and providing individual primitives for every possible hash function is not a scalable choice. It is much preferrable to give necessary tools to implement such functionality to users of Plutus (Core), allowing them to use whichever hash function(s) their applications require.\nAs an example, we consider the Argon2 family of hash functions. In order to implement any variant of this family requires the following operations:\nOperations 1 to 5 are already provided by Plutus Core (with 1 being included in CIP-121); however, without logical XOR, no function in the Argon2 family could be implemented. While in theory, it could be simulated with what operations already exist, much as with Case 1, this would be impractical at best, and outright impossible at worst, due to the severe limits imposed on-chain. This is particularly the case here, as all Argon2 variants call logical XOR in a loop, whose step count is defined by multiple user-specified (or protocol-specified) parameters.\nWe observe that this requirement for logical XOR is not unique to the Argon2 family of hash functions. Indeed, logical XOR is widely used for a variety of cryptographic applications, as it is a low-cost mixing function that happens to be self-inverting, as well as preserving randomness (that is, a random bit XORed with a non-random bit will give a random bit).\nWe describe the proposed operations in several stages. First, we specify a scheme for indexing individual bits (rather than whole bytes) in a BuiltinByteString. We then specify the semantics of each operation, as well as giving costing expectations and some examples. Lastly, we provide some laws that any implementation of these operations is expected to obey.\nBuiltinByteString\nWe begin by observing that a BuiltinByteString is a packed array of bytes (that is, BuiltinIntegers in the range [0,255][0, 255][0,255]) according to the API provided by existing Plutus Core primitives. In particular, we have the ability to access individual bytes by index as a primitive operation. Thus, we can view a BuiltinByteString as an indexed collection of bytes; for any BuiltinByteString bbb of length nnn, and any i 0,1, ,n 1i \\in 0, 1, \\ldots, n - 1i 0,1, ,n 1, we define bib\\\\{i\\\\}bi as the byte at index iii in bbb, as defined by the indexByteString primitive. In essence, for any BuiltinByteString of length n, we have byte indexes as follows:\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nindexByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nn\n| Index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |-------|----|----| ... |----------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) |\n| Index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |-------|----|----| ... |----------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) |\nTo view a BuiltinByteString as an indexed collection of bits, we must first consider the bit ordering within a byte. Suppose i 0,1, ,7i \\in 0, 1, \\ldots, 7i 0,1, ,7 is an index into a byte www. We say that the bit at iii in www is set when\nBuiltinByteString\nOtherwise, the bit at iii in www is clear. We define w[i]w[i]w[i] to be 111 when the bit at iii in www is set, and 000 otherwise; this is the value at index iii in www.\nFor example, consider the byte represented by the BuiltinInteger 42. By the above scheme, we have the following:\nBuiltinInteger\nPut another way, we can view w[i]=1w[i] = 1w[i]=1 to mean that the (i+1)(i + 1)(i+1) th least significant digit in www's binary representation is 111, and likewise, w[i]=0w[i] = 0w[i]=0 would mean that the iiith least significant digit in www's binary representation is 000. Continuing with the above example, 424242 is represented in binary as 00101010; we can see that the second-least-significant, fourth-least-significant, and sixth-least-significant digits are 1, and all the others are zero. This description mirrors the way bytes are represented on machine architectures.\n00101010\n1\nWe now extend the above scheme to BuiltinByteStrings. Let bbb be a BuiltinByteString whose length is nnn, and let i 0,1, ,8 n 1i \\in 0, 1, \\ldots, 8 \\cdot n - 1i 0,1, ,8 n 1. For any j 0,1, ,n 1j \\in 0, 1, \\ldots, n - 1j 0,1, ,n 1, let j =n j 1j {\\prime} = n - j - 1j =n j 1. We say that the bit at iii in bbb is set if\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nWe define the bit at iii in bbb being clear analogously. Similarly to bits in a byte, we define b[i]b[i]b[i] to be 111 when the bit at iii in bbb is set, and 000 otherwise; similarly to bytes, we term this the value at index iii in bbb.\nAs an example, consider the BuiltinByteString [42, 57, 133]: that is, the BuiltinByteString bbb such that b0=42b\\\\{0\\\\} = 42b0=42, b1=57b\\\\{1\\\\} = 57b1=57 and b2=133b\\\\{2\\\\} = 133b2=133. We observe that the range of 'valid' bit indexes iii into bbb is in [0,3 8 1=23][0, 3 \\cdot 8 - 1 = 23][0,3 8 1=23]. Consider i=4i = 4i=4; by the definition above, this corresponds to the byte index 2, as 48 =0\\left\\lfloor\\frac{4}{8}\\right\\rfloor = 0 84 =0, and 3 0 1=23 - 0 - 1 = 23 0 1=2 (as bbb has length 333). Within the byte 133133133, this means we have 13324 mod 2 0\\left\\lfloor\\frac{133}{2 4}\\right\\rfloor \\mod 2 \\equiv 0 24133 mod2 0. Thus, b[4]=0b[4] = 0b[4]=0. Consider instead the index i=19i = 19i=19; by the definition above, this corresponds to the byte index 0, as 198 =2\\left\\lfloor\\frac{19}{8}\\right\\rfloor = 2 819 =2, and 3 2 1=03 - 2 - 1 = 03 2 1=0. Within the byte 424242, this means we have 4223 mod 2 1\\left\\lfloor\\frac{42}{2 3}\\right\\rfloor\\mod 2 \\equiv 1 2342 mod2 1. Thus, b[19]=1b[19] = 1b[19]=1.\nBuiltinByteString\n[42, 57, 133]\nBuiltinByteString\nPut another way, our byte indexes run 'the opposite way' to our bit indexes. Thus, for any BuiltinByteString of length nnn, we have bit indexes relative byte indexes as follows:\nBuiltinByteString\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |------------|--------------------------------|----| ... |-------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) | |------------|--------------------------------|----| ... |-------------------------------| | Bit index | 8n - 1 | 8n - 2 | ... | 8n - 8 | ... | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |------------|--------------------------------|----| ... |-------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) | |------------|--------------------------------|----| ... |-------------------------------| | Bit index | 8n - 1 | 8n - 2 | ... | 8n - 8 | ... | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\nWe describe precisely the operations we intend to implement, and their semantics. These operations will have the following signatures:\nbitwiseLogicalAnd :: BuiltinBool -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nbitwiseLogicalOr :: BuiltinBool -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nbitwiseLogicalXor :: BuiltinBool -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nbitwiseLogicalComplement :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinByteString\nreadBit :: BuiltinByteString -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinBool\nwriteBits :: BuiltinByteString -> [(BuiltinInteger, BuiltinBool)] -> BuiltinByteString\nreplicateByteString :: BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinInteger -> BuiltinByteString\nWe assume the following costing, for both memory and execution time:\nbitwiseLogicalAnd\nBuiltinByteString\nbitwiseLogicalOr\nBuiltinByteString\nbitwiseLogicalXor\nBuiltinByteString\nbitwiseLogicalComplement\nBuiltinByteString\nreadBit\nwriteBits\nreplicateByteString\nFor the binary logical operations (that is, bitwiseLogicalAnd, bitwiseLogicalOr and bitwiseLogicalXor), the we have two choices of semantics when handling BuiltinByteString arguments of different lengths. We can either produce a result whose length is the minimum of the two arguments (which we call truncation semantics), or produce a result whose length is the maximum of the two arguments (which we call padding semantics). As these can both be useful depending on context, we allow both, controlled by a BuiltinBool flag, on all the operations listed above.\nbitwiseLogicalAnd\nbitwiseLogicalOr\nbitwiseLogicalXor\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinBool\nIn cases where we have arguments of different lengths, in order to produce a result of the appropriate lengths, one of the arguments needs to be either padded or truncated. Let short and long refer to the BuiltinByteString argument of shorter length, and of longer length, respectively. The following table describes what happens to the arguments before the operation:\nshort\nlong\nBuiltinByteString\nshort\nlong\nWe pad with different bytes depending on operation: for bitwiseLogicalAnd, we pad with 0xFF, while for bitwiseLogicalOr and bitwiseLogicalXor we pad with 0x00 instead. We refer to arguments so changed as semantics-modified arguments.\nbitwiseLogicalAnd\n0xFF\nbitwiseLogicalOr\nbitwiseLogicalXor\n0x00\nFor example, consider the BuiltinByteStrings x = [0x00, 0xF0, 0xFF] and y = [0xFF, 0xF0].

At the same time, we expect that any implementation of these operations will be subject to these laws.\nbitwiseLogicalComplement\nThe main law of bitwiseLogicalComplement is involution:\nbitwiseLogicalComplement\nbitwiseLogicalComplement (bitwiseLogicalComplement x) = x\nbitwiseLogicalComplement (bitwiseLogicalComplement x) = x\nIn combination with bitwiseLogicalAnd and bitwiseLogicalOr, bitwiseLogicalComplement gives rise to the famous De Morgan laws, irrespective of semantics:\nbitwiseLogicalAnd\nbitwiseLogicalOr\nbitwiseLogicalComplement\nbitwiseLogicalComplement (bitwiseLogicalAnd s x y) = bitwiseLogicalOr s (bitwiseLogicalComplement x) (bitwiseLogicalComplement y) bitwiseLogicalComplement (bitwiseLogicalOr s x y) = bitwiseLogicalAnd s (bitwiseLogicalComplement x) (bitwiseLogicalComplement y)\nbitwiseLogicalComplement (bitwiseLogicalAnd s x y) = bitwiseLogicalOr s (bitwiseLogicalComplement x) (bitwiseLogicalComplement y) bitwiseLogicalComplement (bitwiseLogicalOr s x y) = bitwiseLogicalAnd s (bitwiseLogicalComplement x) (bitwiseLogicalComplement y)\nFor bitwiseLogicalXor, we instead have (again, irrespective of semantics):\nbitwiseLogicalXor\nbitwiseLogicalXor s x (bitwiseLogicalComplement x) = x\nbitwiseLogicalXor s x (bitwiseLogicalComplement x) = x\nThroughout, we assume any index arguments to be 'in-bounds'; that is, all the index arguments used in the statements of any law are such that the operation they are applied to wouldn't produce an error.\nThe first law of writeBits is similar to the set-twice law of lenses:\nwriteBits\nwriteBits bs [(i, b1), (i, b2)] = writeBits bs [(i, b2)]\nwriteBits bs [(i, b1), (i, b2)] = writeBits bs [(i, b2)]\nTogether with readBit, we obtain the remaining two analogues to the lens laws:\nreadBit\n-- writing to an index, then reading from that index, gets you what you wrote readBit (writeBits bs [(i, b)]) i = b -- if you read from an index, then write that value to that same index, nothing -- happens writeBits bs [(i, readBit bs i)] = bs\n-- writing to an index, then reading from that index, gets you what you wrote readBit (writeBits bs [(i, b)]) i = b -- if you read from an index, then write that value to that same index, nothing -- happens writeBits bs [(i, readBit bs i)] = bs\nFurthermore, given a fixed data argument, writeBits acts as a monoid homomorphism lists under concatenation to functions:\nwriteBits\nwriteBits bs [] = bs writeBits bs (is <> js) = writeBits (writeBits bs is) js\nwriteBits bs [] = bs writeBits bs (is <> js) = writeBits (writeBits bs is) js\nreplicateByteString\nGiven a fixed byte argument, replicateByteString acts as a monoid homomorphism from natural numbers under addition to BuiltinByteStrings under concatenation:\nreplicateByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nreplicateByteString 0 w = \"\" replicateByteString (n + m) w = replicateByteString n w <> replicateByteString m w\nreplicateByteString 0 w = \"\" replicateByteString (n + m) w = replicateByteString n w <> replicateByteString m w\nAdditionally, for any 'in-bounds' index (that is, any index for which indexByteString won't error) i, we have\nindexByteString\ni\nindexByteString (replicateByteString n w) i = w\nindexByteString (replicateByteString n w) i = w\nLastly, we have\nlengthByteString (replicateByteString n w) = n\nlengthByteString (replicateByteString n w) = n\nThe operations, and semantics, described in this CIP provide a set of well-defined bitwise logical operations, as well as bitwise access and modification, to allow cases similar to Case 1 to be performed efficiently and conveniently. Furthermore, the semantics we describe would be reasonably familiar to users of other programming languages (including Haskell) which have provisions for bitwise logical operations of this kind, as well as some way of extending these operations to operate on packed byte vectors. At the same time, there are several choices we have made that are somewhat unusual, or could potentially have been implemented differently based on existing work: most notably, our choice of bit indexing scheme, the padding-versus-truncation semantics, and the multiplicitous definition of bit modification. Among existing work, a particularly important example is CIP-58, which makes provisions for operations similar to the ones described here, and from which we differ in several important ways. We clarify the reasoning behind our choices, and how they differ from existing work, below.\nAside from the issues we list below, we don't consider other operations controversial. Indeed, bitwiseLogicalComplement has a direct parallel to the implementation in CIP-58, and replicateByteString is a direct wrapper around the replicate function in ByteString. Thus, we do not discuss them further here.\nbitwiseLogicalComplement\nreplicateByteString\nreplicate\nByteString\nOur work relates to both CIP-58 and CIP-121. Essentially, our goal with both this CIP and CIP-121 is to both break CIP-58 into more manageable (and reviewable) parts, and also address some of the design choices in CIP-58 that were not as good (or as clear) as they could have been. In this regard, this CIP is a direct continuation of CIP-121; CIP-121 dealt with conversions between BuiltinByteString and BuiltinInteger, while this CIP handles bit indexing more generally, as well as 'parallel' logical operations that operate on all the bits of a BuiltinByteString in bulk.\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nWe describe how our work in this CIP relates to (and in some cases, supercedes) CIP-58, as well as how it follows on from CIP-121, in more detail below.\nThe bit indexing scheme we describe here is designed around two considerations. Firstly, we want operations on these bits, as well as those results, to be as consistent and as predictable as possible: any individual familiar with such operations on variable-length bitvectors from another language shouldn't be surprised by the semantics. Secondly, we want to anticipate future bitwise operation extensions, such as shifts and rotations, and have the indexing scheme support efficient implementations (and predictable semantics) for these.\nWhile prior art for bit access (and modification) exists in almost any programming language, these are typically over types of fixed width (usually bytes, machine words, or something similar); for variable-width types, these typically are either not implemented at all, or if they are implemented, this is done in an external library, with varying support for certain operations. An example of the first is Haskell's ByteString, which has no way to even access, much less modify, individual bits; an example of the second is the CRoaring library for C, which supports all the operations we describe in this CIP, along with multiple others. In the second case, the exact arrangement of bits inside the representation is not something users are exposed to directly: instead, the bitvector type is opaque, and the library only guarantees consistency of API. In our case, this is not a viable choice, as we require bit access and byte access to both work on BuiltinByteString, and thus, some consistency of representation is required.\nByteString\nBuiltinByteString\nThe scheme for indexing bits within a byte that we describe in the relevant section is the same as the one used by the Data.Bits API in Haskell for Word8 bit indexing, and mirrors the decisions of most languages that provide such an API at all, as well as the conventional definition of such operations as (w i) & 1 for access, w | (1 i) for setting, and w & ~(1 i) for clearing. We could choose to 'flip' this indexing, by using a similar operation for 'index flipping' as we currently use for bytes: essentially, instead of\nData.Bits\nWord8\n(w >> i) & 1\nw | (1 << i)\nw & ~(1 << i)\nwe would instead use\nto designate bit iii as set (and analogously for clear). Together with the ability to choose not to flip the byte index, we get four possibilities, which have been described previously. For clarity, we name, and describe, them below. Throughout, we use n as the length of a given BuiltinByteString in bytes.\nn\nBuiltinByteString\nThe first possibility is that we 'flip' neither bit, nor byte, indexes. We call this the no-flip variant:\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |------------|-------------------------------|-------------------| ... |--------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) | |------------|-------------------------------|-------------------| ... |--------------------------------| | Bit index | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 15 | 14 | ... | 8 | ... | 8n - 1 | 8n - 2 | ... | 8n - 8 |\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |------------|-------------------------------|-------------------| ... |--------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) | |------------|-------------------------------|-------------------| ... |--------------------------------| | Bit index | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 15 | 14 | ... | 8 | ... | 8n - 1 | 8n - 2 | ... | 8n - 8 |\nThe second possibility is that we 'flip' both bit and byte indexes. We call this the both-flip variant:\n| Byte index | 0 | ... | n - 2 | n - 1 | |------------|--------------------------------| ... |------------------|-------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | ... | w (n - 2) | w(n - 1) | |------------|--------------------------------| ... |------------------|-------------------------------| | Bit index | 8n - 8 | 8n - 7 | ... | 8n - 1 | ... | 8 | 9 | ... | 15 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n| Byte index | 0 | ... | n - 2 | n - 1 | |------------|--------------------------------| ... |------------------|-------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | ... | w (n - 2) | w(n - 1) | |------------|--------------------------------| ... |------------------|-------------------------------| | Bit index | 8n - 8 | 8n - 7 | ... | 8n - 1 | ... | 8 | 9 | ... | 15 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\nThe third possibility is that we 'flip' bit indexes, but not byte indexes. We call this the bit-flip variant:\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |------------|-------------------------------|--------------| ... |--------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) | |------------|-------------------------------|--------------| ... |--------------------------------| | Bit index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | ... | 15 | ... | 8n - 8 | 8n - 7 | ... | 8n - 1 |\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |------------|-------------------------------|--------------| ... |--------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) | |------------|-------------------------------|--------------| ... |--------------------------------| | Bit index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | ... | 15 | ... | 8n - 8 | 8n - 7 | ... | 8n - 1 |\nThe fourth possibility is the one we describe in the bit indexing scheme section, which is also the scheme chosen by CIP-58. We repeat it below for clarity:\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |------------|--------------------------------|----| ... |-------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) | |------------|--------------------------------|----| ... |-------------------------------| | Bit index | 8n - 1 | 8n - 2 | ... | 8n - 8 | ... | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | ... | n - 1 | |------------|--------------------------------|----| ... |-------------------------------| | Byte | w0 | w1 | ... | w(n - 1) | |------------|--------------------------------|----| ... |-------------------------------| | Bit index | 8n - 1 | 8n - 2 | ... | 8n - 8 | ... | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\nOn the face of it, these schemes appear equivalent: they are all consistent, and all have formal descriptions, and quite similar ones at that. However, we believe that only the one we chose is the correct one. To explain this, we introduce two notions that we consider to be both intuitive and important, then specify why our choice of indexing scheme fits those notions better than any other.\nThe first notion is index locality. Intuitively, this states that if two indexes are 'close' (in that their absolute difference is small), the values at those indexes should be 'close' (in that their positioning in memory should be separated less). We believe this notion to be reasonable, as this is an expectation from array indexing (and indeed, BuiltinByteString indexing), as well as the reason why packed array data is efficient on modern memory hierarchies. Extending this notion to bits, we can observe that the both-flip and no-flip variants of the bit indexing scheme do not preserve index locality: the separation between a bit at index 000 and index 111 is significantly different to the separation between a bit at index 777 and index 888 in both representations, despite their absolute difference being identical. Thus, we believe that these two variants are not viable, as they are not only confusing from the point of view of behaviour, they would also make implementation of future operations (such as shifts or rotations) significantly harder to both do, and also reason about. Thus, only the bit-flip variant, as well as our choice, remain contenders.\nBuiltinByteString\nThe second notion is most-significant-first conversion agreement. This notion refers to the CIP-121 concept of the same name, and ensures that (at least for the most-significant-first arrangement), the following workflow doesn't produce unexpected results:\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nbuiltinIntegerToByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nbuiltinByteStringToInteger\nThis workflow is directly relevant to Case 2. The Argon2 family of hashes use certain inputs (which happen to be numbers) both as numbers (meaning, for arithmetic operatons) and also as blocks of binary (specifically for XOR). This is not unique to Argon2, or even hashing, as a range of operations (especially in cryptographic applications) use similar approaches, whether for performance, semantics or both. In such cases, users of our primitives (both logical and conversion) must be confident that their changes 'translate' in the way they expect between these two 'views' of the data.\nThe choice of most-significant-first as the arrangement that we must agree with seems somewhat arbitrary at a glance, for two reasons: firstly, it's not clear why we must pick a single arrangement to be consistent with; secondly, the reasoning for the choice of most-significant-first over most-significant-last as the arrangement to agree with isn't immediately apparent. To see why this is the only choice that we consider reasonable, we first observe that, according to the definition of the bit indexing scheme given in the corresponding section, as well as the corresponding definition for the bit-flip variant, we view a BuiltinByteString of length nnn as a binary natural number with exactly 8n8n8n digits, and the value at index iii corresponds to the digits whose place value is either 2i2 i2i (for the bit-flip variant), or 28n i 12 {8n - i - 1}28n i 1 (for our chosen method). Put another way, under the specification for the bit-flip variant, the least significant binary digit is first, whereas in our chosen specification, the least significant binary digit is last. CIP-121's conversion primitives mirror this reasoning: the most-significant-first arrangement corresponds to our chosen method, while the most-significant-last arrangement corresponds to the bit-flip variant instead. The difference is the digit value: for us, the digit value is (effectively) 2, while for CIP-121's conversion primitives, it is 256 instead.\nBuiltinByteString\nWe also observe that, when we index a BuiltinByteString's bytes, we get back a BuiltinInteger, whic has a numerical value as a natural number in the range [0,255][0, 255][0,255]. Putting these two observations together, we consider it sensible that, given a non-empty BuiltinByteString, if we were to get the values at bit indexes 000 through 777, then sum their corresponding place values (treating clear bits as 000 and set bits as the appropriate place value), we should get the same result as indexing whichever byte those bits came from.\nBuiltinByteString\nBuiltinInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nConsider the BuiltinByteString whose only byte is 424242, whose representation is as follows:\nBuiltinByteString\n| Byte index | 0 | |------------|----------| | Byte | 00101010 |\n| Byte index | 0 | |------------|----------| | Byte | 00101010 |\nWe note that, if we index this BuiltinByteString at byte position 000, we get back the answer 424242. Furthermore, if we use builtinByteStringToInteger from CIP-121 with such a BuiltinByteString, we get the result 424242 as well, regardless of the endianness argument we choose.\nBuiltinByteString\nbuiltinByteStringToInteger\nBuiltinByteString\nUnder the bit-flip variant, the bit indexes of this BuiltinByteString would be as follows:\nBuiltinByteString\n| Byte index | 0 | |------------|-------------------------------| | Byte | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | |------------|-------------------------------| | Bit index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n| Byte index | 0 | |------------|-------------------------------| | Byte | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | |------------|-------------------------------| | Bit index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\nHowever, we immediately see a problem: under this indexing scheme, the 22=42 2 = 422=4 place value is 111, which would suggest that in the binary representation of 424242, the corresponding digit is also 111. However, this is not the case. Under our scheme of choice however, we get the correct answer:\n| Byte index | 0 | |------------|-------------------------------| | Byte | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | |------------|-------------------------------| | Bit index | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\n| Byte index | 0 | |------------|-------------------------------| | Byte | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | |------------|-------------------------------| | Bit index | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\nHere, the 444 place value is correctly 000. This demonstrates that of the two indexing scheme possibilities that preserve index locality, only one can be consistent with any choice of byte arrangement, whether most-significant-first or most-significant-last: the one we chose. This implies that we cannot be consistent with both arrangements while also preserving index locality.\nLet us now consider a larger example BuiltinByteString:\nBuiltinByteString\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | |------------|----------|----------| | Byte | 00101010 | 11011011 |\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | |------------|----------|----------| | Byte | 00101010 | 11011011 |\nThis would produce two different results when converted with builtinByteStringToInteger, depending on the choice of endianness argument:\nbuiltinByteStringToInteger\nThese have the following 'breakdowns' in base-2:\nUnder the bit-flip variant, the bit indexes of this BuiltinByteString would be as follows:\nBuiltinByteString\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | |------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------| | Byte | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | |------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------| | Bit index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | |------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------| | Byte | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | |------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------| | Bit index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |\nWe immediately see a problem, as in this representation, it suggests that the 21=22 1 = 221=2 place value has zero digit value. This is true of neither 109751097510975 nor 571305713057130's base-2 forms, which have the 222 place value with a 111 digit value. This suggests that the bit-flip variant cannot agree with either choice of arrangement in general.\nHowever, if we view the bit indexes using our chosen scheme:\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | |------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------| | Byte | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | |------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------| | Bit index | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\n| Byte index | 0 | 1 | |------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------| | Byte | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | |------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------| | Bit index | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\nthe 222 place value is correctly shown as having a digit value of 1.\nCombining these observations, we note that, assuming we value index locality, choosing our scheme gives us consistency with the most-significant-first arrangement, as well as consistency with byte indexing digit values, but choosing the bit-flip variant gives us neither. As we need both index locality and consistency with at least one arrangement, our choice is the correct one. The fact that we also get byte indexing digit values being consistent is another reason for our choice.\nFor the operations defined in this CIP taking two Built"

  {
    "prompt": "CIP0123?",
    "completion": "We describe the semantics of a set of bitwise operations for Plutus BuiltinByteStrings. Specifically, we provide descriptions for:\nBuiltinByteString\npopcount\nWe base our work on similar operations described in CIP-58, but use the bit indexing scheme from the logical operations cip for the semantics. This is intended as follow-on work from both of these.\nBitwise operations, both over fixed-width and variable-width blocks of bits, have a range of uses. Indeed, we have already proposed CIP-122, with some example cases, and a range of primitive operations on BuiltinByteStrings designed to allow bitwise operations in the service of those example cases, as well as many others. These operations form a core of functionality, which is important and necessary, but not complete. We believe that the operations we describe in this CIP form a useful 'completion' of the work in CIP-122, based on similar work done in the earlier CIP-58.\nBuiltinByteString\nTo demonstrate why our proposed operations are useful, we re-use the cases provided in the CIP-122, and show why the operations we describe would be beneficial.\nFor integer sets, the previous description lacks two important, and useful, operations:\nThese operations have a range of uses. The first corresponds to the notion of Hamming weight, which can be used for operations ranging from representing boards in chess games to exponentiation by squaring to succinct data structures. Together with bitwise XOR, it can also compute the Hamming distance. The second operation also has a range of uses, ranging from succinct priority queues to integer normalization. It is also useful for rank-select dictionaries, a succinct structure that can act as the basis of a range of others, such as dictionaries, multisets and trees of different arity.\nIn all of the above, these operations need to be implemented efficiently to be useful. While we could use only bit reading to perform all of these, it is extremely inefficient: given an input of length nnn, assuming that any bit distribution is equally probable, we need (8 n)\\Theta(8 \\cdot n) (8 n) time in the average case. While it is impossible to do both of these operations in sub-linear time in general, the large constant factors this imposes (as well as the overhead of looping over bit indexes) is a cost we can ill afford on-chain, especially if the goal is to use these operations as 'building blocks' for something like a data structure.\nIn our previously-described case, we stated what operations we would need for the Argon2 family of hashes specifically. However, Argon2 has a specific advantage in that the number of operations it requires are both relatively few, and the most complex of which (BLAKE2b hashing) already exists in Plutus Core as a primitive. However, other hash functions (and indeed, many other cryptographic primitives) rely on two other important instructions: bit shifts and bit rotations. As an example, consider SHA512, which is an important component in several cryptographic protocols (including Ed25519 signature verification): its implementation requires both shifts and rotations to work.\nLike with Case 1, we can theoretically simulate both rotations and shifts using a combination of bit reads and bit writes to an empty BuiltinByteString. However, the cost of this is extreme: we would need to produce a list of index-value pairs of length equal to the Hamming weight of the input, only to then immediately discard it! To put this into some perspective, for an 8-byte input, performing a rotation involves allocating an expected 32 index-value pairs, using significantly more memory than the result. On-chain, we can't really afford this cost, especially in an operation intended to be used as part of larger constructions (as would be necessary here).\nBuiltinByteString\nWe describe the proposed operations in several stages. First, we give an overview of the proposed operations' signatures and costings; second, we describe the semantics of each proposed operation in detail, as well as some examples.

We also make reference to logical operations from a previous CIP as part of specifying these laws.\nbitLen bs\nbs\nsizeOfByteString bs * 8\nWe describe the laws for bitwiseShift and bitwiseRotate together, as they are similar. Firstly, we observe that bitwiseShift and bitwiseRotate both form a monoid homomorphism between natural number addition and function composition:\nbitwiseShift\nbitwiseRotate\nbitwiseShift\nbitwiseRotate\nbitwiseShift bs 0 = bitwiseRotate bs 0 = bs bitwiseShift bs (i + j) = bitwiseShift (bitwiseShift bs i) j bitwiseRotate bs (i + j) = bitwiseRotate (bitwiseRotate bs i) j\nbitwiseShift bs 0 = bitwiseRotate bs 0 = bs bitwiseShift bs (i + j) = bitwiseShift (bitwiseShift bs i) j bitwiseRotate bs (i + j) = bitwiseRotate (bitwiseRotate bs i) j\nHowever, bitwiseRotate's homomorphism is between integer addition and function composition: namely, i and j in the above law are allowed to have different signs. bitwiseShift's composition law only holds if i and j don't have opposite signs: that is, if they're either both non-negative or both non-positive.\nbitwiseRotate\ni\nj\nbitwiseShift\ni\nj\nShifts by more than the number of bits in the data argument produce an empty BuiltinByteString:\nBuiltinByteString\n-- n is non-negative bitwiseShift bs (bitLen bs + n) = bitwiseShift bs (- (bitLen bs + n)) = replicateByteString (sizeOfByteString bs) 0x00\n-- n is non-negative bitwiseShift bs (bitLen bs + n) = bitwiseShift bs (- (bitLen bs + n)) = replicateByteString (sizeOfByteString bs) 0x00\nRotations, on the other hand, exhibit 'modular roll-over':\n-- n is non-negative bitwiseRotate bs (binLen bs + n) = bitwiseRotate bs n bitwiseRotate bs (- (bitLen bs + n)) = bitwiseRotate bs (- n)\n-- n is non-negative bitwiseRotate bs (binLen bs + n) = bitwiseRotate bs n bitwiseRotate bs (- (bitLen bs + n)) = bitwiseRotate bs (- n)\nShifts clear bits at low indexes if the shift argument is positive, and at high indexes if the shift argument is negative:\n-- 0 < n < bitLen bs, and 0 <= i < n readBit (bitwiseShift bs n) i = False readBit (bitwiseShift bs (- n)) (bitLen bs - i - 1) = False\n-- 0 < n < bitLen bs, and 0 <= i < n readBit (bitwiseShift bs n) i = False readBit (bitwiseShift bs (- n)) (bitLen bs - i - 1) = False\nRotations instead preserve all set and clear bits, but move them around:\n-- 0 <= i < bitLen bs readBit bs i = readBit (bitwiseRotate bs j) (modInteger (i + j) (bitLen bs))\n-- 0 <= i < bitLen bs readBit bs i = readBit (bitwiseRotate bs j) (modInteger (i + j) (bitLen bs))\ncountSetBits\ncountSetBits forms a monoid homomorphism between BuiltinByteString concatenation and natural number addition:\ncountSetBits\nBuiltinByteString\ncountSetBits \"\" = 0 countSetBits (x <> y) = countSetBits x + countSetBits y\ncountSetBits \"\" = 0 countSetBits (x <> y) = countSetBits x + countSetBits y\ncountSetBits also demonstrates that bitwiseRotate indeed preserves the number of set (and thus clear) bits:\ncountSetBits\nbitwiseRotate\ncountSetBits bs = countSetBits (bitwiseRotate bs i)\ncountSetBits bs = countSetBits (bitwiseRotate bs i)\nThere is also a relationship between the result of countSetBits on a given argument and its complement:\ncountSetBits\ncountSetBits bs = bitLen bs - countSetBits (bitwiseLogicalComplement bs)\ncountSetBits bs = bitLen bs - countSetBits (bitwiseLogicalComplement bs)\nFurthermore, countSetBits exhibits (or more precisely, gives evidence for) the inclusion-exclusion principle from combinatorics, but only under truncation semantics:\ncountSetBits\ncountSetBits (bitwiseLogicalXor False x y) = countSetBits (bitwiseLogicalOr False x y) - countSetBits (bitwiseLogicalAnd False x y)\ncountSetBits (bitwiseLogicalXor False x y) = countSetBits (bitwiseLogicalOr False x y) - countSetBits (bitwiseLogicalAnd False x y)\nLastly, countSetBits has a relationship to bitwise XOR, regardless of semantics:\ncountSetBits\ncountSetBits (bitwiseLogicalXor semantics x x) = 0\ncountSetBits (bitwiseLogicalXor semantics x x) = 0\nfindFirstSetBit\nBuiltinByteStrings where every byte is the same (provided they are not empty) have the same first bit as a singleton of that same byte:\nBuiltinByteString\n-- 0 <= w8 <= 255, n >= 1 findFirstSetBit (replicateByteString n w8) = findFirstSetBit (replicateByteString 1 w8)\n-- 0 <= w8 <= 255, n >= 1 findFirstSetBit (replicateByteString n w8) = findFirstSetBit (replicateByteString 1 w8)\nAdditionally, findFirstSet has a relationship to bitwise XOR, regardless of semantics:\nfindFirstSet\nfindFirstSetBit (bitwiseLogicalXor semantics x x) = -1\nfindFirstSetBit (bitwiseLogicalXor semantics x x) = -1\nAny result of a findFirstSetBit operation that isn't -1 gives a valid bit index to a set bit, but any non-negative BuiltinInteger less than this will give an index to a clear bit:\nfindFirstSetBit\n-1\nBuiltinInteger\n-- bs is not all zero bytes or empty readBit bs (findFirstSetBit bs) = True -- 0 <= i < findFirstSet bs readBit bs i = False\n-- bs is not all zero bytes or empty readBit bs (findFirstSetBit bs) = True -- 0 <= i < findFirstSet bs readBit bs i = False\nOur four operations, along with their semantics, fulfil the requirements of both our cases, and are law-abiding, familiar, consistent and straightforward to implement. Furthermore, they relate directly to operations provided by CIP-122, as well as being identical to the equivalent operations in CIP-58. At the same time, some alternative choices could have been made:\nfindFirstSetBit\n-1\nWe discuss our choices with regards to all the above, and specify why we made the choices that we did.\nWhile we chose to provide all of these operations as primitives, we could instead have required higher-level APIs to provide these on the basis of CIP-122 bit reads and writes. This is indeed possible:\nbitwiseShift\nbitwiseRotate\nBuiltinByteString\ncountSetBits\nfindFirstSetBit\nHowever, especially for bitwiseShift and bitwiseRotate, this comes at significant cost. For shifts and rotations, we have to construct a change list argument whose length is proportional to the Hamming weight of the data argument. Assuming that all inputs are equally likely, this is proportional to the bit length of the data argument: such a change list is likely significantly larger than the result of the shift or rotation, making the memory cost of such operations far higher than it needs to be. Given the constraints on memory and execution time on-chain, at minimum, these two operations would have to be primitives to make them viable at all: Case 2-style implementations would have intolerably large memory costs otherwise, as such algorithms often make heavy use of both shifts and rotations.\nbitwiseShift\nbitwiseRotate\nThe case for countSetBits and findFirstSetBit is less clear here, as they wouldn't require nearly as much of a memory cost if implemented atop CIP-122 primitives using folds. However, the cost would still be significant: countSetBits requires looping over every bit index in the argument, and findFirstSetBit (again, assuming any bit distribution in an argument is equally probable) requires looping over about half this many. This would make these operations unreasonable even over smaller inputs, which would make applications like rank-select dictionaries (which expect these operations to be fast and low-cost) unworkable. As succinct data structures are foremost in our minds when considering the current primitives, we believe it is important that countSetBits and findFirstSetBit are as efficient as they could be, hence their inclusion.\ncountSetBits\nfindFirstSetBit\ncountSetBits\nfindFirstSetBit\ncountSetBits\nfindFirstSetBit\nWhen designing our operations, we tried to keep them familiar to Haskellers, namely by having them behave like the similar operations from the Bits and FiniteBits type classes. In particular, bitwiseShift and bitwiseRotate act similarly given the same shift (or rotation) argument, as positive values shift left and negative ones shift right. The only exception is the choice for findFirstSetBit to return -1 when no set bits are found, which runs counter to the way countTrailingZeros from FiniteBits works, which instead returns the bit length. This is also different to how this operations works in hardware. Indeed, having findFirstSetBit work this way would not only be more familiar, it would also provide additional laws:\nBits\nFiniteBits\nbitwiseShift\nbitwiseRotate\nfindFirstSetBit\n-1\ncountTrailingZeros\nFiniteBits\nfindFirstSetBit\n-- Not possible under our current definition -- bitLen is the bit length of the argument 0 <= popcount bs <= bitLen bs - findFirstSet bs\n-- Not possible under our current definition -- bitLen is the bit length of the argument 0 <= popcount bs <= bitLen bs - findFirstSet bs\nUnder both definitions, the intent is the same: if the argument doesn't contain any set bits, produce an invalid index. The difference is that we choose to produce a negative invalid index, whereas the consensus is to produce a non-negative invalid index instead. However, one task that is likely to come up frequently when using findFirstSetBit is checking whether the index we were given was valid or not (essentially, whether the argument has any nonzero bytes in it). Under our definition, all that would be required is\nfindFirstSetBit\nlet found = findFirstSetBit bs in if found < 0 then weMissed else validIndex\nlet found = findFirstSetBit bs in if found < 0 then weMissed else validIndex\nThis is a cheap operation in Plutus Core, requiring only comparing against a constant. However, if we used the more widely-used definition, we would instead have to do this:\nlet found = findFirstSetBit bs bitLen = 8 * sizeOfByteString bs in if found >= bitLen then weMissed else validIndex\nlet found = findFirstSetBit bs bitLen = 8 * sizeOfByteString bs in if found >= bitLen then weMissed else validIndex\nThis requires us to do considerably more work (finding the length of the argument, multiplying by 8, then compare against that result), and is also much more prone to error: users have to remember to use a = comparison, as well as to multiply the argument length by 8. This is less of an issue with implementations of this operation in other languages, as their equivalent operations are designed for fixed-width arguments (indeed, FiniteBits requires this), which makes their bit length a constant. In our case, this isn't as simple, as BuiltinByteStrings have variable length, which would make the cost described above unavoidable. Our solution is both more efficient and less error-prone: all a user needs to remember is that invalid indexes from findFirstSetBit are negative. On this basis, we decided to vary from conventional approaches.\n>=\nFiniteBits\nBuiltinByteString\nfindFirstSetBit\nOne notable omission from our operators is the equivalent of counting leading zeroes: namely, an operation that would find the last set bit. Typically, both a count of leading and trailing zeroes is provided in both hardware and software: this is the case for FiniteBits, as well as most hardware implementations. To relate this to our cases, specifically Case 1, this would allow us to efficiently find the largest element in an integer set. The reason we omit this operation is because, when compared with counting trailing zeroes, it is far less useful: while it can be used for computing fast integer square roots, it lacks many other uses. Counting trailing zeroes, on the other hand, is essential for rank-select dictionaries (specifically for the select operation), and also enables a range of other uses, which we have already mentioned. In order to limit the number of new primitives, we decided that counting leading zeroes can be omitted for now. However, our design doesn't preclude such an operation from being added later if a use case for it is found to be useful.\nFiniteBits\nselect\nWe consider the following criteria to be essential for acceptance:\nIdeally, the implementation should also demonstrate its performance characteristics by well-designed benchmarks.\nMLabs has begun the implementation of the proof-of-concept as required in the acceptance criteria. Upon completion, we will send a pull request to Plutus with the implementation of the primitives for Plutus Core, mirroring the proof-of-concept.\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

Preserving the input ordering from a submitted transaction enables a validator to efficiently identify the required inputs in accordance with its validation logic, thus eliminating the need to use unnecessary computation by traversing all transaction inputs or performing sorting within the validator itself.\nFurthermore, this implementation offers the potential to enhance existing design patterns already used in production, specifically by improving the ability to group and match inputs and outputs located at the specific index positions.\nAccording to the Babbage CDDL transaction_body , the inputs and reference inputs of a transaction body are represented as a set, which indicates the non-duplicate inputs. However, the ledger not only process the transaction_inputs as a set , but also orders them lexicographically, first by transaction_id and then by index.\ntransaction_id\nindex\nThe primary issue with the ledger ordering inputs lexicographically is that validators must traverse all the inputs or sort them within the validator to find the required inputs for the validation logic. This process can lead to inefficiencies and increases the risk of exceeding the execution budget specially when processing a large set of inputs.\nFor instance, consider a spending validator that needs to access its own input and output. Each function described below necessitates traversing all inputs and outputs to fulfill such validation:\nfindOwnInput :: ScriptContext -> Maybe TxInInfo findOwnInput ScriptContext{scriptContextTxInfo=TxInfo{txInfoInputs}, scriptContextPurpose=Spending txOutRef} = find (\\TxInInfo{txInInfoOutRef} -> txInInfoOutRef == txOutRef) txInfoInputs findOwnInput _ = Nothing\nfindOwnInput :: ScriptContext -> Maybe TxInInfo findOwnInput ScriptContext{scriptContextTxInfo=TxInfo{txInfoInputs}, scriptContextPurpose=Spending txOutRef} = find (\\TxInInfo{txInInfoOutRef} -> txInInfoOutRef == txOutRef) txInfoInputs findOwnInput _ = Nothing\ngetContinuingOutputs :: ScriptContext -> [TxOut] getContinuingOutputs ctx | Just TxInInfo{txInInfoResolved=TxOut{txOutAddress}} <- findOwnInput ctx = filter (f txOutAddress) (txInfoOutputs $ scriptContextTxInfo ctx) where f addr TxOut{txOutAddress=otherAddress} = addr == otherAddress getContinuingOutputs _ = traceError \"Lf\" -- \"Can't get any continuing outputs\"\ngetContinuingOutputs :: ScriptContext -> [TxOut] getContinuingOutputs ctx | Just TxInInfo{txInInfoResolved=TxOut{txOutAddress}} <- findOwnInput ctx = filter (f txOutAddress) (txInfoOutputs $ scriptContextTxInfo ctx) where f addr TxOut{txOutAddress=otherAddress} = addr == otherAddress getContinuingOutputs _ = traceError \"Lf\" -- \"Can't get any continuing outputs\"\nvalidatorA :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> Bool validatorA _datum _redeemer context = validateWithInputOutput input output where Just (TxInInfo {txInInfoResolved = input}) = findOwnInput context [output] = getContinuingOutputs context validateWithInputOutput _ _ = True\nvalidatorA :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> Bool validatorA _datum _redeemer context = validateWithInputOutput input output where Just (TxInInfo {txInInfoResolved = input}) = findOwnInput context [output] = getContinuingOutputs context validateWithInputOutput _ _ = True\nFurthermore, preserving the order of inputs from the submitted transaction will facilitate the utilization of index redeemer patterns that many projects are transitioning to, as illustrated below.\nvalidatorIndex :: BuiltinData -> Integer -> ScriptContext -> Bool validatorIndex _datum index ScriptContext {scriptContextTxInfo = txInfo, scriptContextPurpose = Spending txOutRef} = validateInputOutput input output && txOutRef == intxOutRef where inputs = txInfoInputs txInfo outputs = txInfoOutputs txInfo TxInInfo {txInInfoOutRef = intxOutRef, txInInfoResolved = input} = inputs P.!! index output = outputs P.!! index validateWithInputOutput _ _ = True\nvalidatorIndex :: BuiltinData -> Integer -> ScriptContext -> Bool validatorIndex _datum index ScriptContext {scriptContextTxInfo = txInfo, scriptContextPurpose = Spending txOutRef} = validateInputOutput input output && txOutRef == intxOutRef where inputs = txInfoInputs txInfo outputs = txInfoOutputs txInfo TxInInfo {txInInfoOutRef = intxOutRef, txInInfoResolved = input} = inputs P.!! index output = outputs P.!! index validateWithInputOutput _ _ = True\nGiven the deterministic nature of the extended UTXO model, the determination of inputs and outputs can already be achieved through the off-chain code, eliminating the necessity to find or traverse inputs and outputs within the validator.\nAs per protocol specifications, the transaction body is structured as follows:\ntransaction_body = { 0 : set<transaction_input> ; inputs , 1 : [* transaction_output] , 2 : coin ; fee , ?

    "completion": "This Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) defines a standardized structure for encoding and representing various governance and credential identifiers, specifically designed for DRep, Constitutional Committee (CC) keys, and Governance Actions within the Conway era. This specification introduces a single-byte header that encapsulates metadata related to the key type and credential type, allowing identifiers to retain critical metadata even when stored as byte arrays. By encoding this metadata directly into the bech32 format, we enhance both usability and interoperability across Cardano infrastructure and tools.\nThe Conway era on Cardano introduces new governance features, requiring unique and identifiable credentials for roles such as DReps, Constitutional Committee members, and distinct governance actions. Existing infrastructure and tools that process bech32 identifiers often decode and store the raw byte data for efficiency, unintentionally stripping away the metadata embedded in the bech32 prefix. This CIP addresses that limitation by embedding metadata into a structured single-byte header, allowing credentials to be stored in byte form without losing essential metadata. This standardization facilitates seamless linkage, sharing, and compatibility of governance identifiers across the ecosystem, supporting a robust and interoperable governance framework in Cardano.\nWe define a bytes representation for the various credentials and identifiers along with the their bech32 prefixes in this CIP. Taking inspiration from the Cardano addresses bytes format, we define an 8 bit header and a payload to define the key, which look similar to the reward address byte format but with a new specification and using the governance credentials.\nIn this CIP, We also define a simple bech32 prefix for gov actions, which does not have a credential. Gov actions only contain transaction ID bytes and an index, defined in the Gov Action Section below. The chosen prefixes for each identifier align with Cardano's established naming convention used in ledger specification, ensuring easy recognition and minimizing confusion within the ecosystem.\nIn the header-byte, bits [7;4] indicate the type of gov key being used. The remaining four bits [3;0] are used to define the credential type. There are currently 3 types of credentials defined in the Cardano Conway era, this specification will allow us to define a maximum of 16 different types of keys in the future.\n1 byte variable length <------> <-------------------> ┌────────┬─────────────────────┐ │ header │ key │ └────────┴─────────────────────┘ 🔎 ╎ 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ╎ ┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐ ╰╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌ |t│t│t│t│c│c│c│c│ └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘\n1 byte variable length <------> <-------------------> ┌────────┬─────────────────────┐ │ header │ key │ └────────┴─────────────────────┘ 🔎 ╎ 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 ╎ ┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐ ╰╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌ |t│t│t│t│c│c│c│c│ └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘\nThere are currently 3 types of governance keys, and it is defined using the first half (bits [7;4]) of the header.

By defining a single-byte header that includes both key type and credential type, the proposal provides a consistent, compact format that retains crucial metadata even when stored or transmitted as raw byte arrays. This specification is designed to be forward-compatible, with a capacity to support up to 16 key types, allowing it to evolve with Cardano s governance and credential requirements.\nThis approach aligns with existing Cardano address encoding practices while adding specificity for governance keys in the Conway era. By also defining distinct bech32 prefixes for each identifier type, the CIP enhances user-friendliness and makes it easier for tooling and infrastructure to recognize, validate, and link these identifiers within the ecosystem. This design ensures governance identifiers are not only interoperable across platforms but also intuitive and accessible, paving the way for streamlined governance interactions within Cardano s tooling and community.\nTools, Wallets, and Explorers to utilize the identifiers and bech32 prefixes defined in this CIP for communication and view purposes.\nThis CIP uses some bech32 prefixes which are already defined by CIP105 and ref by CIP005, This PR includes updates to both the CIPs with updated vector spec. The suggested changes align with the design of the original CIP005.\nFor key generation tools - To move faster to this CIP, current tools which implement CIP105 based bech32 prefixes do not have to implement this CIP specification. They can change the prefix according to the updates suggested in this CIP, updating bech32 prefix will be a find and replace sort of an updated and it will instantly become compatible with this CIP.\nTools like explorers and wallets - These tools can potentially support both formats to start with for the purpose of allowing users to search for drep, cold keys, hot keys as these 3 are impacted by this CIP upgrade. And can continue to show only this CIP specification, having an easy backward compatibility as well moving to this CIP standard.\nThis CIP does not require a hard fork for implementation, the goal is to use the identifies specified in this CIP for the UI, and as a medium of communication for sharing such keys and IDs.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "The CIP proposes an extension of the current Plutus functions to provide support for the efficient computation of the multi-scalar multiplication over the BLS12-381 curve. This operation is crucial in a number of cryptographic protocols that can enhance the capabilities of the Cardano blockchain.\nMulti-scalar multiplication (MSM) is an algebraic group operation of the following form. Let GGG be a group of prime order ppp. Let g0,g1,...,gN 1g_0, g_1, ..., g_{N-1}g0 ,g1 ,...,gN 1 be elements of GGG and let e0,e1,...,eN 1e_0, e_1, ..., e_{N-1}e0 ,e1 ,...,eN 1 be elements of ZpZ_pZp . Then, the multi-scalar multiplication MMM is calculated as M= i=0N 1ei giM=\\sum_{i=0} {N-1} e_i \\cdot g_iM= i=0N 1 ei gi .\nThis operation appears in many cryptographic protocols. Its naive implementation requires NNN scalar multiplications and NNN group additions. However, the performance can be significantly improved by employing advanced algorithms, such as the Pippenger Approach. Moreover, it can be further optimized for a particular group type (e.g., for elliptic curve groups [BH22, L23]).\nMulti-scalar multiplication appears in various cryptographic protocols, such as cryptographic signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, SNARK systems, and others. It is especially important in elliptic-curve-based SNARK proof systems, where large-scale MSMs can become a bottleneck in both proving and verification algorithms.\nThe recent Chang upgrade in Cardano included CIP-0381, which introduced built-in support for operations over the BLS12-381 elliptic curve (the implementation uses blst library). It made it feasible to implement various SNARK systems on-chain in Cardano. However, MSM still remains a bottleneck for many use cases. Implementing MSM naively, even using built-in functions for BLS12-381, consumes a significant portion of the computational budget of a transaction. It hinders implementation of such SNARK systems as KZG-based PLONK or Groth16, which require computations of MSM.\nOur benchmarks show that MSM of 10 G1G1G1 points over BLS12-381 curve consumes 7.74 of the computational budget of a transaction, while MSM of size more than 129 cannot fit into a single transaction at all. It impedes verification of complex circuits which might require much larger MSM.\nWe also did preliminary benchmarks to compare an optimized blst implementation of MSM with naive implementation using just blst group operations. We used Rust bindings to do these benchmarks (the underlying bindings are the same as used in cardano-base for bslt, which means we can expect similar behavior for the Haskell stack). The results for G1 group are the following (more results in the repository):\n* the sudden time improvement after 32 points is attributed to the inner workings of the blst library, which may operate differently for the MSM of size less than 32 (this should be carefully analyzed when establishing costing function for MSM built-in).\nAs it can be seen the performance improvement rises quickly with the size of the MSM. Note that the current threshold for Plutus naive implementation is 129 points per transaction. Our blst benchmarks show that naive MSM of size 129 takes approximately the same time as optimized MSM for more than 4000 points, which gives a hint to what improvements we can expect with a Plutus built-in for MSM. Moreover, these benchmarks do not account for the Plutus overhead to call many built-in BLS12 functions while implementing the naive MSM, so the final improvement may be even larger. On the other hand, it is important to mention that if those points are brought into the script as input, their number would be constrained by the size of the script and by the computational complexity of points decompression. The benchmarks of points decompression in CIP-0381 shows that up to 300 G1 points can be passed as input to a 16kb script. However, in real cryptographic protocols typically only a part of the points involved in MSM is passed as input, while another part is computed during the execution (e.g., in PLONK-based SNARKs).\nThe availability of MSM built-in function in Plutus language will provide more efficient and reliable means to perform this important computation. Implementing an optimized MSM manually in Plutus deemed to be infeasible because of its complexity and because it operates at the level of basic curve operations.\nA nonexclusive list of cryptographic protocols that would benefit from having MSM built-in for BLS12-381 curve:\nThe above mentioned cryptographic protocols are used in many Cardano products, for instance:\nIn conclusion, integrating multi-scalar multiplication as a core built-in within Plutus is not only essential for enhancing cryptographic capabilities, but also for optimizing on-chain computations. The current approach of naive manual implementation in Plutus is inefficient for large-scale MSMs. Incorporating this function directly will streamline these operations, reduce transaction costs, and maintain the integrity of existing tools, thereby significantly advancing the Plutus ecosystem's functionality and user experience.\nThe MSM for BLS12-381 is implemented in blst library, which is already a dependency for the cardano-base. This library provides efficient and formally verified implementation of operations over the BLS12-381 elliptic curve. It has been used for implementing CIP-0381. Basically, we would like to expose several additional functions from this library in Plutus API.\nWe propose to define two new Plutus functions bls12_381_G1_multiScalarMul and bls12_381_G2_multiScalarMul as follows:\nbls12_381_G1_multiScalarMul :: [Integer] -> [bls12_381_G1_element] -> bls12_381_G1_element bls12_381_G2_multiScalarMul :: [Integer] -> [bls12_381_G2_element] -> bls12_381_G2_element\nbls12_381_G1_multiScalarMul :: [Integer] -> [bls12_381_G1_element] -> bls12_381_G1_element bls12_381_G2_multiScalarMul :: [Integer] -> [bls12_381_G2_element] -> bls12_381_G2_element\nThe types bls12_381_G1_element and bls12_381_G2_element are already introduced by CIP-0381. Given two arrays of scalars and group elements the functions compute multi-scalar multiplication for the corresponding subgroup. The arrays of scalars and group elements must be non-empty and of equal size. If the input arrays are empty or not equal, the functions must fail. These new functions naturally extend a set of operations over BLS12-381 defined by CIP-0381.\nThe computational impact of multi-scalar multiplication is complicated by it having dynamic-size arguments. Preliminary benchmarks show that the computational complexity grows linearly with the size of the MSM. This should be reflected in the costing function. It should also be taken into account that the efficiency of the MSM algorithm may vary depending on the blst setup.\nThere may be an extra complication in the costing procedure because all scalars have to be reduced modulo the order of the group before being passed to the blst functions (this happens here for the existing BLS12-381 scalar multiplication function in cardano-crypto-class). Presumably this is almost zero-cost for scalars already in the correct range, but if we pass in a very long list of very large scalars, the aggregated reduction time might be quite significant, and this must be taken into account in the costing function to guard against the possibility of a large amount of computation being done too cheaply.\ncardano-crypto-class\nIntegrating these functions directly into Plutus will streamline cryptographic operations, reduce transaction costs, and uphold the integrity of existing cryptographic interfaces. It addresses current inefficiencies and enhances the cryptographic capabilities of the Plutus platform.\nIt will allow the implementation of complex cryptographic protocols on-chain in Plutus smart contracts, significantly expanding the capabilities of the Cardano blockchain.\nWe consider the following criteria to be essential for acceptance:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

CIP-0013 does not define a method for stake or dRep addresses, etc., to be encoded in the URI scheme it defines.\nAllowing these addresses to be easily encoded as URIs allows them to be 100 interoperable with existing public key infrastructure and certificate creation tools.\nWe extend CIP-0013 with a single new authority for referencing Cardano addresses in CIP-0019 format.\nWe extend the grammar from CIP-0013 with the new authority:\nauthorityref = (... | addr ) addr = \"//addr/\" cip19-addr cip19-addr = *cip19-char cip19-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"_\"\nauthorityref = (... | addr ) addr = \"//addr/\" cip19-addr cip19-addr = *cip19-char cip19-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"_\"\nEffectively, any address string specified by CIP-0019, CIP-0105 or future extension to either of these specifications can be embedded directly within the URI.\nweb+cardano://addr/addr1qx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer3n0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgse35a3x web+cardano://addr/addr_test1gz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer5pnz75xxcrdw5vky web+cardano://addr/stake1uyehkck0lajq8gr28t9uxnuvgcqrc6070x3k9r8048z8y5gh6ffgw web+cardano://addr/stake_test1uqehkck0lajq8gr28t9uxnuvgcqrc6070x3k9r8048z8y5gssrtvn\nweb+cardano://addr/addr1qx2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer3n0d3vllmyqwsx5wktcd8cc3sq835lu7drv2xwl2wywfgse35a3x web+cardano://addr/addr_test1gz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzer5pnz75xxcrdw5vky web+cardano://addr/stake1uyehkck0lajq8gr28t9uxnuvgcqrc6070x3k9r8048z8y5gh6ffgw web+cardano://addr/stake_test1uqehkck0lajq8gr28t9uxnuvgcqrc6070x3k9r8048z8y5gssrtvn\nweb+cardano://addr/drep_vk17axh4sc9zwkpsft3tlgpjemfwc0u5mnld80r85zw7zdqcst6w54sdv4a4e web+cardano://addr/drep15k6929drl7xt0spvudgcxndryn4kmlzpk4meed0xhqe25nle07s web+cardano://addr/drep_script16pjhzfkm7rqntfezfkgu5p50t0mkntmdruwlp089zu8v29l95rg web+cardano://addr/cc_cold_vk149up407pvp9p36lldlp4qckqqzn6vm7u5yerwy8d8rqalse3t04q7qsvwl web+cardano://addr/cc_cold1lmaet9hdvu9d9jvh34u0un4ndw3yewaq5ch6fnwsctw02xxwylj web+cardano://addr/cc_cold_script14ehj5f64f40xju0086fnunctulkh46mq7munm7upe4hpcwpcat web+cardano://addr/cc_cold_script14ehj5f64f40xju0086fnunctulkh46mq7munm7upe4hpcwpcatv web+cardano://addr/cc_hot_vk10y48lq72hypxraew74lwjjn9e2dscuwphckglh2nrrpkgweqk5hschnzv5 web+cardano://addr/cc_hot17mffcrm3vnfhvyxt7ea3y65e804jfgrk6pjn78aqd9vg7xpq8dv web+cardano://addr/cc_hot_script16fayy2wf9myfvxmtl5e2suuqmnhy5zx80vxkezen7xqwskncf40\nweb+cardano://addr/drep_vk17axh4sc9zwkpsft3tlgpjemfwc0u5mnld80r85zw7zdqcst6w54sdv4a4e web+cardano://addr/drep15k6929drl7xt0spvudgcxndryn4kmlzpk4meed0xhqe25nle07s web+cardano://addr/drep_script16pjhzfkm7rqntfezfkgu5p50t0mkntmdruwlp089zu8v29l95rg web+cardano://addr/cc_cold_vk149up407pvp9p36lldlp4qckqqzn6vm7u5yerwy8d8rqalse3t04q7qsvwl web+cardano://addr/cc_cold1lmaet9hdvu9d9jvh34u0un4ndw3yewaq5ch6fnwsctw02xxwylj web+cardano://addr/cc_cold_script14ehj5f64f40xju0086fnunctulkh46mq7munm7upe4hpcwpcat web+cardano://addr/cc_cold_script14ehj5f64f40xju0086fnunctulkh46mq7munm7upe4hpcwpcatv web+cardano://addr/cc_hot_vk10y48lq72hypxraew74lwjjn9e2dscuwphckglh2nrrpkgweqk5hschnzv5 web+cardano://addr/cc_hot17mffcrm3vnfhvyxt7ea3y65e804jfgrk6pjn78aqd9vg7xpq8dv web+cardano://addr/cc_hot_script16fayy2wf9myfvxmtl5e2suuqmnhy5zx80vxkezen7xqwskncf40\nBy extending CIP-0013 to allow a CIP-0019 encoded address to be simply embedded in the URI scheme, we enable existing certificate creation tools and public key infrastructure to be used to easily create certificates that reference Cardano addresses.\nIt is envisioned that this extension could have use cases beyond the one presented here.\nProject Catalyst intends to use this standard to facilitate linking of on-chain and off-chain identity with x509 certificates.

    "completion": "While the Cardano mainnet and other networks have proven to be highly resilient, it is necessary to proactively consider the possible recovery mechanisms and procedures that may be required in the unlikely event of a major failure where the network is unable to recover itself.\nThis CIP considers three representative scenarios and addresses specific considerations relevant in each case:\nScenario 1 - Long-Lived Network Partition Scenario 2 - Failure to Make Blocks for an Extended Period of Time Scenario 3 - Bad Blocks Minted on Chain\nTo ensure successful recovery in the event of a chain failure, it's crucial to establish effective communication channels and exercise recovery procedures in advance to familiarize the community and stake pool operators (SPOs) with the process.\nThis CIP is based on an earlier IOHK technical report that is referenced below, supplemented by internal documentation and discussions that have not been publicly released. It should be considered to be a living document that is reviewed and revised on a regular basis.\nNote that although the focus of disaster recovery is on Cardano mainnet, since this is the greatest risk of loss of funds, the recovery procedures are generic and apply to other Cardano networks, including SanchoNet, Preview, PreProd or private networks. Appropriate adjustments may need to be made to reflect differences in timing or other concerns.\nThis CIP is needed to familiarize stakeholders with the processes and procedures that should be followed in the unlikely event that the Cardano mainnet, or another Cardano network, encounters a situation where the built-in on-chain recovery mechanisms fail.\nWhile the exact recovery process will depend on the unique nature of the failure, there are three main scenarios we can consider.\nOuroboros Praos is designed to cope with real-world networking conditions, in which some nodes may temporarily be disconnected from the network. In this case, the network will continue to make blocks, perhaps at some lower chain density (reflecting the temporary loss of stake to the network as a whole). As nodes rejoin the network, they will then participate in normal block production once again. In this way, the network remains resilient to changes in connectivity.\nIf many nodes become disconnected, the network could divide into two or more completely disconnected parts. Each part of the network could then form its own chain, backed by the stake that is participating in its own partition. Under normal conditions, Praos will also deal with this situation. When the partitioned group of nodes reconnects, the longest chain will dominate, and the shorter chain will be discarded. The nodes on the shorter chain will automatically rollback to the point where the fork occurred, and then rejoin the main chain. This is perfectly normal. Such forks will typically last only a few blocks.\nHowever, in an extreme situation, the partition may persist beyond the Praos rollback limit of k blocks (currently 2,160 blocks on mainnet). In this case, the nodes will not be able to rollback to rejoin the main chain, since this would violate the required Praos guarantees.\nDisconnected nodes must be reconnected to the main chain by their operators. This can be done by truncating the local block database to a point before the chain fork and then resyncing against the main network, using the db-truncator tool, for example.\ndb-truncator\nFull node wallets can also be recovered in the same way, though this may require technical skills that the end users do not possess. It may be easier, if slower, for them to simply resynchronize their nodes from the start of the chain (i.e. from the genesis block).\nOuroboros Genesis provides additional resilience when recovering from long lived network partitions. In Praos nodes resyncing from a point before the chain fork could still in some cases follow the alternative chain (if it is the first one seen) and extra mechanisms may be needed to avoid this possibility. In Praos, for example, this may require that all participants on the alternative chain truncate the local block database prior to the partition being resolved. In Ouroboros Genesis when resyncing from a point before the chain fork, the chain selection rules will ensure selection of the correct path for the main chain assuming the partition has been resolved.\nAlternative methods to resynchronise the node to the main chain might include the use of Mithril or other signed snapshots. These would allow faster recovery. However, in this case, care needs to be taken to achieve the correct balance of trust against speed of recovery.\nAlthough block producing nodes will rejoin the main network following the remediation described above, the blocks that they have minted while they were disconnected will not be included in the main chain. This may have real world effects that will not be automatically remedied when the nodes rejoin the main chain. For example, transactions may have been processed that have significant real world value, or assumptions may have been made about chains of evidence/validity, or the timing of transactions. End users should be aware of the possibility and include provisions in their contracts to cover this eventuality. It may be necessary to resubmit some or all of the transactions that were processed on the minority chain onto the main chain. To avoid unexpected effects, this should be done by the end users/applications, and not by block producers acting on their behalf.\nIf they are not observant, stake pools, full node wallets and other node users (e.g. explorers) could continue indefinitely on the minority chain. Such users should take care to be aware of this situation and take steps to rejoin the main chain as quickly as possible. A reliable and trusted public warning system should be considered that can alert users and advise them on how to rejoin the main chain.\nOn Cardano mainnet, partitions of less than 2,160 blocks will automatically rejoin the main chain. With current Cardano mainnet settings, this represents a period of up to 12 hours during which automatic rollback will occur. If the partition exceeds 2,160 blocks, then the procedure described above will be necessary to allow nodes to rejoin the main chain. Other Cardano networks may have different timing characteristics.\nOuroboros Praos requires at least one block to be produced every 3k/f slots. With the current Cardano mainnet settings, that is a 36 hour period. Such an event is extremely unlikely, but if it were to happen then the network would be unable to make any further blocks.\nIt is recommended to monitor the chain for block production. If a low density period is observed, then block producers should be notified, and efforts made to mint new blocks prior to the expiry of the 3k/f window. If this is not possible then the remediation procedures should be followed.\nIdentify a small group of block producing nodes that will be used to recover the chain. For Cardano mainnet, this group should have sufficient delegated stake to be capable of generating at least 9 blocks in a 36 hour window. It should be isolated from the rest of the network. The chain can then be recovered by resetting the wall clocks on the group of block producing nodes, restarting them from the last good block on the Cardano network, playing forward the chain production at high speed (10x usual speed is recommended), while inserting new empty blocks at the slots which are allocated to the block producers. The recovery nodes can then be restarted with normal settings, including connections to the network. Ouroboros Genesis then allows other nodes in the network to rapidly resynchronize with the newly restored chain. This would leave one or more gaps in the chain, interspersed with empty blocks.\nIn order to avoid allegations of unfair behaviour, block producing nodes that are used to recover the network should donate any rewards that they receive during recovery to the treasury.\nUnlike Scenario 1, no transactions will be submitted that need to be resubmitted on the chain. Users will, however, experience an extended period during which the chain is unavailable. Cardano applications and contracts should be designed with this possibility in mind. Full node wallets and other node users should recover quickly once the network is restarted but there may be a period of instability while network connections are re-established and the Ouroboros Genesis snapshot is distributed across all nodes.\nThe chain will tolerate a gap of up to 3k/f slots (36 hours with current Cardano mainnet settings). A period of low chain density could have security implications that affect dynamic availability and leave open the possibility for future long range attacks. This may be particularly relevant should chain recovery be performed as described above (using less stake than is required for an honest majority). To mitigate the presence of an extended period of low chain density we may need to make use of the lightweight checkpointing mechanism in Ouroborus Genesis. Alternatively, Mithril could also be used to provide certified snapshots to stake pools as a means to verify the correct state of the ledger.\nThe adoption of Mithril for fast bootstrapping by light clients and edge nodes should help to mitigate risks for the types of users on the network that do not participate in consensus.\nAs described below, Ouroboros Genesis snapshots may also be useful as part of the recovery process.\nIn the event that a bad block was to be minted on-chain, then some or all validators might be unable to process the block. They would therefore stop, and be unable to restart. Wallet and other nodes might be unable to synchronise beyond the point of the bad block.\nDepending on the cause of the issue and its severity, alternative remediations might be possible.\nScenario 3.1: if some existing node versions were able to process the block, but others were not, then the chain would continue to grow at a lower chain density. SPOs would need to be persuaded to upgrade (or downgrade) to a suitable node version that would allow the chain to continue. The chain density would then gradually recover to its normal level. Other users would need to upgrade (or downgrade) to a version of the node that could follow the full chain.\nScenario 3.2: if no node version was able to process the block and a gap of less than 3k/f slots existed, then the chain could be rolled back immediately before the bad block was created, and nodes restarted from this point. The chain would then grow as normal, with a small gap around the bad block. In this case, care would need to be taken that the rogue transaction was not accidentally reinserted into the chain. This might involve clearing node mempools, applying filters on the transaction, or developing and deploying a new node version that rejected the bad block.\nScenario 3.3: an alternative to rolling back would be to develop and deploy a \"hot-fix\" node that could accept the bad block, either as an exception, or as new acceptable behaviour. Nodes would then be able to incorporate the bad block as part of the chain, minting new blocks as usual, or following the chain. In this case, the bad block would persist on-chain indefinitely and future nodes would also need to accept the bad block. Such an approach is best used when the rejected block has behaviour that was unanticipated, but which is benign in nature. This will leave no abnormal gaps in the chain.\nScenario 3.4: if more than 3k/f slots have passed since the bad block was minted, then it will be necessary to roll back the chain immediately prior to the bad block as in Scenario 3.2, and then proceed as described for Scenario 2. As with Scenario 2, this will leave a series of gaps in the chain that are interspersed with empty blocks.\nIf more than 3k/f slots have passed since the bad block was minted on-chain (36 hours with current Cardano mainnet settings), then a mix of recovery techniques will be needed, as described in Scenario 3.4. When deciding on the correct recovery technique for Scenarios 3.1-3.3, consideration should be given as to whether the recovery can be successfully completed before 3k/f slots have elapsed. In case of doubt, the procedure for Scenario 3.4 should be followed.\nAny of the above conditions may result in a period of lower chain density. The updated consensus mechanism introduced in Ouroboros Genesis relies on making chain density comparisons to assist a node when catching up with the network, in order to reduce the reliance on having trusted peers when syncing. As such, low-density periods pose a potential security risk for the future; they are periods where a motivated adversary could perform a long-range attack by building a higher density chain.\nIn order to mitigate this, Genesis introduces the concepts of lightweight checkpoints. A lightweight checkpoint is effectively a block point - a combination of block number and hash - which can be distributed along with the node. Unlike Mithril Snapshots (see below), Genesis lightweight snapshots are not assured by any committee - rather, they form part of the trusted codebase distributed with the node, or by other parties.\nWhen syncing, a Genesis node will refuse to validate past the block number of any lightweight checkpoint if the chain does not contain the correct block at that point.\nGenesis snapshots play two potential roles in disaster recovery:\nNote that, in this second scenario, concerns about the legitimacy of the checkpoint are much less salient. The checkpoint can be issued post disaster recovery, at such a time where the points it contains are in the past, and are both agreed upon and easy to verify for all honest parties.\nMithril is a stake-based threshold multi-signatures scheme. One of the applications of this protocol in Cardano is to create certified snapshots of the Cardano blockchain. Mithril snapshots allow nodes or applications to obtain a verified copy of the current state of the blockchain without having to download and verify the full history.\nSPOs that participate in the Mithril network provide signed snapshots to a Mithril aggregator that is responsible for collecting individual signatures from Mithril signers and aggregating them into a multi-signature. Using this capability, the Mithril aggregator can then provide certified snapshots of the Cardano blockchain that can potentially be used as a trusted source for recovery purposes.\nProvided that it gains sufficient adoption on the Cardano network and that snapshots continue to be signed by an honest majority of stake pools following a chain recovery event, Mithril may therefore provide an alternative solution to Ouroboros Genesis checkpoints as a way to verify the correct state of the ledger\nOne of the key requirements for successful disaster recovery will be proper engagement with the community.\nThis CIP outlines key disaster recovery scenarios that the Cardano community should understand to mitigate potential network outages. As a living document, it will be regularly reviewed and updated to inform stakeholders and encourage more detailed contingency planning. The CIP aims to facilitate discussions, establish recovery procedures, and encourage regular recovery practice exercises to ensure preparedness and validation of recovery actions in the event of an outage.\nThe proposal has been reviewed by the community and sufficiently advertised on various channels.\nAll major concerns or feedback have been addressed.\nN/A\nCardano Disaster Recovery Plan (May 2021)\nCardano Incident Reports\nJanuary 2023 Block Production Temporary Outage\nDB Truncator Tool\nDB Synthesizer Tool\nOuroboros Genesis\nMithril\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

Some of these artifacts support the linking of off-chain metadata, as a way to provide context to on-chain actions.\nThe CIP-100 | Governance Metadata standard provides a base framework for how all off-chain governance metadata can be formed and handled. This standard was intentionally limited in scope, so that it can be expanded upon by more specific subsequent CIPs.\nThis proposal aims to provide a specification for the off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to Constitutional Committee (CC) votes.\nThe high-level motivation for this proposal is to provide a standard which improves legitimacy of Cardano's governance system.\nGovernance action authors are likely to have dedicated a significant amount of time to making their action meaningful and effective (as well as locking a significant deposit). If this action is not able to be ratified by the CC, it is fair for the author to expect a reasonable explanation from the CC.\nWithout reasonable context being provided by the CC votes, authors may struggle to iterate upon their actions, until they are deemed constitutional.

This context should show CC member's decision making is fair and reasonable.\nThis context allows the other voting bodies to adequately check the power of the CC.\nThe CC and their votes are fundamentally very different from the other voting bodies. This makes reusing standards from these voting bodies problematic.\nCardano's Interim Constitution Article VI Section 4 states:\nConstitutional Committee processes shall be transparent. The Constitutional Committee shall publish each decision.

    "completion": "We propose to create a decentralized message diffusion protocol leveraging the Cardano network layer. This protocol allows to follow a topic based diffusion of messages from publishers to subscribers in a decentralized way.\nThe messages can be sent and received by nodes running in a non intrusive way side by side to the Cardano node in order to enable inter-nodes communications.\nIn this way, we can significantly reduce the cost and effort required to build a decentralised network for message diffusion by using Cardano's established infrastructure, with limited impact on the performance and no impact on the security of the Cardano network.\nMany protocols in the Cardano ecosystem need the capability to diffuse messages in a decentralized manner. However, it is not possible to diffuse any type of message from Cardano block producers to a limited subset of subscribed peers. Nonetheless, the Cardano network has a proven efficient, reliable and secure infrastructure which is used to diffuse a transaction from one peer to all the other peers in the network. This infrastructure can be leveraged to achieve the goal of diffusing other types of messages with the guarantees offered by the Cardano network and a reduced development overhead.\nMithril is a protocol based on a Stake-based Threshold Multi-signature scheme which leverages the Cardano SPOs to certify data from the Cardano chain in a trustless way. Mithril is currently used in the Cardano ecosystem in order to enable fast bootstrapping of full nodes and enabling secure light wallets. The Mithril protocol coordinates the collection of individual signatures originating from the signers (run by SPOs) by the aggregators which combine them into Mithril multi-signatures and certificates. In order to be fully decentralized, the protocol needs to rely on a decentralized peer to peer network which, if built from the ground up, would require significant efforts and investment. Furthermore, the majority of SPO's, as the representatives of Cardano's active stake, will have to adopt and operate Mithril nodes alongside their Cardano node. Thus a natural solution is to use the Cardano network layer to significantly facilitate the development of the Mithril protocol without a significant impact on the Cardano network or high maintenance efforts for the SPOs. Mithril will be a fundamental first user of the proposed Decentralized Message Queue and it will be used as an illustrative example throughout this document.\nOther protocols in the Cardano ecosystem, such as Leios and Peras (and probably other protocols in the future), also need the capability to diffuse messages originating from block producers in a decentralized fashion. However, in the Leios and Peras cases, the Cardano node itself is a producer and consumer of these messages. We have taken into consideration this need for a generic solution in the design proposed.\nThe proposed solution is described in detail below.\nThis specification proposes to create 3 new mini-protocols in the Cardano network layer:\n3\nnode-2-node\nnode-2-client\n[!NOTE] The terms Message producer, Message consumer and Network node may represent different entities depending on the concrete implementation made for a specific protocol:\nHere is a summary of the meanings of these terms depending on the protocol:\nThe node to node message submission protocol is used to transfer messages between full nodes. It follows a pull-based strategy where the inbound side asks for new messages and the outbound side returns them back. This protocol is designed to guard both sides against resource consumption attacks from the other side in a trustless setting.\n[!NOTE] There exists a local message submission protocol which is used when the server trusts a local client as described in the following section.\nstateDiagram-v2 classDef White fill:white,stroke:white classDef Black fill:white,stroke:black classDef Blue fill:white,stroke:blue classDef Green fill:white,stroke:green start:::White --> StInit:::Green StInit:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgInit StIdle:::Blue --> StMessageIdsBlocking:::Green : MsgRequestMessageIdsBlocking StMessageIdsBlocking:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgReplyMessageIds StIdle:::Blue --> StMessageIdsNonBlocking:::Green : MsgRequestMessageIdsNonBlocking StMessageIdsNonBlocking:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgReplyMessageIds StMessageIdsBlocking:::Green --> StDone:::Black : MsgDone StIdle:::Blue --> StMessages:::Green : MsgRequestMessages StMessages:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgReplyMessages\nstateDiagram-v2 classDef White fill:white,stroke:white classDef Black fill:white,stroke:black classDef Blue fill:white,stroke:blue classDef Green fill:white,stroke:green start:::White --> StInit:::Green StInit:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgInit StIdle:::Blue --> StMessageIdsBlocking:::Green : MsgRequestMessageIdsBlocking StMessageIdsBlocking:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgReplyMessageIds StIdle:::Blue --> StMessageIdsNonBlocking:::Green : MsgRequestMessageIdsNonBlocking StMessageIdsNonBlocking:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgReplyMessageIds StMessageIdsBlocking:::Green --> StDone:::Black : MsgDone StIdle:::Blue --> StMessages:::Green : MsgRequestMessages StMessages:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgReplyMessages\n[!NOTE] The StInit state is needed as it allows to start all outbound sides on the same side of the connection, which is needed as the information flows in the opposite direction with this special message submission mini-protocol.

A time to live can be set as a protocol parameter for each topic, and once the timespan has elapsed the message is discarded in the internal state of the network node. The time to live can be based on the timestamp of reception of the message on the network node or on the block number embedded in the message.\n[!NOTE] Computations are based on the assumption of a 30 minutes TTL for messages and are assuming that the messages are stored once in the memory of the network node (i.e. the aforementioned FIFO queues store reference to the messages).\nFor a total of 3,100 Cardano SPOs on the mainnet, on an average 50 of them will be eligible to send signatures (i.e. will win at least one lottery in the Mithril protocol). This means that if the full Cardano stake distribution is involved in the Mithril protocol, only 1,550 signers will send signatures at each round:\nmainnet\nThe message body is signed with the KES key of the SPO. This signature and the operational certificate of the SPO are appended to the message which is diffused.\nBefore being diffused to other peers, an incoming message must be verified by the receiving node. This is done with the following steps:\nIf any of these step fails, the message is considered as invalid, which is a protocol violation.\n[!WARNING] We also probably need to make sure that the KES key used to sign is from the latest rotation:\nIf the opcert number received is strictly lower than the previous one which has been seen, it should be considered as a protocol violation.\n[!NOTE] Computations are based on the assumption of a 2 ms KES signature verification time on a virtual CPU, which may vary depending on the infrastructure.\nFor a total of 3,100 Cardano SPOs on the mainnet, on an average 50 of them will be eligible to send signatures (i.e. will win at least one lottery in the Mithril protocol). This means that if the full Cardano stake distribution is involved in the Mithril protocol, only 1,550 signers will send signatures at each round:\nmainnet\n[!NOTE] The below computations of the network throughput and volume apply a multiplicative factor of 2 to the number of messages transmitted to reflect the redundancy of the diffusion mechanism.\n[!WARNING] Some compression can be applied to the Mithril signatures which allows them to always be on the lower bound size, but it is not implemented yet.\nThe following tables gather figures about expected network load in the case of Mithril using the mini-protocol to diffuse the individual signatures:\nFor a total of 3,100 Cardano SPOs on the mainnet, on an average 50 of them will be eligible to send signatures (i.e. will win at least one lottery in the Mithril protocol). This means that if the full Cardano stake distribution is involved in the Mithril protocol, only 1,550 signers will send signatures at each round:\nmainnet\n[!NOTE]\nFor a total of 3,000 SPOs sending messages, the extra networking cost incurred for a Cardano full node is:\n3,000\nIn this attack, a malicious sender would attempt to create multiple identities impersonating SPOs. This attack is completely mitigated by the Message authentication mechanism as only active SPO on the Cardano chain can be authenticated and send messages. This would be considered as a protocol violation and the malicous peer would be disconnected.\nIn this attack, a malicious SPO would send different messages to different peers. This attack needs to be handled by the receiver of the message as the network layer does not verify the content of the message body by design.\nIn the specific case of Mithril, the individual signature is unique so there will be two cases:\nIn this attack, a malicous SPO would try to flood the network by sending many messages at once. In that case, the network layer could detect that the throughput of messages originating from a SPO is above a threshold and consider it as a protocol violation, thus disconnecting the malicous peer. If a peer asks for N messages and receives more than N messages, then it would also be considered as a protocol violation. Also, the way mini-protocols are implemented allows to set a maximum message size.\nA standalone network node will use its own handshake. It can introduce its own protocol parameters, but quite likely it will start with NodeToNodeVersionData:\nhandshake\nNodeToNodeVersionData\ndata NodeToNodeVersionData = NodeToNodeVersionData { networkMagic :: !NetworkMagic , diffusionMode :: !DiffusionMode , peerSharing :: !PeerSharing , query :: !Bool } deriving (Show, Typeable, Eq)\ndata NodeToNodeVersionData = NodeToNodeVersionData { networkMagic :: !NetworkMagic , diffusionMode :: !DiffusionMode , peerSharing :: !PeerSharing , query :: !Bool } deriving (Show, Typeable, Eq)\nnetworkMagic\nnetworkMagic\ndiffusionMode\npeerSharing\nquery\ncardano-cli ping\nThe local message submission mini-protocol is used by local clients to submit message to a local network node. This mini-protocol is not used to diffuse messages from a network node to another.\nThe protocol follows a simple request-response pattern:\nstateDiagram-v2 classDef White fill:white,stroke:white classDef Black fill:white,stroke:black classDef Blue fill:white,stroke:blue classDef Green fill:white,stroke:green start:::White --> StIdle:::Blue; StIdle:::Blue --> StBusy:::Green : MsgSubmitMessage StBusy:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgAcceptMessage StBusy:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgRejectMessage StIdle:::Blue --> StDone:::Black : MsgDone\nstateDiagram-v2 classDef White fill:white,stroke:white classDef Black fill:white,stroke:black classDef Blue fill:white,stroke:blue classDef Green fill:white,stroke:green start:::White --> StIdle:::Blue; StIdle:::Blue --> StBusy:::Green : MsgSubmitMessage StBusy:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgAcceptMessage StBusy:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgRejectMessage StIdle:::Blue --> StDone:::Black : MsgDone\nThe local message notification mini-protocol is used by local clients to be notified about new message received by the network node.\nThe protocol follows a simple request-response pattern:\nstateDiagram-v2 classDef White fill:white,stroke:white classDef Black fill:white,stroke:black classDef Blue fill:white,stroke:blue classDef Green fill:white,stroke:green start:::White --> StIdle:::Blue; StIdle:::Blue --> StBusy:::Green : MsgNextMessage StBusy:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgHasMessage StBusy:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgTimeoutMessage StIdle:::Blue --> StDone:::Black : MsgDone\nstateDiagram-v2 classDef White fill:white,stroke:white classDef Black fill:white,stroke:black classDef Blue fill:white,stroke:blue classDef Green fill:white,stroke:green start:::White --> StIdle:::Blue; StIdle:::Blue --> StBusy:::Green : MsgNextMessage StBusy:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgHasMessage StBusy:::Green --> StIdle:::Blue : MsgTimeoutMessage StIdle:::Blue --> StDone:::Black : MsgDone\nMithril requires strong network foundations to support interactions between its various nodes:\nWhy would it be great for Cardano to support a decentralized message queue with its network?\nIn this section, we propose an architecture for Cardano and Mithril. Note, in this section, Mithril is used as a placeholder for a possible Mithril application: we've seen many ideas about how Mithril can be used in Cardano and all of them can follow this design.\nCardano\nMithril\nMithril\nMithril\nMithril\nCardano\nAny software included in cardano-node needs to undergo a rigorous development and review process to avoid catastrophic events. We think that merging Cardano, a mature software, with new technologies, should be a process, and thus we propose first to develop Decentralized Message Queue (DMQ) nodes as standalone processes which communicate with cardano-node via its local interface (node-to-client protocol). As we will see, this approach has advantages for the Mithril network and SPOs.\ncardano-node\nCardano\nDecentralized Message Queue (DMQ)\ncardano-node\nnode-to-client\nMithril\nOuroboros-Network (ON) is, to a large extent, an agnostic network stack, which can be adapted to be used by both Cardano and DMQ nodes. To construct an overlay network, the stack needs to access stake pool information registered on chain. This can be done via the node-to-client protocol over a Unix socket. Since DMQ nodes will have their own end-points, we'll either need to propose a modification to the SPO registration process, which includes Mithril instantiated DMQ nodes, or we could pass incoming Mithril connections from cardano-node to the DMQ node via CMSG_DATA.\nOuroboros-Network\nCardano\nDMQ\nnode-to-client\nDMQ\nMithril\nDMQ\nMithril\ncardano-node\nDMQ\nOuroboros-Network outbound governor component, which is responsible for creating the overlay network has a built-in mechanism which churns connections based on a defined metric. By developing a standalone Mithril network node, we can design metrics specific for the purpose. This way, the Mithril network will optimise for its benefits rather than being stuck in a suboptimal solution from its perspective - if Mithril and Cardano were tied more strongly (e.g. as part cardano-node), then we wouldn't have that opportunity because Cardano must meet its deadlines, or the security of the system as a whole must be at stake.\nOuroboros-Network\nMithril network\nMithril\nMithril\nCardano\ncardano-node\nCardano\nEventually, there will be many Mithril applications, and all of them might have different network requirements and thus might require slightly different configurations. We SHOULD aim to build something that can be used as a scaffolding for such applications. This may also open future avenues for delivering new functionalities that fit together well with existing infrastructure while still mitigating the risk of catastrophic events at the core of the system.\nMithril\nPlease also note that any protocols and their instances that will be built as part of the standalone DMQ node could be reused in future for Peras and Leios. It will give us even more confidence that the future core system will be built from components that are used in production.\nDMQ\nPeras\nLeios\nCardano and DMQ nodes, as separate executables, can still be packaged together, lowering the barrier of participation. When run separately, the SPO is also in better control of the resources dedicated to each process - this is important for the health of both systems.\nCardano\nDMQ\nAnother benefit of such a design is that DMQ node can be developed on its own pace, not affected by significant changes in other parts of the system like ledger - the Cardano Core team restrains itself to not publishing new cardano-node versions with significant changes across many of its subsystems - just for the sake of clarity of where to look if a bug is found.\nDMQ\ncardano-node\nIn this design, a DMQ node runs alongside a cardano-node, which is connected to it via a UNIX socket (node-to-client) protocol. This means an SPO will run a DMQ node instantiated for Mithril per cardano-node. Future protocols will run their custom instantiated new DMQ node instance. The DMQ node connected to BP can also have access to necessary keys for signing purposes. DMQ node might also use the KES agent, as cardano-node will in the near future, to securely access the KES key.\nDMQ\ncardano-node\nnode-to-client\nDMQ\nMithril\ncardano-node\nDMQ\nDMQ\nDMQ\ncardano-node\n[!WARNING] A hard-fork of the Cardano chain may be required if some information, like peer ports for an overlay network, are to be registered by the SPOs on-chain.\nThis CIP is licensed under Apache-2.0\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "We propose an array builtin type for Plutus Core. This type will have constant-time lookup, which is a useful feature that is otherwise not possible to achieve.\nThe first part of CPS-0013 outlines in great detail the motivation for introducing this new builtin type.\nTo summarize, it is currently not possible to write a data structure with constant-time lookup in Plutus Core. We propose to solve this problem by introducing an array type into Plutus Core's builtin language, as it is the standard example of a data structure with this property, and it is a key component of many classical algorithms and data structures.\nAccess to an array type would provide significant performance improvement opportunities to users of Plutus Core, since currently they must rely on suboptimal data structures such as lists for looking up elements inside a collection.\nWe add the following builtin type: Array of kind Type - Type representing a one-dimensional array type with indices of type Integer. Elements are indexed consecutively starting from 0.\nArray\nType -> Type\nInteger\n0\nNote: Here Type is the universe of all builtin types, since we do not consider types formed out of applying builtin types to arbitrary types to be inhabited.\nType\nThe Array builtin type should be implemented with a fixed-size immutable array structure that has constant-time lookup.\nArray\nWe add the following builtin functions:\nindexArray\nforall a .

However, there remains the question of how users should deal with the function's partiality. We considered the following options:\nindexArray\nIntroduce another new builtin type, one which implements Maybe semantics. The type signature for indexArray would become forall a . Integer - Array a - Maybe a and it would return Nothing for out-of-bounds lookups.\nMaybe\nindexArray\nforall a . Integer -> Array a -> Maybe a\nNothing\nMaybe\nMaybe\nFailed lookups return a default value provided by the caller: indexArray :: forall a . Integer - a - Array a - a.\nindexArray :: forall a . Integer -> a -> Array a -> a\nerror\nindexArray\nforall a . Integer -> (() -> a) -> Array a -> a\nInclude lengthOfArray and require the user to perform appropriate length guards before calling indexArray.\nlengthOfArray\nindexArray\nAfter considering these three options, we concluded that the addition of the lengthOfArray builtin function is both necessary and sufficient for introducing a well-defined array type into the builtin language.\nlengthOfArray\nThe last required functionality for having a practical interface is the ability to construct arrays.\nDue to our decision of providing immutable arrays, it is difficult (or very expensive) to build up arrays incrementally. A naive approach would require repeated copying and potentially the usage of quadratic space and time.\nA more appropriate approach would be to construct the array in bulk, however that would require an intermediate representation of a collection of elements. Fortunately this already exists in the builtin language in the form of builtin lists. We can then naturally introduce a function which transforms lists into arrays: listToArray.\nlistToArray\nMany array-like data structures support cheap slices, e.g. a function with the following type signature: slice :: Integer - Integer - Array a - Array a, which produces a view of the original array between the two indices (similarly, the same can be achieved using an indexArray and a lengthOfArray).\nslice :: Integer -> Integer -> Array a -> Array a\nindexArray\nlengthOfArray\nWe do not propose to add slice to our builtin set, since it is very easy to build a data structure that supports slices on top of array, simply by tracking some additional integers to track the subset of the array that is in view.\nslice\narray\nData\nIn CPS-0013 the idea of representing the arguments to the Data constructor Constr as an Array in Plutus Core was presented as being more appropriate than the current list representation.\nData\nConstr\nArray\nA significant requirement in implementing this modification is maintaining backwards compatibility. Therefore, we cannot simply modify the internal representation of Data.\nData\nOne idea would be to add a new builtin such as the following: unConstrDataArray :: Data - (Integer, Array Data). However, this builtin will inevitably have linear time complexity since it is based on a list traversal. So it does not actually solve the original problem, unless it can be shown experimentally that, in practice, these lists are usually small enough for the transformation to be negligible.\nunConstrDataArray :: Data -> (Integer, Array Data)\nThe implementation of this CIP should not proceed without an empirical assessment of the effectiveness of the new primitives, as per the following plan:\nIf the preliminary performance investigation was not successful, this CIP should be revised according to the findings of the experiment. Otherwise, the implementation can proceed:\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "This CIP proposes an extension of the current plutus functions to provide support for basic operations over BLS12-381 curve to the plutus language. We expose a candidate implementation, and describe clearly the benefits that this would bring. In a nutshell, pairing friendly curves will enable a large number of cryptographic primitives that will be essential for the scalability of Cardano.\nPairing Friendly Curves are a type of curves that provide the functionality of computing pairings. A pairing is a binary function that maps two points from two groups to a third element in a third target group. For a more in-depth introduction to pairings, we recommend reading Pairings for Beginners or Pairings for Cryptographers. For level of detail required in this document, it is sufficient to understand that a pairing is a map: e:G1 X G2 - GT, which satisfies the following properties:\nwhere G1, G2 and GT are three distinct groups of order a prime q. Pairing computation is an expensive operation. However, they enable a range of interesting cryptographic primitives which can be used for scaling Cardano and many other use cases. We now provide a list of use cases of pairings as well as an estimated operation count to understand the number of 'expensive' operations that need to be computed for each of them (a preliminary benchmark can be found in Section 'Costing of function').\nscalar X scalar\nWe now provide the technical specification.\nThe added types will be the following, all of which can be represented as a byte array. Even if these types are equivalent to byte arrays of a given size, it makes sense to include these types, to enforce deserialization, and therefore some checks on the data used by the smart contract. In particular, bls12_381_G1_element and bls12_381_G2_element can only be generated with byte arrays that represent a point which is part of the prime order subgroup. On the other hand, bls12_381_MlResult can only be generated as a result of the bls12_381_millerLoop computatio.\nbls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G2_element\nbls12_381_MlResult\nbls12_381_millerLoop\nbls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G2_element\nbls12_381_MlResult\nWe need to support the binary operation of G1 and G2 (which are additive groups), as well as the binary operation over MlResult (which is represented as a multiplicative group). We also want to enable hashing to G1 and G2. In particular, we expose the hash to curve (which we denote with hashToGroup) algorithm as described in hash to curve draft, using BLS12381G1_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_ and BLS12381G2_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_ for G1 and G2 respectively. We do not include the type of the Scalar, nor operations related to it. These type of operations can already be performed with the Integer type. In particular, we need the following functions:\nhashToGroup\nBLS12381G1_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_\nBLS12381G2_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_\nInteger\nbls12_381_G1_add :: bls12_381_G1_element -> bls12_381_G1_element -> bls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G1_scalarMul :: Integer -> bls12_381_G1_element -> bls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G1_neg :: bls12_381_G1_element -> bls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G2_add :: bls12_381_G2_element -> bls12_381_G2_element -> bls12_381_G2_element\nbls12_381_G2_scalarMul :: Integer -> bls12_381_G2_element -> bls12_381_G2_element\nbls12_381_G2_neg :: bls12_381_G2_element -> bls12_381_G2_element\nbls12_381_mulMlResult :: bls12_381_MlResult -> bls12_381_MlResult -> bls12_381_MlResult\nbls12_381_millerLoop :: bls12_381_G1_element -> bls12_381_G2_element -> bls12_381_MlResult\nbls12_381_finalVerify :: bls12_381_MlResult -> bls12_381_MlResult -> Bool\nAn important note on MlResult elements\nbls12_381_G1_hashToGroup :: ByteString -> ByteString -> bls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G2_hashToGroup :: ByteString -> ByteString -> bls12_381_G2_element\nOn top of the elliptic curve operations, we also need to include deserialization functions, and equality definitions among the G1 and G2 types.\nbls12_381_G1_compress :: bls12_381_G1_element -> ByteString\nbls12_381_G1_uncompress :: ByteString -> bls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G2_compress :: bls12_381_G2_element -> ByteString\nbls12_381_G2_uncompress :: ByteString -> bls12_381_G2_element\nbls12_381_G1_equal :: bls12_381_G1_element -> bls12_381_G1_element -> Bool\nbls12_381_G2_equal :: bls12_381_G2_element -> bls12_381_G2_element -> Bool\nThis makes a total of 17 new functions and three new types.\nWe follow the ZCash Bls12-381 specification for the serialization of elements:\nThe most-significant three bits of a G1 or G2 encoding should be masked away before the coordinate(s) are interpreted.

The function signature takes as input two ByteStrings and returns a point. The first ByteString is the message to be hashed, while the second ByteString is the Domain Separation Tag (DST). For more information on the DST, see section 3.1 of the internet draft. We limit the DST to be at most 255 bytes, following the standard specification. If applications require a domain separation tag that is longer than 255 bytes, they should convert it to a smaller DST following the instructions of the standard draft (see section 5.3.3).\nByteString\nByteString\nByteString\nSome libraries expose the possibility to use yet another ByteString when calling the hash-to-curve function. See for example the blst library. We choose not to include this extra ByteString in the function signature, because it is not part of the standard draft. In the case where we want to match a hash that did use this aug ByteString, one simply needs to prepend that value to the message. One can verify that by running the test-vector generation script introduced in cardano-base.\nByteString\nblst\nByteString\naug\nByteString\nTo recap, we have types bls12_381_G1_element and bls12_381_G2_element each of which is essentially a pair of values (x,y) that satisfy an equation of the form y 2 = x 3+ax+b. The blst library provides two serialisation formats for these:\nbls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G2_element\n(x,y)\ny^2 = x^3+ax+b\nx\ny\nbls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G2_element\nx\ny\nbls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G2_element\nThe PLC implementation currently uses the compressed format for serialising bls12_381_G1_element and bls12_381_G1_elements. There are at least three places where this is (or could be) used:\nbls12_381_G1_element\nbls12_381_G1_element\nThe serialised format could also be used for all of these. The advantage of doing that is that deserialisation is much cheaper than uncompression (which involves calculating a square root in a finite field, which is expensive in general), but the disadvantage is that the serialised format requires twice as much space as the compressed form. We ran some benchmarks to determine CPU costs (in ExUnits) for both deserialisation, and uncompression and came up with the following:\nbls12_381_G1_deserialize : 701442 bls12_381_G1_uncompress : 16511372 bls12_381_G2_deserialize : 1095773 bls12_381_G2_uncompress : 33114723\nbls12_381_G1_deserialize : 701442 bls12_381_G1_uncompress : 16511372 bls12_381_G2_deserialize : 1095773 bls12_381_G2_uncompress : 33114723\nFor G1 uncompression is about 23 times more expensive than deserialisation, and for G2 uncompression is about 30 times more expensive than deserialisation. The maximum CPU budget per script is currently 1,000,000,000, so a single G2 uncompression is about 0.3 of the total allowance, whereas a G2 deserialisation is about 0.01 . This might seem like a compelling reason to prefer serialisation over compression, but our claim is that the time saving is not worthwhile because you can't fit enough serialised points into a script to make the speed gain significant. The bls12-381-costs program runs a number of benchmarks for execution costs of scripts that exercise the BLS builtins. One of these creates UPLC scripts which include varying numbers of compressed points and at run-time uncompresses them and adds them all together; bls-381-costs runs these scripts and prints out their costs as fractions of the maximum CPU budget and maximum script size (currently 16384). Here are the results:\nUncompress n G1 points and add the results\nn script size CPU usage Memory usage ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - 68 (0.4%) 100 (0.0%) 100 (0.0%) 10 618 (3.8%) 185801250 (1.9%) 45642 (0.3%) 20 1168 (7.1%) 371912820 (3.7%) 88002 (0.6%) 30 1718 (10.5%) 558024390 (5.6%) 130362 (0.9%) 40 2268 (13.8%) 744135960 (7.4%) 172722 (1.2%) 50 2818 (17.2%) 930247530 (9.3%) 215082 (1.5%) 60 3368 (20.6%) 1116359100 (11.2%) 257442 (1.8%) 70 3918 (23.9%) 1302470670 (13.0%) 299802 (2.1%) 80 4468 (27.3%) 1488582240 (14.9%) 342162 (2.4%) 90 5018 (30.6%) 1674693810 (16.7%) 384522 (2.7%) 100 5568 (34.0%) 1860805380 (18.6%) 426882 (3.0%) 110 6118 (37.3%) 2046916950 (20.5%) 469242 (3.4%) 120 6668 (40.7%) 2233028520 (22.3%) 511602 (3.7%) 130 7218 (44.1%) 2419140090 (24.2%) 553962 (4.0%) 140 7768 (47.4%) 2605251660 (26.1%) 596322 (4.3%) 150 8318 (50.8%) 2791363230 (27.9%) 638682 (4.6%)\nn script size CPU usage Memory usage ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - 68 (0.4%) 100 (0.0%) 100 (0.0%) 10 618 (3.8%) 185801250 (1.9%) 45642 (0.3%) 20 1168 (7.1%) 371912820 (3.7%) 88002 (0.6%) 30 1718 (10.5%) 558024390 (5.6%) 130362 (0.9%) 40 2268 (13.8%) 744135960 (7.4%) 172722 (1.2%) 50 2818 (17.2%) 930247530 (9.3%) 215082 (1.5%) 60 3368 (20.6%) 1116359100 (11.2%) 257442 (1.8%) 70 3918 (23.9%) 1302470670 (13.0%) 299802 (2.1%) 80 4468 (27.3%) 1488582240 (14.9%) 342162 (2.4%) 90 5018 (30.6%) 1674693810 (16.7%) 384522 (2.7%) 100 5568 (34.0%) 1860805380 (18.6%) 426882 (3.0%) 110 6118 (37.3%) 2046916950 (20.5%) 469242 (3.4%) 120 6668 (40.7%) 2233028520 (22.3%) 511602 (3.7%) 130 7218 (44.1%) 2419140090 (24.2%) 553962 (4.0%) 140 7768 (47.4%) 2605251660 (26.1%) 596322 (4.3%) 150 8318 (50.8%) 2791363230 (27.9%) 638682 (4.6%)\nUncompress n G2 points and add the results\nn script size CPU usage Memory usage ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - 68 (0.4%) 100 (0.0%) 100 (0.0%) 10 1098 (6.7%) 363545910 (3.6%) 45984 (0.3%) 20 2128 (13.0%) 728715130 (7.3%) 88704 (0.6%) 30 3158 (19.3%) 1093884350 (10.9%) 131424 (0.9%) 40 4188 (25.6%) 1459053570 (14.6%) 174144 (1.2%) 50 5218 (31.8%) 1824222790 (18.2%) 216864 (1.5%) 60 6248 (38.1%) 2189392010 (21.9%) 259584 (1.9%) 70 7278 (44.4%) 2554561230 (25.5%) 302304 (2.2%) 80 8308 (50.7%) 2919730450 (29.2%) 345024 (2.5%) 90 9338 (57.0%) 3284899670 (32.8%) 387744 (2.8%) 100 10368 (63.3%) 3650068890 (36.5%) 430464 (3.1%) 110 11398 (69.6%) 4015238110 (40.2%) 473184 (3.4%) 120 12428 (75.9%) 4380407330 (43.8%) 515904 (3.7%) 130 13458 (82.1%) 4745576550 (47.5%) 558624 (4.0%) 140 14488 (88.4%) 5110745770 (51.1%) 601344 (4.3%) 150 15518 (94.7%) 5475914990 (54.8%) 644064 (4.6%)\nn script size CPU usage Memory usage ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - 68 (0.4%) 100 (0.0%) 100 (0.0%) 10 1098 (6.7%) 363545910 (3.6%) 45984 (0.3%) 20 2128 (13.0%) 728715130 (7.3%) 88704 (0.6%) 30 3158 (19.3%) 1093884350 (10.9%) 131424 (0.9%) 40 4188 (25.6%) 1459053570 (14.6%) 174144 (1.2%) 50 5218 (31.8%) 1824222790 (18.2%) 216864 (1.5%) 60 6248 (38.1%) 2189392010 (21.9%) 259584 (1.9%) 70 7278 (44.4%) 2554561230 (25.5%) 302304 (2.2%) 80 8308 (50.7%) 2919730450 (29.2%) 345024 (2.5%) 90 9338 (57.0%) 3284899670 (32.8%) 387744 (2.8%) 100 10368 (63.3%) 3650068890 (36.5%) 430464 (3.1%) 110 11398 (69.6%) 4015238110 (40.2%) 473184 (3.4%) 120 12428 (75.9%) 4380407330 (43.8%) 515904 (3.7%) 130 13458 (82.1%) 4745576550 (47.5%) 558624 (4.0%) 140 14488 (88.4%) 5110745770 (51.1%) 601344 (4.3%) 150 15518 (94.7%) 5475914990 (54.8%) 644064 (4.6%)\nIt's clear from these figures that the limiting factor is the script size: about 300 G1 points or 150 G2 points can be processed in a single script before exceeding the script size limit, but the maximum CPU usage is only 55 of the the maximum CPU budget. If the serialisation (involving both x- and y-coordinates) was used instead then there would be some saving in execution time, but a single script would only be able to process about half as many points and it's unlikely that the time savings would compensate for that. For example, uncompressing 50 G2 points would cost about 1,655,000,000 CPU ExUnits and deserialising them would cost about 54,788,000, which is 1,600,000,000 ExUnits cheaper. At the time of writing, this equates to 0.27 Ada. However, 50 serialised G2 points take up 4800 more bytes than 50 compressed ones, and the extra bytes would cost 0.36 Ada. Thuis using serialisation would cost 0.09 Ada more than using compression for the same number of points.\nIn summary: even though uncompression is a lot more expensive per point than deserialisation, the size savings due to compression actually outweigh the speed gains due to serialisation because bytes per script are a lot more expensive than ExUnits per script in real terms. For this reason, we propose to support the compressed format and only the compressed format.\nWe intentionally limit what can be done with the MlResult element. In fact, the only way that one can generate a MlResult element is using the bls12_381_millerLoop function. Then these elements can only be used for operations among them (multiplication) and a final equality check (denoted finalVerify). In other words, MlResult elements are only there to eventually perform some equality checks. We thought of including the inverse function to allow division, but given that we simply allow for equality checks, if one needs to divide by A, then A can simply move to the other side of the equality sign. These limitations allow us for a performance trick, which is also used for the verification of BLS signatures. In a nutshell, a pairing is divided into two operations: (i) Miller loop, and (ii) final exponentiation. Both are expensive, but what we can do is first compute the Miller loop, which already maps two points from G1 and G2 to MlResult. Then we can use this result to perform the operations over these points (multiplications). Finally, when we want to check for equality, we invert one of the two points (or equivalently in this case we compute the conjugate), and multiply the result by the other point. Only now we compute the final exponentiation and verify that the result is the identity element. In other words:\nbls12_381_millerLoop\nfinalVerify\nA\nA\nbls12_381_millerLoop\nbls12_381_finalVerify\nWhile the results of the Miller loop are already elements in Fp12, they are not necessarily part of the group. This is why we call the type used in the built-ins bls12_381_MlResult rather than bls12_381_GT.\nbls12_381_MlResult\nbls12_381_GT\nUsing the estimates in the section Costing of functions, we can see how this representation of GT elements is beneficial. Assume that we want to check the following relation: e(A,B) * e(C,D) =? e(E,F) * e(G,H). The Miller loop takes around 330us, and the final exponentiation around 370us. A full pairing would be 700us, and therefore checking this relation would cost around 2,8ms. If, instead, we break down the pairing into a Miller loop and a final exponentiation, and only compute the latter once, the cost of the relation above would be 330 * 4 + 370 = 1.7ms.\nCosting of functions\ne(A,B) * e(C,D) =? e(E,F) * e(G,H)\nFor this reason it is important to limit what can be done with bls12_381_MlResult, as the pairing really is not the full pairing operation, but only the Miller loop.\nbls12_381_MlResult\nOther libraries of interest\nWe present what would be the alternatives of using pairings in the different use cases presented above.\nOne might be concerned of why we are exposing such low-level primitives, instead of exposing higher level protocol functions, such as VerifyBlsSignature or VerifyZKP. The motivation behind that is because pairings can enable a big number of use cases, and covering all of those can considerably extend the list of required functions.\nVerifyBlsSignature\nVerifyZKP\nThe BLS12-381 curve is fully defined by the following set of parameters (coefficient A=0 for all BLS12 curves).

Nonetheless, Zcash, MatterLabs and Consensys support BLS12-381 curve, so it is certainly widely used in the space.\nFurther reading regarding curve BLS12-381 can be found here and the references thereof cited.\nWe also have an analysis by Duncan Coutts for effects of including this library for continuous integration and long term maintainability:\nIn addition to security audits on the proposed implementation, it is important that we review the inclusion of the library for practical issues of build systems, and long term maintainability.\nIn particular in this case the library will be used in the chain format and in chain verification. This means we have special constraints that the format and verification logic must never change. Or more specifically: it must be possible forever to be able to verify the existing uses on the chain. So even if there are upgrades or format changes in future, it must still be possible to decode and verify the old uses. This is not a constraint that most software has, and so many libraries are not designed to work within that constraint.\nThe proposed implementation is https://github.com/supranational/blst\nSo overall this seems like something the core development team and Cardano community could support long term without too high a cost. Though we should be aware of the risk that we may have to support an old version of the library, if the library gets changed in incompatible ways.\nTo ensure no compatibility surprises, it is worth considering forking the repository at a specific commit/version and building the node using that version. This is to guarantee the version remains available. Then for any future updates, the fork repo could be updated to a new version explicitly, with appropriate compatibility checks to ensure the existing on-chain uses are still compatible.\nWe did some preliminary costing of the BLS functions and the following cost of the new built-in functions:\nbls12_381_G1_compress : 3341914 bls12_381_G1_uncompress : 16511372 bls12_381_G1_add : 1046420 bls12_381_G1_equal : 545063 bls12_381_G1_hashToCurve : 66311195 + 23097*x bls12_381_G1_scalarMul : 94607019 + 87060*x (we use 94955259, with x = 4) bls12_381_G1_neg : 292890 bls12_381_G2_compress : 3948421 bls12_381_G2_uncompress : 33114723 bls12_381_G2_add : 2359410 bls12_381_G2_equal : 1102635 bls12_381_G2_hashToCurve : 204557793 + 23271*x bls12_381_G2_scalarMul : 190191402 + 85902*x bls12_381_G2_neg : 307813 bls12_381_GT_finalVerify : 388656972 bls12_381_GT_millerLoop : 402099373 bls12_381_GT_mul : 2533975 blake2b_256 : 358499 + 10186*x (521475, with x = 16) addInteger : 85664 + 712*max(x,y) (88512, with x = y = 4) multiplyInteger : 1000 + 55553*(x+y) (641924, with x = y = 4, and we include the price of modular reduction, as we need one per mult) divideInteger : if x>y then 809015 + 577*x*y else 196500 modInteger : 196500 expInteger : We estimate 32 mults and adds (23373952)\nbls12_381_G1_compress : 3341914 bls12_381_G1_uncompress : 16511372 bls12_381_G1_add : 1046420 bls12_381_G1_equal : 545063 bls12_381_G1_hashToCurve : 66311195 + 23097*x bls12_381_G1_scalarMul : 94607019 + 87060*x (we use 94955259, with x = 4) bls12_381_G1_neg : 292890 bls12_381_G2_compress : 3948421 bls12_381_G2_uncompress : 33114723 bls12_381_G2_add : 2359410 bls12_381_G2_equal : 1102635 bls12_381_G2_hashToCurve : 204557793 + 23271*x bls12_381_G2_scalarMul : 190191402 + 85902*x bls12_381_G2_neg : 307813 bls12_381_GT_finalVerify : 388656972 bls12_381_GT_millerLoop : 402099373 bls12_381_GT_mul : 2533975 blake2b_256 : 358499 + 10186*x (521475, with x = 16) addInteger : 85664 + 712*max(x,y) (88512, with x = y = 4) multiplyInteger : 1000 + 55553*(x+y) (641924, with x = y = 4, and we include the price of modular reduction, as we need one per mult) divideInteger : if x>y then 809015 + 577*x*y else 196500 modInteger : 196500 expInteger : We estimate 32 mults and adds (23373952)\nUsing these preliminary benchmarks, we performed some estimates of how much it would cost to verify Groth16 or Plonk proofs using the bindings.

    "prompt": "CIP1694?",
    "completion": "We propose a revision of Cardano's on-chain governance system to support the new requirements for Voltaire. The existing specialized governance support for protocol parameter updates and MIR certificates will be removed, and two new fields will be added to normal transaction bodies for:\nAny Cardano user will be allowed to submit a governance action. We also introduce three distinct governance bodies that have specific functions in this new governance framework:\nEvery governance action must be ratified by at least two of these three governance bodies using their on-chain votes. The type of action and the state of the governance system determines which bodies must ratify it.\nRatified actions are then enacted on-chain, following a set of well-defined rules.\nAs with stake pools, any Ada holder may register to be a DRep and so choose to represent themselves and/or others. Also, as with stake pools, Ada holders may, instead, delegate their voting rights to any other DRep. Voting rights will be based on the total Ada that is delegated, as a whole number of Lovelace.\nThe most crucial aspect of this proposal is therefore the notion of \"one Lovelace = one vote\".\nFor the many contributors to this proposal, see Acknowledgements.\nWe're heading into the age of Voltaire, laying down the foundations for decentralized decision-making. This CIP describes a mechanism for on-chain governance that will underpin the Voltaire phase of Cardano. The CIP builds on and extends the original Cardano governance scheme that was based on a fixed number of governance keys. It aims to provide a first step that is both valuable and, importantly, is also technically achievable in the near term as part of the proposed Voltaire governance system.\nIt also seeks to act as a jumping-off point for continuing community input, including on appropriate threshold settings and other on-chain settings.\nSubsequent proposals may adapt and extend this proposal to meet emerging governance needs.\nThe on-chain Cardano governance mechanism that was introduced in the Shelley ledger era is capable of:\nIn the current scheme, governance actions are initiated by special transactions that require Quorum-Many authorizations from the governance keys (5 out of 7 on the Cardano mainnet)1. Fields in the transaction body provide details of the proposed governance action: either i) protocol parameter changes; or ii) initiating funds transfers. Each transaction can trigger both kinds of governance actions, and a single action can have more than one effect (e.g. changing two or more protocol parameters).\nQuorum-Many\nProperly authorized governance actions are applied on an epoch boundary (they are enacted).\nOne of the protocol parameters is sufficiently significant to merit special attention: changing the major protocol version enables Cardano to enact controlled hard forks. This type of protocol parameter update therefore has a special status, since stake pools must upgrade their nodes so they can support the new protocol version once the hard fork is enacted.\nThe Shelley governance design was intended to provide a simple, transitional approach to governance. This proposal aims to address a number of shortcomings with that design that are apparent as we move into Voltaire.\nThe Shelley governance design gives no room for active on-chain participation of Ada holders. While changes to the protocol are usually the results of discussions with selected community actors, the process is currently driven mainly by the founding entities. Ensuring that everyone can voice their concern is cumbersome, and can be perceived as arbitrary at times.\nMovements from the treasury constitute a critical and sensitive topic. However, they can be hard to track. It is important to have more transparency and more layers of control over these movements.\nWhile they need to be treated specially by SPOs, hard forks are not differentiated from other protocol parameter changes.\nFinally, while there is currently a somewhat common vision for Cardano that is shared by its founding entities and also by many community members, there is no clearly defined document where these guiding principles are recorded. It makes sense to leverage the Cardano blockchain to record the shared Cardano ethos in an immutable fashion, as a formal Cardano Constitution.\nThe following topics are considered to be out of the scope of this CIP.\nThis CIP focuses only on on-chain mechanisms. The provisions of the initial constitution are extremely important, as are any processes that will allow it to be amended. These merit their own separate and focused discussion.\nThis is an off-chain issue.\nAny potential legal enforcement of either the Cardano protocol or the Cardano Constitution are completely out of scope for this CIP.\nThe Cardano community must think deeply about the correct standards and processes for handling the creation of the governance actions that are specified in this CIP. In particular, the role of Project Catalyst in creating treasury withdrawal actions is completely outside the scope of this CIP.\nHow any private companies, public or private institutions, individuals etc. choose to hold or delegate their Ada, including delegation to stake pools or DReps, is outside the scope of this CIP.\nThe Cardano Constitution is a text document that defines Cardano's shared values and guiding principles. At this stage, the Constitution is an informational document that unambiguously captures the core values of Cardano and acts to ensure its long-term sustainability. At a later stage, we can imagine the Constitution perhaps evolving into a smart-contract based set of rules that drives the entire governance framework. For now, however, the Constitution will remain an off-chain document whose hash digest value will be recorded on-chain. As discussed above, the Constitution is not yet defined and its content is out of scope for this CIP.\nWe define a constitutional committee which represents a set of individuals or entities (each associated with a Ed25519 or native or Plutus script credential) that are collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitution is respected.\nThough it cannot be enforced on-chain, the constitutional committee is only supposed to vote on the constitutionality of governance actions (which should thus ensure the long-term sustainability of the blockchain) and should be replaced (via the no confidence action) if they overstep this boundary. Said differently, there is a social contract between the constitutional committee and the actors of the network. Although the constitutional committee could reject certain governance actions (by voting 'No' on them), they should only do so when those governance actions are in conflict with the Constitution.\nFor example, if we consider the hypothetical Constitution rule \"The Cardano network must always be able to produce new blocks\", then a governance action that would reduce the maximum block size to 0 would be, in effect, unconstitutional and so might not be ratified by the constitutional committee. The rule does not, however, specify the smallest acceptable maximum block size, so the constitutional committee would need to determine this number and vote accordingly.\n0\nThe constitutional committee is considered to be in one of the following two states at all times:\nIn a state of no-confidence, the current committee is no longer able to participate in governance actions and must be replaced before any governance actions can be ratified (see below).\nThe constitutional committee will use a hot and cold key setup, similar to the existing \"genesis delegation certificate\" mechanism.\nThe constitutional committee can be replaced via a specific governance action (\"Update committee\", described below) that requires the approval of both the SPOs and the DReps. The threshold for ratification might be different depending on if the governance is in a normal state or a state of no confidence.\nThe new constitutional committee could, in principle, be identical to or partially overlap the outgoing committee as long as the action is properly ratified. This might happen, for example, if the electorate has collective confidence in all or part of the committee and wishes to extend its term of office.\nUnlike the Shelley governance design, the size of the constitutional committee is not fixed and can be any nonnegative number. It may be changed whenever a new committee is elected (\"Update committee\"). Likewise, the committee threshold (the fraction of committee Yes votes that are required to ratify governance actions) is not fixed and can also be varied by the governance action. This gives a great deal of flexibility to the composition of the committee. In particular, it is possible to elect an empty committee if the community wishes to abolish the constitutional committee entirely. Note that this is different from a state of no-confidence and still constitutes a governance system capable of enacting proposals.\nYes\nThere will be a new protocol parameter for the minimal size of the committee, itself a nonnegative number called committeeMinSize.\ncommitteeMinSize\nEach newly elected constitutional committee will have a term. Per-member terms allow for a rotation scheme, such as a third of the committee expiring every year. Expired members can no longer vote. Member can also willingly resign early, which will be marked on-chain as an expired member.\nIf the number of non-expired committee members falls below the minimal size of the committee, the constitutional committee will be unable to ratify governance actions. This means that only governance actions that don't require votes from the constitutional committee can still be ratified.\nFor example, a committee of size five with a threshold of 60 a minimum size of three and two expired members can still pass governance actions if two non-expired members vote Yes. However, if one more member expires then the constitutional committee becomes unable to ratify any more governance actions.\nYes\nThe maximum term is a governance protocol parameter, specified as a number of epochs. During a state of no-confidence, no action can be ratified, so the committee should plan for its own replacement if it wishes to avoid disruption.\nWhile the constitution is an informal, off-chain document, there will also be an optional script that can enforce some guidelines. This script acts to supplement the constitutional committee by restricting some proposal types. For example, if the community wishes to have some hard rules for the treasury that cannot be violated, a script that enforces these rules can be voted in as the guardrails script.\nThe guardrails script applies only to protocol parameter update and treasury withdrawal proposals.\nWarning CIP-1694 DReps should not be conflated with Project Catalyst DReps.\nIn order to participate in governance, a stake credential must be delegated to a DRep. Ada holders will generally delegate their voting rights to a registered DRep that will vote on their behalf. In addition, two pre-defined voting options are available:\nAbstain\nAbstain\nIf an Ada holder delegates to Abstain, then their stake is actively marked as not participating in governance.\nAbstain\nThe effect of delegating to Abstain on chain is that the delegated stake will not be considered to be a part of the active voting stake. However, the stake will be considered to be registered for the purpose of the incentives that are described in Incentives for Ada holders to delegate voting stake.\nAbstain\nNo Confidence\nNo Confidence\nIf an Ada holder delegates to No Confidence, then their stake is counted as a Yes vote on every No Confidence action and a No vote on every other action. The delegated stake will be considered part of the active voting stake. It also serves as a directly auditable measure of the confidence of Ada holders in the constitutional committee.\nNo Confidence\nYes\nNo Confidence\nNo\nNote The pre-defined voting options do not cast votes inside of transactions, their behavior is accounted for at the protocol level. The Abstain option may be chosen for a variety of reasons, including the desire to not participate in the governance system.\nAbstain\nNote Any Ada holder may register themselves as a DRep and delegate to themselves if they wish to actively participate in voting.\nNote Any wallet serving as the Registered Reward Wallet for a Stake Pool can be delegated to one of these Pre-defined Voting Options and doing so will serve as the default voting option selected by the SPO for all Governance Action votes, excepting Hard Fork Governance Actions. Due to the need for robust consensus around Hard Fork initiations, these votes must be met as a percentage of the stake held by all stake pools.\nIn Voltaire, existing stake credentials will be able to delegate their stake to DReps for voting purposes, in addition to the current delegation to stake pools for block production. DRep delegation will mimic the existing stake delegation mechanisms (via on-chain certificates). Similarly, DRep registration will mimic the existing stake registration mechanisms. Additionally, registered DReps will need to vote regularly to still be considered active. Specifically, if a DRep does not submit any votes for drepActivity-many epochs, the DRep is considered inactive, where drepActivity is a new protocol parameter. Inactive DReps do not count towards the active voting stake anymore, and can become active again for drepActivity-many epochs by voting on any governance actions or submitting a DRep update certificate. The reason for marking DReps as inactive is so that DReps who stop participating but still have stake delegated to them do not eventually leave the system in a state where no governance action can pass.\ndrepActivity\ndrepActivity\ndrepActivity\nRegistered DReps are identified by a credential that can be either:\nThe blake2b-224 hash digest of a serialized DRep credential is called the DRep ID.\nThe following new types of certificates will be added for DReps: DRep registration certificates, DRep retirement certificates, and vote delegation certificates.\nDRep registration certificates include:\nAn anchor is a pair of:\nThe structure and format of this metadata is deliberately left open in this CIP. The on-chain rules will not check either the URL or the hash. Client applications should, however, perform the usual sanity checks when fetching content from the provided URL.\nDRep retirement certificates include:\nNote that a DRep is retired immediately upon the chain accepting a retirement certificate, and the deposit is returned as part of the transaction that submits the retirement certificate (the same way that stake credential registration deposits are returned).\nVote delegation certificates include:\nNote\nDRep delegation always maps a stake credential to a DRep credential. This means that a DRep cannot delegate voting stake to another DRep.\nThe authorization scheme (i.e. which signatures are required for registration, retirement or delegation) mimics the existing stake delegation certificate authorization scheme.\nIn addition to the existing per-stake-credential distribution and the per-stake-pool distribution, the ledger will now also determine the per-DRep stake distribution. This distribution will determine how much stake each vote from a DRep is backed by.\nWarning\nUnlike the distribution that is used for block production, we will always use the most current version of the per-DRep stake distribution as given on the epoch boundary.\nThis means that for any topic which individual voters care deeply about, they have time to delegate to themselves as a DRep and vote directly. However, it means that there may be a difference between the stake that is used for block production and the stake that is used for voting in any given epoch.\nThere will be a short bootstrapping phase during which rewards will be earned for stake delegation etc. and may be withdrawn at any time. After this phase, although rewards will continue to be earned for block delegation etc., reward accounts will be blocked from withdrawing any rewards unless their associated stake credential is also delegated to a DRep or pre-defined voting option. This helps to ensure high participation, and so, legitimacy.\nNote\nEven though rewards cannot be withdrawn, they are not lost. As soon as a stake credential is delegated (including to a pre-defined voting option), the rewards can be withdrawn.\nDReps arguably need to be compensated for their work. Research on incentive models is still ongoing, and we do not wish to hold up implementation of this CIP while this is resolved.\nOur interim proposal is therefore to escrow Lovelace from the existing Cardano treasury until this extremely important decision can be agreed on by the community, through the on-chain governance mechanism that is being constructed.\nAlternatively, DReps could pay themselves through instances of the \"Treasury withdrawal\" governance action. Such an action would be auditable on-chain, and should reflect an off-chain agreement between DReps and delegators.\nWe define seven different types of governance actions. A governance action is an on-chain event that is triggered by a transaction and has a deadline after which it cannot be enacted.\nAny Ada holder can submit a governance action to the chain. They must provide a deposit of govActionDeposit Lovelace, which will be returned when the action is finalized (whether it is ratified or has expired). The deposit amount will be added to the deposit pot, similar to stake key deposits. It will also be counted towards the stake of the reward address it will be paid back to, to not reduce the submitter's voting power to vote on their own (and competing) actions.\ngovActionDeposit\nIf a guardrails script is present, the transaction must include that script in the witness set either directly, or via reference inputs, and any other requirements that the guardrails script makes must be satisfied.\nNote that a motion of no-confidence is an extreme measure that enables Ada holders to revoke the power that has been granted to the current constitutional committee.\nNote A single governance action might contain multiple protocol parameter updates. Many parameters are inter-connected and might require moving in lockstep.\nGovernance actions are ratified through on-chain voting actions. Different kinds of governance actions have different ratification requirements but always involve two of the three governance bodies, with the exception of a hard-fork initiation and security-relevant protocol parameters, which requires ratification by all governance bodies. Depending on the type of governance action, an action will thus be ratified when a combination of the following occurs:\nYes\nYes\nYes\nWarning As explained above, different stake distributions apply to DReps and SPOs.\nA successful motion of no-confidence, update of the constitutional committee, a constitutional change, or a hard-fork, delays ratification of all other governance actions until the first epoch after their enactment. This gives an updated constitutional committee enough time to vote on current proposals, re-evaluate existing proposals with respect to a new constitution, and ensures that the in principle arbitrary semantic changes caused by enacting a hard-fork do not have unintended consequences in combination with other actions.\nThe following table details the ratification requirements for each governance action scenario. The columns represent:\nGovernance action type The type of governance action. Note that the protocol parameter updates are grouped into four categories.\nConstitutional committee (abbrev. CC) A value of indicates that the constitutional committee must approve this action. A value of - means that constitutional committee votes do not apply.\nDReps The DRep vote threshold that must be met as a percentage of active voting stake.\nSPOs The SPO vote threshold which must be met as a certain threshold of the total active voting stake, excepting Hard Fork Governance Actions. Due to the need for robust consensus around Hard Fork initiations, these votes must be met as a percentage of the stake held by all stake pools. A value of - means that SPO votes do not apply.\nEach of these thresholds is a governance parameter. There is one additional threshold, Q5, related to security relevant protocol parameters, which is explained below. The initial thresholds should be chosen by the Cardano community as a whole. All thresholds for the Info action are set to 100 since setting it any lower would result in not being able to poll above the threshold.\nQ5\nSome parameters are relevant to security properties of the system. Any proposal attempting to change such a parameter requires an additional vote of the SPOs, with the threshold Q5.\nQ5\nThe security relevant protocol parameters are:\nmaxBlockBodySize\nmaxTxSize\nmaxBlockHeaderSize\nmaxValueSize\nmaxBlockExecutionUnits\ntxFeePerByte\ntxFeeFixed\nutxoCostPerByte\ngovActionDeposit\nminFeeRefScriptCostPerByte\nNote It may make sense for some or all thresholds to be adaptive with respect to the Lovelace that is actively registered to vote. For example, a threshold could vary between 51 for a high level of registration and 75 for a low level registration. Moreover, the treasury threshold could also be adaptive, depending on the total Lovelace that is being withdrawn, or different thresholds could be set for different levels of withdrawal.\nNote To achieve legitimacy, the minimum acceptable threshold should be no less than 50 of the delegated stake.\nApart from Treasury withdrawals and Infos, we include a mechanism for ensuring that governance actions of the same type do not accidentally clash with each other in an unexpected way.\nEach governance action must include the governance action ID for the most recently enacted action of its given type. This means that two actions of the same type can be enacted at the same time, but they must be deliberately designed to do so.\nActions that have been ratified in the current epoch are prioritized as follows for enactment:\nNote Info actions cannot be ratified or enacted, since they do not have any effect on the protocol.\nGovernance actions are enacted in order of acceptance to the chain. This resolves conflicts where, e.g. there are two competing parameter changes.\nGovernance actions are checked for ratification only on an epoch boundary. Once ratified, actions are staged for enactment.\nAll submitted governance actions will therefore either:\nIn all of those cases, deposits are returned immediately.\nAll governance actions are enacted on the epoch boundary after their ratification.\nEvery governance action will include the following:\nIn addition, each action will include some elements that are specific to its type:\nNote The new major protocol version must be precisely one greater than the current protocol version. Any two consecutive epochs will therefore either have the same major protocol version, or the later one will have a major protocol version that is one greater.\nNote There can be no duplicate committee members - each pair of credentials in a committee must be unique.\nEach governance action that is accepted on the chain will be assigned a unique identifier (a.k.a. the governance action ID), consisting of the transaction hash that created it and the index within the transaction body that points to it.\nWe have grouped the protocol parameter changes by type, allowing different thresholds to be set for each group.\nWe are not, however, restricting each protocol parameter governance action to be contained within one group. In case where a governance action carries updates for multiple parameters from different groups, the maximum threshold of all the groups involved will apply to any given such governance action.\nThe network, economic and technical parameter groups collect existing protocol parameters that were introduced during the Shelley, Alonzo and Babbage eras. In addition, we introduce a new governance group that is specific to the new governance parameters that will be introduced by CIP-1694.\nThe network group consists of:\nmaxBlockBodySize\nmaxTxSize\nmaxBlockHeaderSize\nmaxValueSize\nmaxTxExecutionUnits\nmaxBlockExecutionUnits\nmaxCollateralInputs\nThe economic group consists of:\ntxFeePerByte\ntxFeeFixed\nstakeAddressDeposit\nstakePoolDeposit\nmonetaryExpansion\ntreasuryCut\nminPoolCost\nutxoCostPerByte\nexecutionUnitPrices\nThe technical group consists of:\npoolPledgeInfluence\npoolRetireMaxEpoch\nstakePoolTargetNum\ncostModels\ncollateralPercentage\nThe governance group consists of all the new protocol parameters that are introduced in this CIP:\ngovActionLifetime\ngovActionDeposit\ndRepDeposit\ndRepActivity\ncommitteeMinSize\ncommitteeMaxTermLength\nEach vote transaction consists of the following:\nFor SPOs and DReps, the number of votes that are cast (whether 'Yes', 'No' or 'Abstain') is proportional to the Lovelace that is delegated to them at the point the action is checked for ratification. For constitututional committee members, each current committee member has one vote.\nWarning 'Abstain' votes are not included in the \"active voting stake\".\nNote that an explicit vote to abstain differs from abstaining from voting. Unregistered stake that did not vote behaves like an 'Abstain' vote, while registered stake that did not vote behaves like a 'No' vote. To avoid confusion, we will only use the word 'Abstain' from this point onward to mean an on-chain vote to abstain.\nThe governance credential witness will trigger the appropriate verifications in the ledger according to the existing UTxOW ledger rule (i.e. a signature check for verification keys, and a validator execution with a specific vote redeemer and new Plutus script purpose for scripts).\nUTxOW\nVotes can be cast multiple times for each governance action by a single credential. Correctly submitted votes override any older votes for the same credential and role. That is, the voter may change their position on any action if they choose. As soon as a governance action is ratified, voting ends and transactions containing further votes are invalid.\nWhen a governance action is successfully submitted to the chain, its progress will be tracked by the ledger state. In particular, the following will be tracked:\nSince the stake snapshot changes at each epoch boundary, a new tally must be calculated when each unratified governance action is checked for ratification. This means that an action could be enacted even though the DRep or SPO votes have not changed (since the vote delegation could have changed).\nWe define a number of new terms related to voting stake:\nP\nYes\nP\nAt first sight, the constitutional committee may appear to be a special committee that has been granted extra power over DReps. However, because DReps can replace the constitutional committee at any time and DRep votes are also required to ratify every governance action, the constitutional committee has no more (and may, in fact, have less) power than the DReps. Given this, what role does the committee play, and why is it not superfluous? The answer is that the committee solves the bootstrapping problem of the new governance framework. Indeed, as soon as we pull the trigger and enable this framework to become active on-chain, then without a constitutional committee, there would rapidly need to be sufficient DReps, so that the system did not rely solely on SPO votes. We cannot yet predict how active the community will be in registering as DReps, nor how reactive other Ada holders will be regarding delegation of votes.\nThus, the constitutional committee comes into play to make sure that the system can transition from its current state into fully decentralized governance in due course. Furthermore, in the long run, the committee can play a mentoring and advisory role in the governance decisions by being a set of elected representatives who are put under the spotlight for their judgment and guidance in governance decisions. Above all, the committee is required at all times to adhere to the Constitution and to ratify proposals in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.\nNote that this CIP does not mention any kind of identity validation or verification for the members of the constitutional committee or the DReps.\nThis is intentional.\nWe hope that the community will strongly consider only voting for and delegating to those DReps who provide something like a DID to identify themselves. However, enforcing identity verification is very difficult without some centralized oracle, which we consider to be a step in the wrong direction.\nVarious mechanisms, such as quadratic voting, have been proposed to guard against entities with a large amount of influence. In a system based on \"1 Lovelace, 1 vote\", however, it is trivially easy to split stake into small amounts and undo the protections. Without an on-chain identity verification system we cannot adopt any such measures.\nThe Cardano protocol is based on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, so using a stake-based governance approach is sensible. However, there are many ways that could be used to define how to record the stake distribution between participants. As a reminder, network addresses can currently contain two sets of credentials: one to identify who can unlock funds at an address (a.k.a. payment credentials) and one that can be delegated to a stake pool (a.k.a. delegation credentials).\nRather than defining a third set of credentials, we instead propose to re-use the existing delegation credentials, using a new on-chain certificate to determine the governance stake distribution. This implies that the set of DReps can (and likely will) differ from the set of SPOs, so creating balance. On the flip side, it means that the governance stake distribution suffers from the same shortcomings as that for block production: for example, wallet software providers must support multi-delegation schemes and must facilitate the partitioning of stake into sub-accounts should an Ada holder desire to delegate to multiple DReps, or an Ada holder must manually split their holding if their wallet does not support this.\nHowever, this choice also limits future implementation effort for wallet providers and minimizes the effort that is needed for end-users to participate in the governance protocol. The latter is a sufficiently significant concern to justify the decision. By piggybacking on the existing structure, the system remains familiar to users and reasonably easy to set up. This maximizes both the chance of success of, and the rate of participation in, the governance framework.\nIn contrast to other protocol parameter updates, hard forks (or, more correctly, changes to the protocol's major version number) require much more attention. Indeed, while other protocol parameter changes can be performed without significant software changes, a hard fork assumes that a super-majority of the network has upgraded the Cardano node to support the new set of features that are introduced by the upgrade. This means that the timing of a hard fork event must be communicated well ahead of time to all Cardano users, and requires coordination between stake pool operators, wallet providers, DApp developers, and the node release team.\nHence, this proposal, unlike the Shelley scheme, promotes hard fork initiations as a standalone governance action, distinct from protocol parameter updates.\nNothing in this proposal limits SPOs from becoming DReps. Why do we have DReps at all? The answer is that SPOs are chosen purely for block production and not all SPOs will want to become DReps. Voters can choose to delegate their vote to DReps without needing to consider whether they are also a good block producer, and SPOs can choose to represent Ada holders or not.\nThe requirements in the ratification requirement table are explained here. Most of the governance actions have the same kind of requirements: the constitutional committee and the DReps must reach a sufficient number of 'Yes' votes. This includes these actions:\nA motion of no-confidence represents a lack of confidence by the Cardano community in the current constitutional committee, and hence the constitutional committee should not be included in this type of governance action. In this situation, the SPOs and the DReps are left to represent the will of the community.\nSimilar to the motion of no-confidence, electing a constitutional committee depends on both the SPOs and the DReps to represent the will of the community.\nWhile not binding on chain, the Info governance action could be useful in an number of situations. These include:\nRegardless of any governance mechanism, SPO participation is needed for any hard fork since they must upgrade their node software. For this reason, we make their cooperation explicit in the hard fork initiation governance action, by always requiring their vote. The constitutional committee also votes, signaling the constitutionality of a hard fork. The DReps also vote, to represent the will of every stake holder.\nThe governance actions, the votes and the certificates and the Constitution use new metadata fields, in the form of URLs and integrity hashes (mirroring the metadata structure for stake pool registration). The metadata is used to provide context. Governance actions need to explain why the action is needed, what experts were consulted, etc. Since transaction size constraints should not limit this explanatory data, we use URLs instead.\nThis does, however, introduce new problems. If a URL does not resolve, what should be the expectation for voting on that action? Should we expect everyone to vote 'No'? Is this an attack vector against the governance system? In such a scenario, the hash pre-image could be communicated in other ways, but we should be prepared for the situation. Should there be a summary of the justification on chain?\nInstead of specific dedicated fields in the transaction format, we could instead use the existing transaction metadata field.\nGovernance-related metadata can be clearly identified by registering a CIP-10 metadata label. Within that, the structure of the metadata can be determined by this CIP (exact format TBD), using an index to map the vote or governance action ID to the corresponding metadata URL and hash.\nThis avoids the need to add additional fields to the transaction body, at the risk of making it easier for submitters to ignore. However, since the required metadata can be empty (or can point to a non-resolving URL), it is already easy for submitters to not provide metadata, and so it is unclear whether this makes the situation worse.\nNote that transaction metadata is never stored in the ledger state, so it would be up to clients to pair the metadata with the actions and votes in this alternative, and would not be available as a ledger state query.\nSince governance actions are available for anyone to submit, we need some mechanism to prevent those individuals responsible for voting from becoming overwhelmed with a flood of proposals. A large deposit is one such mechanism, but this comes at the unfortunate cost of being a barrier for some people to submit an action. Note, however, that crowd-sourcing with a Plutus script is always an option to gather the deposit.\nWe could, alternatively, accept the possibility of a large number of actions active at any given time, and instead depend on off-chain socialization to guide voters' attention to those that merit it. In this scenario, the constitutional committee might choose to only consider proposals which have already garnered enough votes from the DReps.\nAn earlier draft of this CIP included the notion of an \"active voting stake threshold\", or AVST. The purpose of AVST was to ensure the legitimacy of each vote, removing the possibility that, for example, 9 out of 10 Lovelace could decide the fate of millions of entities on Cardano. There are really two concerns here, which are worth separating.\nThe first concern is that of bootstrapping the system, i.e. reaching the initial moment when sufficient stake is registered to vote. The second concern is that the system could lose participation over time. One problem with the AVST is that it gives an incentive for SPOs to desire a low voting registration (since their votes then hold more weight). This is absolutely not a slight on the existing SPOs, but an issue with bad incentives.\nWe have chosen, therefore, to solve the two concerns differently. We solve the bootstrapping problem as described in the section on bootstrapping. We solve the long-term participation problem by not allowing reward withdrawals (after the bootstrap phase) unless the stake is delegated to a DRep (including the two special cases, namely 'Abstain' and 'No confidence').\nTALLY\nGOV\nQ_5\nThe features in this CIP require a hard fork.\nThis document describes an ambitious change to Cardano governance. We propose to implement the changes via two hard forks: the first one containing all new features but some being disabled for a bootstrap period and the second one enabling all features.\nIn the following sections, we give more details about the various implementation work items that have already been identified. In addition, the final section exposes a few open questions which will need to be finalized. We hope that those questions can be addressed through community workshops and discussions.\nThe ratification of this proposal is something of a circular problem: we need some form of governance framework in order to agree on what the final governance framework should be. As has been stated many times, CIPs are not authoritative, nor are they a governance mechanism. Rather, they describe technical solutions that have been deemed sound (from a technical standpoint) by community of experts.\nCIP-1694 arguably goes beyond the usual scope of the CIP process and there is a strong desire to ratify this CIP through some process. However, that process is yet to be defined and it remains an open question. The final ratification process is likely to be a blend of various ideas, such as:\nNew elements will be added to the transaction body, and existing update and MIR capabilities will be removed. In particular,\nThe governance actions and votes will comprise two new transaction body fields.\nThree new kinds of certificates will be added in addition to the existing ones:\nAnd similarly, the current MIR and genesis certificates will be removed.\nA new Voting purpose will be added to Plutus script contexts. This will provide, in particular, the vote to on-chain scripts.\nVoting\nWarning As usual, we will provide a CDDL specification for each of those changes.\nThe PPUP transition rule will be rewritten and moved out of the UTxO rule and into the LEDGER rule as a new GOV rule.\nPPUP\nUTxO\nLEDGER\nGOV\nIt will process and record the governance actions and votes.\nThe NEWEPOCH transition rule will be modified.\nNEWEPOCH\nThe MIR sub-rule will be removed.\nMIR\nA new RATIFY rule will be introduced to stage governance actions for enactment.\nRATIFY\nIt will ratify governance actions, and stage them for enactment in the current or next epoch, as appropriate.\nA new ENACTMENT rule will be called immediately after the EPOCH rule. This rule will enact governance actions that have previously been ratified.\nENACTMENT\nEPOCH\nThe EPOCH rule will no longer call the NEWPP sub-rule or compute whether the quorum is met on the PPUP state.\nEPOCH\nNEWPP\nThe on-chain governance workload is large, but the off-chain workload for tools and applications will arguably be even larger. To build an effective governance ecosystem, the ledger will have to provide interfaces to various governance elements.\nWhile votes and DReps (de)registrations are directly visible in blocks and will, therefore, be accessible via the existing local-chain-sync protocols; we will need to upgrade the local-state-query protocol to provide extra insights on information which are harder to infer from blocks (i.e. those that require maintaining a ledger state). New state queries should cover (at least):\nWe will need to be careful how we bootstrap this fledgling government. All the parties that are involved will need ample time to register themselves and to become familiar with the process.\nSpecial provisions will apply in the initial bootstrap phase. Firstly, during the bootstrap phase, a vote from the constitutional committee is sufficient to change the protocol parameters. Secondly, during the bootstrap phase, a vote from the constitutional committee, together with a sufficient SPO vote, is sufficient to initiate a hard fork. Thirdly, info actions will be available. No other actions other than those mentioned in this paragraph are possible during the bootstrap phase.\nThe bootstrap phase ends when the Constitutional Committee and SPOs ratify a subsequent hard fork, enabling the remaining governance actions and DRep participation. This is likely to be a number of months after the Chang hard fork. Although all features will be technically available at this point, additional requirements for using each feature may be specified in the constitution.\nMoreover, there will be an interim Constitutional committee with a set term, also specified in the next ledger era configuration file. The rotational schedule of the first non-interim committee could be included in the constitution itself. Note, however, that since the constitutional committee never votes on new committees, it cannot actually enforce the rotation.\nThe SPO vote could additionally be weighted by each SPO's pledge. This would provide a mechanism for allowing those with literal stake in the game to have a stronger vote. The weighting should be carefully chosen.\nA DRep could optionally list another DRep credential in their registration certificate. Upon retirement, all of the DRep's delegations would be automatically transferred to the given DRep credential. If that DRep had already retired, the delegation would be transfer to the 'Abstain' voting option.\nSince the DRep registration does not perform any necessary functions, the certificates for (de-)registering DReps could be removed. This makes the democracy more liquid since it removes some bureaucracy and also removes the need for the DRep deposit, at the cost of moving the anchor that is part of the DRep registration certificate into the transaction metadata.\nThe deposit that is attached to governance actions exists to prevent a flood of non-serious governance actions, each of which would require time and attention from the Cardano community. We could reduce this deposit for proposals which go through some agreed upon off-chain process. This would be marked on-chain by the endorsement of at least one constitutional committee member. The downside of this idea is that it gives more power to the constitutional committee.\nMultiple workshops for this CIP have proposed to introduce a different deposit amount for each type of governance action. It was not clear whether a majority was in favor of this idea, but this may be considered if it becomes clear that it is necessary.\nAs a further guarantee to ensure governance actions cannot be proposed right before a hard fork, be voted on by one DRep with a large amount of stake and be enacted immediately, there could be an additional requirement that a certain fixed absolute amount of stake needs to cast a 'Yes' vote on the action to be enacted.\nThis does not seem necessary in the current design, since the stake of all registered DReps behaves like a 'No' vote until they have actually cast a vote. This means that for this scenario to occur, the malicious actor needs at least to be in control of the fraction of DRep stake corresponding to the relevant threshold, at which point this might as well be considered a legitimate action.\nSome hard-forks require new genesis configurations. This has been the case for the Shelley and Alonzo hard forks (but not Allegra, Mary, Vasil or Valentine), may be the case in the future. At the moment, this proposal doesn't state anything about such a genesis configuration: it is implicitly assumed to be an off-chain agreement. We could however, enforce that (the hash of) a specific genesis configuration is also captured within a hard-fork governance action.\nAs discussed above, it may make sense for some or all thresholds to be adaptive with respect to the Lovelace that is actively registered to vote, so that the system provides greater legitimacy when there is only a low level of active voting stake. The bootstrapping mechanism that is proposed above may subsume this, however, by ensuring that the governance system is activated only when a minimum level of stake has been delegated to DReps.\nIt has been stated several times that \"DReps\" as presented here, might be confused with Project Catalst DReps. Similarly, some people have expressed confusion between the state of no-confidence, the motion of no-confidence and the no-confidence voting option.\nWe could imagine finding better terms for these concepts.\nNothing prevents money being taken out of the treasury other than the proposed votes and voting thresholds. Given that the Cardano treasury is a quite fundamental component of its monetary policy, we could imagine enforcing (at the protocol level) the maximum amount that can removed from the treasury over any period of time.\nMany people have stated that they believe that the actual voting turnout will not be so large as to be a strain on the throughput of the system. We also believe that this is likely to be the case, but when the bootstrap phase ends we might put one final, temporary safety measure in place (this will also allow us to justify a low DRep deposit amount).\nFor values of XXX and YYY that are still to be determined, as soon as the bootstrap phase has ended, when we calculate the DReps stake distribution for the next epoch boundary, we will consider only those DReps that are either in the top XXX-many DReps ranked by stake amount, or those DReps that have at least YYY Lovelace. Every epoch, the value of XXX will increase and the value of YYY will decrease, so that eventually XXX will be effectively infinite and YYY will be zero. Note that this is only an incentive, and nothing actually stops any DRep from casting their vote (though it will not be counted if it does not meet the requirements).\nIf the community decides at some point that there is indeed a problem with congestion, then a hard fork could be enacted that limits the number of DReps in a more restrictive way.\nReasonable numbers for the initial value of XXX are probably 5,000-10,000. Reasonable numbers for the initial value of YYY are probably the total number of Lovelace divided by the initial value of XXX.\nThe mechanism should be set to relax at a rate where the restriction is completely eliminated after a period of six months to one year.\nMany people have commented on and contributed to the first draft of this document, which was published in November 2022.

This document is a follow-up of this CIP specifying how stake pool cold keys should be derived.\n(Hierarchical) deterministic derivation of stake pool cold keys enables their restorability from a seed and most importantly, their management on hardware wallet devices. This in turn mitigates man-in-the middle attacks to which pool operators would otherwise be vulnerable if they managed their stake pool cold keys on a device not specifically hardened against alteration of the data to be signed/serialized without operator's explicit consent.\nUsing 1853' as the purpose field, we define the following derivation path structure for stake pool cold keys:\n1853'\nm / purpose' / coin_type' / usecase' / cold_key_index'\nm / purpose' / coin_type' / usecase' / cold_key_index'\nExample: m / 1853' / 1815' / 0' / 0'\nm / 1853' / 1815' / 0' / 0'\nHere the usecase is currently fixed to 0'.\nusecase\n0'\nGiven that stake pool cold keys are cryptographically the same as wallet keys already covered in CIP-1852, the master node and subsequent child keys derivation MUST be implemented in the same way as specified for wallets in CIP-1852.\nStake pools are not wallets and the core concept of \"accounts\" is not applicable to them, nor are they supposed to be related to a user's wallet in any meaningful way. Therefore treating stake pool cold keys as another \"chain\" within CIP-1852 specification would rather be a deviation from CIP-1852 than its logical extension. Hence we establish a separate purpose and path structure for stake pool cold keys, having their specifics and differences from standard \"wallet\" keys in mind.\ncoin_type\ncoin_type is kept in order to remain consistent with the \"parent\" CIP-1852 and also to leave space for the possibility that some Cardano hard-fork/clone in the future would reuse this specification to derive their own stake pool cold keys.\ncoin_type\nusecase\nSimilarly as we have the chain path component in CIP-1852 paths for different types of wallet keys, it's plausible that in the future, there could be multiple varieties of stake pools.

    "completion": "This document describes how to realize multi-parties transactions in Cardano. It is defined as an alternative to CIP-1852 for Cardano HD wallets. This specification does not cover the transport and sharing of partially signed transactions which is / will be covered in another document.\nMultisig wallets are Cardano wallets capable of providing and tracking keys involved in multi-parties transactions. Such transactions are used to move funds from addresses where (typically) more than one user must sign transactions for its funds to be spent. A simple analogue is a joint bank account where two account holders must approve withdrawals from the account. Cardano has native support for multi-signature schemes: funds at a multi-signature script address are owned by a monetary script, which specifies one or more combinations of cryptographic signatures which must be present to unlock funds at the address (see the Formal Ledger Spec, Figure 4: Multi-signature via Native Scripts). In a similar fashion, Cardano multisig scripts can also be used to capture stake rights on a particular address, shared between different parties.\nIn the Shelley era, Cardano offers six (partially overlapping) primitives for constructing monetary scripts which are summarized as the following grammar:\nSCRIPT = SIGNATURE KEY-HASH | ALL-OF 1*SCRIPT | ANY-OF 1*SCRIPT | N-OF UINT 1*SCRIPT | AFTER SLOT-NO | BEFORE SLOT-NO KEY-HASH = 28OCTET SLOT-NO = UINT\nSCRIPT = SIGNATURE KEY-HASH | ALL-OF 1*SCRIPT | ANY-OF 1*SCRIPT | N-OF UINT 1*SCRIPT | AFTER SLOT-NO | BEFORE SLOT-NO KEY-HASH = 28OCTET SLOT-NO = UINT\nScripts are thereby recursive structures which can contain scripts themselves. For example, a joint account between two parties which specifies that any of the two members can spend from it would be defined in pseudo-code as:\nJOINT-ACCOUNT := ANY-OF [SIGNATURE key-hash#1, SIGNATURE key-hash#2]\nJOINT-ACCOUNT := ANY-OF [SIGNATURE key-hash#1, SIGNATURE key-hash#2]\nIn order to spend from such script, one would have to provide a witness showing ownership of the key associated with either of key-hash#1 or key-hash#2 (or possibly, both).\nkey-hash#1\nkey-hash#2\nThe creation of a multisig address will not be covered in this document. Such addresses are described in [Shelley design specification - section 3.2 - Addresses and Credentials][delegation_design.pdf] and are obtained by serializing and hashing a multisig script. This functionality is assumed to be available through existing tooling or piece of software in a variety of ways.\nIn order to spend from a multisig address, one must provide a special witness in the spending transaction called a \"multisig witness\". Such witness must be the exact script used as an input for creating the hash part of the multisig address. Then, any additional required verification key signatures specified by the script must be provided as separate verification key witnesses (i.e. signatures of the hashed transaction body for each signing key).\nThis means that a wallet software has access to the full script to validate and also identify verification key hashes present in transactions, but only does so when funds are being spent from a multisig address! From the Allegra era and beyond, it is also possible to include script pre-image in transaction auxiliary data. Softwares may use this to communicate scripts ahead of time.\nWe consider the following HD derivation paths similarly to CIP-1852:\nm / purpose' / coin_type' / account_ix' / role / index\nm / purpose' / coin_type' / account_ix' / role / index\nTo associate multi-signature keys to a wallet, we reserve however purpose=1854' to distinguish multisig wallets from standard wallets. The coin type remains coin_type=1815' to identify Ada as registered in SLIP-0044. The account index (account_ix) may vary across the whole hardened domain. role=0 is used to identify payment keys, whereas role=2 identifies stake keys. role=1 is left unused for multisig wallets. Finally, the last index may vary across the whole soft domain, but according to the following rules:\npurpose=1854'\ncoin_type=1815'\naccount_ix\nrole=0\nrole=2\nrole=1\nindex\nWe can summarize the various paths and their respective domain in the following table:\npurpose\ncoin_type\naccount_ix\nrole\nindex\n1854'\n1815'\n[2^31 .. 2^32-1]\n0\n2\n[0 .. 2^31-1]\nm/1854’/1815’/0’/0/0\nm/1854’/1815’/0’/2/14\nm/1854’/1815’/0’/2/42\nm/1854’/1815’/0’/0/1337\nMulti-signatures payment verification and signing keys (role=0) with chain code should be presented bech32-encoded using addr_shared_xvk and addr_shared_xsk prefixes respectively, as specified in CIP-5.

Only the instantiated script appears on the blockchain.\nNOTE 2: As a reminder, a Cardano address is made of two parts: a payment part and a delegation part. The latter is optional and so is the delegation script template. If none is provided then the address does not contain any delegation part. Wallet softwares should decide whether they want to allow or forbid this but this proposal does not take position.\nThere must be a strict one-to-one mapping between the tags used in the template and the cosigner account keys provided. When a new address is needed, the software must instantiate the script by using keys derived from the relevant account. To instantiate a script from a template, a wallet software must abide by the following rules:\n(1) and (2) implies that a given instance of a script is associated to one and only one derivation index.\nNOTE 3: Wallet software should not authorize users to update the script templates after an address has been used.\nFor example, considering the joint-account example from above, an example of payment template can simply be:\nJOINT-ACCOUNT-TEMPLATE := ANY-OF [ SIGNATURE cosigner#1 , SIGNATURE cosigner#2 ]\nJOINT-ACCOUNT-TEMPLATE := ANY-OF [ SIGNATURE cosigner#1 , SIGNATURE cosigner#2 ]\nand an instantiation of that template for e.g. an index equals to 1 could be:\nJOINT-ACCOUNT := ANY-OF [ SIGNATURE addr_shared_vkh1rcw47lrnczf8d4gt7d8vp6z95l8effslyejszez7069z6fa469v , SIGNATURE addr_shared_vkh1f8vd0s83hr7y2r96gct785e4d0d77ep9jn5wqfa4d6r4kqzxd65 ]\nJOINT-ACCOUNT := ANY-OF [ SIGNATURE addr_shared_vkh1rcw47lrnczf8d4gt7d8vp6z95l8effslyejszez7069z6fa469v , SIGNATURE addr_shared_vkh1f8vd0s83hr7y2r96gct785e4d0d77ep9jn5wqfa4d6r4kqzxd65 ]\nKeys used in the instantiated template all come from the same derivation index for all cosigners. This allows all wallets to easily find back what indexes other cosigners used to derive a particular key (the same as they use for a particular address).\nIn case the wallet needs a change address internally, it must use the smallest unused indexes known, in ascending order. An index is considered unused if there's no transaction in the ledger with a script using its corresponding key hash. When constructing a transaction, a wallet should use UTxOs associated with script addresses only (hybrid transactions using non-shared UTxOs are forbidden).\nOnce constructed, a transaction must be signed with all required private keys from the initiator. The initiator must also include all instances of scripts necessary (typically one per input) and then either broadcast the transaction to its cosigners or submits it to the network if valid. The mean by which the transaction is broadcast is out of the scope of this specification.\nUpon receiving a partially signed transaction, wallets must for each input:\nNOTE The step (5) is crucial and implies that wallets initiating transactions have to sign them before broadcasting them as a proof of provenance. Otherwise it is possible for attackers to broadcast a \"fake\" transaction to all cosigners who may not pay attention to its details.\nWhen valid, the wallet should prompt the user for signing. The transaction can be submitted by any of the cosigners who deems it valid (it could be that only a subset of the cosigners is required to sign). Several cosigners may submit the transaction concurrently without issue, the ledger will ensure that only one transaction eventually get through.\nNOTE: The management of change addresses is an implementation detail of the wallet so long as all change addresses abide by the rules described earlier in this section. A wallet may choose to generate a single change address per transaction, while another may chose to generate many.\nWallets should warn users when discovering known keys in scripts which non-matching templates. Such addresses should not be included as part of the wallet's UTxO and should be treated as anomalies in the wallet. As a matter of facts, everything described in this document is a mere convention between wallets. There's however nothing at the protocol level that enforces that this specification is followed. It is therefore very much possible for advanced users to use their multisig keys in scripts that are different from the template. So long as indexes used are discoverable by the wallet, then such scripts are also discoverable.\nHowever, because such scripts / addresses would not have been created by the wallet, they are considered not being part of the it altogether and would not count towards the wallet's balance. Software should however as much as possible alert users about the existence of such anomalies.\nFor example, if Alice and Bob wants to share a wallet by requiring a signature from each other on every payment, they can define the following payment script template:\nALL-OF (SIGNATURE alice) (SIGNATURE bob)\nALL-OF (SIGNATURE alice) (SIGNATURE bob)\nAfter exchanging their corresponding public keys, both wallets should be initialized and present to Alice and Bob exactly 20 identical addresses, where each address is associated with exactly one derivation index. The first address will use one key from Alice's wallet at path m/1854 /1815 /0 /0/0 and a key from Bob's at exactly the same path. The next address will use keys at path m/1854 /1815 /0 /0/1 and so forth.\n20\nm/1854’/1815’/0’/0/0\nm/1854’/1815’/0’/0/1\nWhen Alice initiates a transaction from this wallet, she'll construct the transaction body, sign it with her corresponding private key, include an instance of the script as witness and broadcast the transaction to Bob via Telegram. Upon reception, Bob is able to verify that the transaction was indeed signed by Alice using her private key at index #0 (Bob has indeed Alice's parent public key in its possession and is therefore able to derive a child key at index #0 to verify the signature on the transaction). Bob proceeds with the payment by signing the transaction in return and submitting it.\nMultisig keys are scoped to accounts, which allows wallet's owners to separate their activity easily.\nWe use a different purpose for mainly two reasons:\nIt prevents mixing up standard wallets with shared wallets, which would be undesirable and become rapidly a nightmare for software to maintain. In particular, it also makes it possible to share an intermediary account key with co-signers without disclosing any information about non-shared keys in our wallet.\nIt makes it easier to extend any of the 1852' or 1854' in a similar manner. The addition of a new role can be done in both scheme very consistently.\nUsing a different purpose also fits well the use-case on hardware wallets who can still rely on a single root seed to manage many types of wallets.\nOne or many keys can be created from a parent public key via soft-derivation. This allows participant to easily share their multisig keys to participate in a multisig script without having to fetch for their hardware device. The device is still required for signing.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "A Cardano Problem Statement (CPS) is a formalized document for the Cardano ecosystem and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed. CPSs are meant to complement CIPs and live side-by-side in the CIP repository as first-class citizens.\nNote Read this CIP's number as \"CIP minus 1\"\nA common friction point regarding complex CIPs is how their main problems are stated. For example, the 'Motivation' section in CIPs is sometimes not sufficient -- or simply underused -- to describe the various aspects of a problem, its scope, and its constraints in the necessary detail. This lack of clarity leads, in the end, to poorly defined issues and unfruitful debates amongst participants who understand problems differently.\nThe introduction of the Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs) addresses this gap by defining a formal template and structure around the description of problems. CPSs are meant to replace the more elaborate motivation of complex CIPs. However, they may also exist on their own as requests for proposals from ecosystem actors who've identified a problem but are yet to find any suitable solution.\nOver time, CPSs may complement grant systems that want to target well-known problems of the ecosystem; they can, for example, serve as the foundation for RFP (Request For Proposals) documents. We hope they may also help make some discussions more fluid by capturing a problem and its various constraints well.\nCPSs are, first and foremost, documents that capture a problem and a set of constraints and hypotheses. Documents are Markdown files with a front matter Preamble and pre-defined sections. CPS authors must abide by the general structure, though they are free to organize each section as they see fit.\nThe structure of a CPS file is summarized in the table below:\nEach CIP must begin with a YAML key:value style header preamble (also known as 'front matter data'), preceded and followed by three hyphens (---).\n---\nCPS\nTitle\nStatus\nCategory\nAuthors\nProposed Solutions\nDiscussions\nCreated\nLicense\nFor example:\n--- CPS: 1 Title: The Blockchain Trilemma Status: Open Category: Consensus Authors: - Alice <alice@domain.org> - Bob <bob@domain.org> Proposed Solutions: [] Discussions: - https://forum.cardano.org/t/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma/107720 - https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cips/pulls/9999 Created: 2009-02-14 ---\n--- CPS: 1 Title: The Blockchain Trilemma Status: Open Category: Consensus Authors: - Alice <alice@domain.org> - Bob <bob@domain.org> Proposed Solutions: [] Discussions: - https://forum.cardano.org/t/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma/107720 - https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cips/pulls/9999 Created: 2009-02-14 ---\nNote A reference template is available in .github/CPS-TEMPLATE.md\nA CPS must be stored in a specific folder named after its number and in a file called README.md.

Draft CPSs should include the status they aim for on acceptance, typically but not always; this will be 'Open'.\nAs defined in CIP-0001.\nCPSs are licensed in the public domain. More so, they must be licensed under one of the following licenses. Each new CPS must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. In addition, each license must be referenced by its respective abbreviation below in the \"Copyright\" section.\nWarning\nAll licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Cardano Problem Statement unless a later CIP extends this one to add them.\nA statement must be well-formulated (i.e. unambiguous) and demonstrate an existing problem (for which use cases exist with no suitable alternatives). When related to a current project, the problem statement must also have been acknowledged by its respective project maintainers. In some cases, problem statements may be written after the facts and be merged directly as 'Solved' should they document in more depth what motivated an existing solution.\nProblem statements deemed unclear, for which alternatives exist with no significant drawbacks or establish unrealistic goals, shall be rejected (i.e. pull request closed without merge) with justifications or withdrawn by their authors.\nSimilarly, problems that appear abandoned by their authors shall also be rejected until resurrected by their authors or another community member.\nOnce merged, authors, project maintainers, or any other ecosystem actors may propose solutions addressing the problem in the form of CIP. They add their CIP to the 'Proposed Solutions' field in the CPS' 'Preamble' once a solution has been fully implemented and reaches the goals fixed in the original statement.\nOf course, a solution may only partially address a problem. In this case, one can alter the problem statement to incorporate the partial solutions and reflect the remaining issue(s) to solve.\nAs defined in CIP-0001.\nGoals make it easier to assess whether a solution solves a problem. Goals also give a direction for projects to follow and can help navigate the design space. The section is purposely flexible -- which we may want to make more rigid in the future if it is proven hard for authors to articulate their intents. Ideally, goals capture high-level requirements.\nUse cases are essential to understanding a problem and showing that a problem addresses a need. Without use cases, there is, in fact, no problem, and merely disliking a design doesn't make it problematic. A use case is also generally user-driven, which encourages the ecosystem to open a dialogue with users to build a system that is useful to others and not only well-designed for the mere satisfaction of engineers.\nThis section is meant to save time, especially for problem statement authors who will likely be the ones who end up reviewing proposed solutions. Open questions allow authors to state upfront elements they have already thought of and that any solution should consider in its design. Moreso, it is an opportunity to mention, for example, security considerations or common pitfalls that solutions should avoid.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\nA problem may be only partially solved, in which case it remains in status 'Open'. Authors are encouraged to amend the document to explain what part of the problem remains to be solved. Consequently, CPS that are 'Solved' are considered fully addressed.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"

    "completion": "Modifying the current rewards calculation equation by substituting a n-root curved relationship between pledge and pledge benefit rewards for the current linear relationship will better achieve the original design goal of incentivizing pledge to help prevent Sybil attacks. This also reduces the unfortunate side effect in the current equation that over rewards private pools which provide no additional security benefit.\nThere are two main reasons for changing the current linear a0 pledge benefit factor in the rewards equation.\nPools pledging less than 1 million ADA see very little reward benefit. This is not a strong incentive for pool operators as at current prices that is approximately $150,000 USD.\nPrivate pools get massive reward benefit without providing any additional protection against Sybil attacks. Why should a private pool make 29 more rewards than a pool with 5m ADA pledge while doing the same work?\nThis is a modification of the maxPool function defined in section 11.8 Rewards Distribution Calculation of A Formal Specification of the Cardano Ledger .\nmaxPool = (R / (1 + a0)) * (o + (s * a0 * ((o - (s * ((z0 - o) / z0))) / z0)))\nwhere: R = ((reserve * rho) + fees) * (1 - tau) o = min(pool_stake / total_stake, z0) = z0 for fully saturated pool s = pledge / total_stake z0 = 1 / k and the following are current protocol parameters: k = 150 rho = 0.0022 a0 = 0.3 tau = .05\nThe idea is to replace s in the above equation with an n-root curve expression of pledge rather than the linear pledge value.\nWe use an expression called crossover to represent the point where the curve crosses the line and the benefit in the new and original equations is identical. Because the a0 pledge benefit is spread over the pledge range from 0 to saturation there is a dependence on k and total_stake. Since k and total_stake will likely change over time it is best to express crossover in terms of k and total_stake as follows:\ncrossover = total_stake / (k * crossover_factor)\nwhere crossover_factor is any real number greater than or equal to 1. So crossover_factor is essentially a divisor of the pool saturation amount. For example, setting crossover_factor to 20 with k = 150 and total_stake = 31 billion gives a crossover of approximately 10.3 million.\nAlso, we can parameterize the n-root curve exponent. This gives us:\ns = pow(pledge, (1 / curve_root)) * pow(crossover, ((curve_root - 1) / curve_root)) / total_stake\nThe curve_root could be set to any integer greater than 0 and when set to 1 produces the current rewards equation. The curve_root is n in n-root. For example, 1 = linear, 2 = square root, 3 = cube root, 4 = fourth root, etc.\nBy making this modification to the rewards equation we introduce two new protocol parameters, crossover_factor and curve_root, that need to be set thoughtfully.\nSee rewards.php for some simple PHP code that allows you to try different values for crossover_factor and curve_root and compare the resulting rewards to the current equation. For usage, run \"php -f rewards.php help\".\nAn interesting set of parameters as an example is:\ncurve_root = 3 crossover_factor = 8\nRunning \"php -f rewards.php 3 8\" produces:\nAssumptions Reserve: 14b Total stake: 31.7b Tx fees: 0 Fully Saturated Pool Rewards available in epoch: 29.3m Pool saturation: 211.3m\nCurve root: 3 Crossover factor: 8 Crossover: 26.4m\nPledge Rewards Benefit Alt Rwd Alt Bnft 0k 150051 0 150051 0 10k 150053 0 150458 0.27 50k 150062 0.01 150747 0.46 100k 150073 0.01 150928 0.58 200k 150094 0.03 151156 0.74 500k 150158 0.07 151551 1 1m 150264 0.14 151941 1.26 2m 150477 0.28 152432 1.59 5m 151116 0.71 153282 2.15 10m 152181 1.42 154122 2.71 20m 154311 2.84 155180 3.42 50m 160702 7.1 157012 4.64 100m 171352 14.2 158821 5.84 211.3m 195067 30 161305 7.5\nAs you can see this gives meaningful pledge benefit rewards to pools pledging less than 1m ADA.\nUsing the n-root curve pledge benefit shows a much more reasonable distribution of pledge related rewards which will encourage meaningful pledges from more pool operators thus making the network more secure against Sybil attacks. It also provides higher rewards for higher pledge without disproportionately rewarding a very few private pool operators who provide no additional security value to the network. This modification maintains the general principles of the current rewards equation and does not introduce any hard limits. It improves the incentives that were originally designed to make them more meaningful for the majority of pool operators.\nThis proposal is backwards compatible with the current reward function by setting the curve_root parameter to 1.\nAgreement by the Ledger team as defined in CIP-0084 under Expectations for ledger CIPs including \"expert opinion\" on changes to rewards & incentives.\nAuthor has offered to produce an implementation of this change as a pull request if shown where the current maxPool reward equation is implemented in the code.\n2020 Shawn McMurdo.

This specification defines the manner that such code is to be accessed by the webpage/dApp, as well as defining the API for dApps to communicate with the user's wallet. This document currently concerns the Shelley-Mary era but will have a second version once Plutus is supported. This specification is intended to cover similar use cases as web3 for Ethereum or EIP-0012 for Ergo. The design of this spec was based on the latter.\nIn order to facilitate future dApp development, we will need a way for dApps to communicate with the user's wallet. While Cardano does not yet support smart contracts, there are still various use cases for this, such as NFT management. This will also lay the groundwork for an updated version of the spec once the Alonzo hardfork is released which can extend it to allow for Plutus support.\nA string representing an address in either bech32 format, or hex-encoded bytes.

A shared, namespaced cardano object must be injected into the page if it did not exist already. Each wallet implementing this standard must then create a field in this object with a name unique to each wallet containing a wallet object with the following methods. The API is split into two stages to maintain the user's privacy, as the user will have to consent to cardano.{walletName}.enable() in order for the dApp to read any information pertaining to the user's wallet with {walletName} corresponding to the wallet's namespaced name of its choice.\ncardano\nwallet\ncardano.{walletName}.enable()\n{walletName}\ncardano.{walletName}.enable({ extensions: Extension[] } = {}): Promise<API>\nErrors: APIError\nAPIError\nThis is the entrypoint to start communication with the user's wallet. The wallet should request the user's permission to connect the web page to the user's wallet, and if permission has been granted, the full API will be returned to the dApp to use. The wallet can choose to maintain a whitelist to not necessarily ask the user's permission every time access is requested, but this behavior is up to the wallet and should be transparent to web pages using this API. If a wallet is already connected this function should not request access a second time, and instead just return the API object.\nAPI\nUpon start, dApp can explicitly request a list of additional functionalities they expect as a list of CIP numbers capturing those extensions. This is used as an extensibility mechanism to document what functionalities can be provided by the wallet interface. CIP-0030 provides a set of base interfaces that every wallet must support. Then, new functionalities are introduced via additional CIPs and may be all or partially supported by wallets.\nDApps are expected to use this endpoint to perform an initial handshake and ensure that the wallet supports all their required functionalities. Note that it's possible for two extensions to be mutually incompatible (because they provide two conflicting features). While we may try to avoid this as much as possible while designing CIPs, it is also the responsability of wallet providers to assess whether they can support a given combination of extensions, or not. Hence wallets aren't expected to fail should they not recognize or not support a particular combination of extensions. Instead, they should decide what they enable and reflect their choice in the response to api.getExtensions() in the Full API. As a result, dApps may fail and inform their users or may use a different, less-efficient, strategy to cope with a lack of functionality.\napi.getExtensions()\nIt is at the extension author's discretion if they wish to separate their endpoints from the base API via namespacing. Although, it is highly recommend that authors do namespace all of their extensions. If namespaced, endpoints must be preceded by .cipXXXX. from the API object, without any leading zeros.\n.cipXXXX.\nAPI\nFor example; CIP-0123's endpoints should be accessed by:\napi.cip123.endpoint1() api.cip123.endpoint2()\napi.cip123.endpoint1() api.cip123.endpoint2()\nAuthors should be careful when omitting namespacing. Omission should only be considered when creating endpoints to override those defined in this specification or other extensions. Even so when overriding; the new functionality should not prevent dApps from accessing past functionality thus overriding must ensure backwards compatibility.\nAny namespace omission needs to be fully justified via the proposal's Rationale section, with explanation to why it is necessary. Any potential backwards compatibility considerations should be noted to give wallets and dApps a clear unambiguous direction.\nExtensions that are draft, in development, or prototyped should not use extension naming nor should they use official namspacing until assigned a CIP number. Draft extension authors are free to test their implementation endpoints by using the Experimental API. Once a CIP number is assigned implementors should move functionality out of the experimental API.\nYes. Extensions may have other extensions as pre-requisite. Some newer extensions may also invalidate functionality introduced by earlier extensions. There's no particular rule or constraints in that regards. Extensions are specified as CIP, and will define what it entails to enable them.\nYes. They all are CIPs.\nYes. Extensions may introduce new endpoints or error codes, and modify existing ones. Although, it is recommended that endpoints are namespaced. Extensions may even change the rules outlined in this very proposal. The idea being that wallet providers should start off implementing this CIP, and then walk their way to implementing their chosen extensions.\nNo. It's up to wallet providers to decide which extensions they ought to support.\ncardano.{walletName}.isEnabled(): Promise<bool>\nErrors: APIError\nAPIError\nReturns true if the dApp is already connected to the user's wallet, or if requesting access would return true without user confirmation (e.g. the dApp is whitelisted), and false otherwise.

With a single required parameter for now: amount. (NOTE: some wallets may be ignoring the amount parameter, in which case it might be possible to call the function without it, but this behavior is not recommended!). Reasons why the amount parameter is required:\namount\namount\nSo requiring the amount parameter would be a by-spec behavior for a wallet. Not requiring it is possible, but not specified, so dapps should not rely on that and the behavior is not recommended.\namount\nThis shall return a list of one or more UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) controlled by the wallet that are required to reach AT LEAST the combined ADA value target specified in amount AND the best suitable to be used as collateral inputs for transactions with plutus script inputs (pure ADA-only utxos). If this cannot be attained, an error message with an explanation of the blocking problem shall be returned. NOTE: wallets are free to return utxos that add up to a greater total ADA value than requested in the amount parameter, but wallets must never return any result where utxos would sum up to a smaller total ADA value, instead in a case like that an error message must be returned.\namount\namount\nThe main point is to allow the wallet to encapsulate all the logic required to handle, maintain, and create (possibly on-demand) the UTXOs suitable for collateral inputs. For example, whenever attempting to create a plutus-input transaction the dapp might encounter a case when the set of all user UTXOs don't have any pure entries at all, which are required for the collateral, in which case the dapp itself is forced to try and handle the creation of the suitable entries by itself. If a wallet implements this function it allows the dapp to not care whether the suitable utxos exist among all utxos, or whether they have been stored in a separate address chain (see https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/104), or whether they have to be created at the moment on-demand - the wallet guarantees that the dapp will receive enough utxos to cover the requested amount, or get an error in case it is technically impossible to get collateral in the wallet (e.g. user does not have enough ADA at all).\nThe amount parameter is required, specified as a string (BigNumber) or a number, and the maximum allowed value must be agreed to be something like 5 ADA. Not limiting the maximum possible value might force the wallet to attempt to purify an unreasonable amount of ADA just because the dapp is doing something weird. Since by protocol the required collateral amount is always a percentage of the transaction fee, it seems that the 5 ADA limit should be enough for the foreseeable future.\namount\nstring\nnumber\napi.getBalance(): Promise<cbor<value>>\nErrors: APIError\nAPIError\nReturns the total balance available of the wallet.

In some cases the order is highly significant, e.g. earlier orders should be processed first, and the outcome of processing an earlier order may affect later ones.\nFor example, we might have:\ninputIdxs :: BuiltinList Integer outputIdxs :: BuiltinList Integer\ninputIdxs :: BuiltinList Integer outputIdxs :: BuiltinList Integer\nWe then want to go through these lists, looking up the corresponding inputs and outputs and check some property (e.g. that the value is directly transferred from one to the other).\nThis requires a quadratic amount of work, which puts a low ceiling on how many orders can be processed at once. Empirically, many are capped at about 30, whereas if they were limited only by the amount of space in the transaction for inputs and outputs the limit would be hundreds.\nIf we had arrays with constant time indexing, we could make this linear instead. Note that unless we also implemented the \"Data fields\" suggestion below we would still need to do a linear amount of work to create arrays for the transaction inputs and outputs from the lists in the script context.\nThe Data type has a Constr alternative which is used for encoding datatype constructors. This is used for encoding the script context, and is used by languages such as Aiken extensively for representing user-defined datatypes also.\nData\nConstr\nThe fields of the constructor are encoded in a list; hence to access a particular field the compiled code needs to do a linear amount of work.

CIPs authors must abide by the general structure, though they are free to organise each section as they see fit.\nThe structure of a CIP file is summarised in the table below:\nMotivation\nN/A\nNote Each of these section titles (Abstract onward) should be an H2 heading (beginning with markdown ##). Subsections like Versioning or Acceptance Criteria should be H3 headings (e.g. ### Versioning). Don't include a H1 title heading (markdown #): for web friendly contexts, this will be generated from the Preamble.\n##\n### Versioning\n#\nEach CIP must begin with a YAML key:value style header preamble (also known as front matter data), preceded and followed by three hyphens (---).\n---\nCIP\nTitle\n-\nStatus\nCategory\nAuthors\nImplementors\nN/A\n[]\nDiscussions\nSolution-To\nCreated\nLicense\nFor example:\n--- CIP: 1 Title: CIP Process Status: Active Category: Meta Authors: - Frederic Johnson <frederic.johnson@cardanofoundation.org> - Sebastien Guillemot <sebastien@dcspark.io> - Matthias Benkort <matthias.benkort@cardanofoundation.org> - Duncan Coutts <duncan.coutts@iohk.io> Implementors: N/A Discussions: - https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/366 Created: 2020-03-21 License: CC-BY-4.0 ---\n--- CIP: 1 Title: CIP Process Status: Active Category: Meta Authors: - Frederic Johnson <frederic.johnson@cardanofoundation.org> - Sebastien Guillemot <sebastien@dcspark.io> - Matthias Benkort <matthias.benkort@cardanofoundation.org> - Duncan Coutts <duncan.coutts@iohk.io> Implementors: N/A Discussions: - https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/366 Created: 2020-03-21 License: CC-BY-4.0 ---\nEspecially because Markdown link syntax is not supported in the header preamble, labels can be added to clarify list items; e.g.:\nDiscussions: - Original-PR: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/366\nDiscussions: - Original-PR: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/366\nNote A reference template is available in .github/CIP-TEMPLATE.md\nA CIP must be stored in a specific folder named after its number (4-digit, left-padded with 0) and in a file called README.md. Before a number is assigned, a placeholder folder name should be used (e.g. CIP-my-new-feature). After a number has been assigned, rename the folder.\n0\nREADME.md\nCIP-my-new-feature\nAdditional supporting files (such as diagrams, binary specifications, dialect grammars, JSON schemas etc.) may be added to the CIP's folder under freely chosen names.\nFor example:\nCIP-0010 ├── README.md ├── registry.json └── registry.schema.json\nCIP-0010 ├── README.md ├── registry.json └── registry.schema.json\nWhile CIPs are mainly technical documents meant to be read primarily by developers -- and thus often written in English; some may be translated into various languages to increase their outreach. Any file in a CIP folder may also include translated content satisfying the following rules:\nAny translated file shall share a common basename with its original source.\nTranslation file basenames must have a suffix using an ISO 639-1 language code, separated by a dot . character. (e.g. README.fr.md).\n.\nREADME.fr.md\nWhen no language code is provided as suffix, the default language for the document is assumed to be English (UK/US).\nTranslated CIPs (i.e. README files), must not include the original preamble. They must, however, include the following preamble as yaml frontmatter data:\nREADME\nCIP\nSource\nTitle\nRevision\n12ab34c\nTranslators\nJohn Doe <john.doe@email.domain>\nLanguage\nfr\nCIPs must indicate how the defined Specification is versioned. Note this does not apply to the CIP text, for which annotated change logs are automatically generated and available through the GitHub UI as a history of CIP files and directories.\nAuthors are free to describe any approach to versioning that allows versioned alterations to be added without author oversight. Stipulating that the proposal must be superseded by another is also considered to be valid versioning.\nA single Versioning scheme can be placed either as a subsection of the Specification section or in an optional Versioning top-level section near the end. If the Specification contains multiple specification subsections, each of these can have a Versioning subsection within it.\nCIPs are licensed in the public domain. More so, they must be licensed under one of the following licenses. Each new CIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. In addition, each license must be referenced by its respective abbreviation below in the \"Copyright\" section.\nWarning\nAll licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Cardano Improvement Proposal unless a later CIP extends this one to add them.\nCIPs can have three statuses: Proposed, Active or Inactive. The CIP Process section highlights how CIPs move through these statuses; no CIP should be given one of these statuses without satisfying the criteria described here below.\nProposed\nActive\nInactive\nNote There is no \"draft\" status: a proposal which has not been merged (and hence exists in a PR) is a draft CIP. Draft CIPs should include the status they are aiming for on acceptance. Typically, but not always, this will be 'Proposed'.\nA 'Proposed' CIP is any CIP that meets the essential CIP criteria but is not yet 'Active'. The criteria that must meet a CIP to be merged as 'Proposed' are:\nAn 'Active' CIP has taken effect according to the criteria defined in its 'Path to Active' section. Said differently, each CIP defines by which criteria it can become 'Active' and those criteria are included in the review process. Exact criteria thereby depends on the nature of the CIP, typically:\nActive\nA proposal that is 'Active' is considered complete and is synonymous with \"production readiness\" when it comes to the maturity of a solution. 'Active' CIPs will not be updated substantially (apart from minor edits, proofreading and added precisions). They can, nevertheless, be challenged through new proposals if need be.\nAn 'Inactive' CIP describes any proposal that does not fit into the other types. A CIP can therefore be 'Inactive' for various reasons (e.g. obsolete, superseded, abandoned). Hence the status must indicate a justification between parentheses; for example:\nStatus: Inactive (superseded by CIP-0001)\nStatus: Inactive (superseded by CIP-0001)\nThis must be subdivided into two sub-sections:\n'Acceptance Criteria'\nThis sub-section must define a list of criteria by which the proposal can become active. Criteria must relate to observable metrics or deliverables and be reviewed by editors and project maintainers when applicable. For example: \"The changes to the ledger rules are implemented and deployed on Cardano mainnet by a majority of the network\", or \"The following key projects have implemented support for this standard\".\n'Implementation Plan'\nThis sub-section should define the plan by which a proposal will meet its acceptance criteria, when applicable. More, proposals that require implementation work in a specific project may indicate one or more implementors. Implementors must sign off on the plan and be referenced in the document's preamble.\nIn particular, an implementation that requires a hard-fork should explicitly mention it in its 'Implementation Plan'.\nNote the statuses of Proposed and Active both require a Path to Active section, making this a required section for all viable proposals. Even if a CIP is edited or submitted with an Inactive status, it may still be helpful to have a Path to Active if there are conditions that might lead to its acceptance or implementation.\nProposed\nActive\nInactive\nPath to Active\nCIPs are classified into distinct categories that help organise (and thus, find) them. Categories are meant to be flexible and evolve as new domains emerge. Authors may leave the category as ? should they not be sure under which category their proposal falls; editors will eventually assign one or reject the proposal altogether should it relate to an area where the CIP process does not apply.\n?\nSubmissions can be made to these categories whenever relevant, without following any particular submission guidelines:\nAdditionally, representatives of ecosystem categories may explicitly enlist their categories (see next section) to suggest a closer relationship with the CIP process. The following categories are confirmed as enlisted according to CIPs which define that relationship:\nThese tentatively enlisted categories await CIPs to describe any enlistment relationship:\nProject representatives intending to follow an \"enlisted\" category above agree to coordinate with related development by sharing efforts to review and validate new proposals. It should be noted that single organisations can no longer represent any ecosystem or development category, which makes these enlistment guidelines both decentralised and cooperative, including whenever possible:\nAny guidelines for this cooperation should be described by a dedicated CIP whenever possible. When such a CIP is posted or supersedes another one, it will be entered into the above table in the Categories section. Participants of enlisted categories should follow the requirements outlined in that CIP and should update such proposals whenever these requirements or relationships change.\nWarning A positive review by any enlisted project representative does not constitute a commitment to implement the CIP. It is still the CIP author's responsibility to create an implementation plan and identify implementors.\nEditors occasionally invite representatives from enlisted categories to speak during review meetings and solicit them for ultimate approvals of proposals in their area of expertise.\nNote Optionally, projects may show their enlisting using the following badge on their introductory README:\n![https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/master/.github/badge.svg)\n![https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/master/.github/badge.svg)\nProposals must be submitted to the cardano-foundation/CIPs repository as a pull request named after the proposal's title. The pull request title should not include a CIP number (and use ? instead as number); the editors will assign one. Discussions may precede a proposal. Early reviews and discussions streamline the process down the line.\n?\nNote Pull requests should not include implementation code: any code bases should instead be provided as links to a code repository.\nNote Proposals addressing a specific CPS should also be listed in the corresponding CPS header, in 'Proposed Solutions', to keep track of ongoing work.\nWhen a CIP title and subject matter share a common element, begin the CIP title with that common element and end it with the specific portion, delimited with the - character. Example (CIP-0095):\n-\nWeb-Wallet Bridge - Governance\nCIP editors will help determine these common elements and, whenever necessary, rename both CIP document titles and PR titles accordingly. The objective is to provide commonly recognisable names for similar developments (e.g. multiple extensions to another CIP or scheme).\nIn the original comment for your pull request, please include a link to the directory or the README.md for the CIP in your working branch, so readers and reviewers can easily follow your work. This makes it easier for editors and the community to read and review your proposal.\nREADME.md\nNote If this link changes (e.g. from the CIP directory being renamed), please keep this link updated.\nAuthors shall champion their proposals. The CIP process is a collaborative effort, which implies discussions between different groups of individuals. While editors may provide specific inputs and help reach out to experts, authors shall actively seek feedback from the community to help move their proposal forward.\nDiscussions and comments shall mainly happen on Github in pull requests. When discussed on other mediums, we expect authors or participants to report back a summary of their discussions to the original pull request to keep track of the most critical conversations in a written form and all in one place.\nAs much as possible, commenters/reviewers shall remain unbiased in their judgement and assess proposals in good faith. Authors have the right to reject comments or feedback but are strongly encouraged to address concerns in their 'Rationale' section. Ultimately, CIP editors shall make the last call concerning the various statements made on a proposal and their treatment by the author(s).\nBy opening pull requests or posting comments, commenters and authors agree to our Code of Conduct. Any comment infringing this code of conduct shall be removed or altered without prior notice.\nNote For acceptability guidelines, including a concise review checklist, see CIP Wiki CIPs for Reviewers & Authors.\nCIP editors meet regularly in a public Discord server to go through newly proposed ideas in a triage phase. As a result of a triage, editors acknowledge new CIPs, and briefly review their preamble. Editors also assign numbers to newly proposed CIPs during this phase. Incidentally, the triage allows new CIPs to get visibility for potential reviews.\nIn every meeting, editors will also review in more depth some chosen CIPs (based on their readiness and the stability of the discussions) and assess if they meet the criteria to be merged in their aimed status.\nDuring review sessions, editors will regularly invite project maintainers or actors from the ecosystem who are deemed relevant to the meeting's agenda. However, meetings are open and held in public to encourage anyone interested in participating.\nA dedicated Discord channel may also be created for some long-running discussions to support quick chats and progress on particular topics (while still being regularly summarised on the repository).\nOnce a proposal has reached all requirements for its target status (as explained in Statuses) and has been sufficiently and faithfully discussed by community members, it is merged with its target status.\nWarning Ideas deemed unsound shall be rejected with justifications or withdrawn by the authors. Similarly, proposals that appear abandoned by their authors shall be rejected until resurrected by their authors or another community member.\nCIPs are generally merged with the status 'Proposed' until they meet their 'Path to Active' requirements. In some rare cases (mainly when written after the facts and resulting in a broad consensus), proposals may be merged as 'Active' immediately.\nEach proposal is unique and has a bespoke 'Path to Active', which must be reviewed case-by-case. There must be sufficient time between the first appearance of a proposal and its merge into the repository to ensure enough opportunity for community members to review it.\nOnce merged, implementors shall execute the CIP's 'Implementation Plan', if any. If a proposal has no implementors or no 'Implementation Plan', it may simply remain as 'Proposed' in the repository.\nWarning It is perfectly fine to submit ideas in the repository with no concrete implementation plan, yet they should be treated as such: ideas.\nBesides, once all of the 'Path to Active' requirements have been met, authors shall make another pull request to change their CIP's status to 'Active'. Editors may also do this on occasion.\nFor a full, current description of Editor workflow, see CIP Wiki CIPs for Editors.\nCIP Editors safeguard the CIP process: they form a group enforcing the process described in this document and facilitating conversations between community actors. CIP editors should strive to keep up to date with general technical discussions and Cardano proposals. For each new draft proposal submitted on cardano-foundation/CIPs an editor might review it as follows:\nCIPs that do not meet a sufficient level of quality or don't abide by the process described in this document will be rejected until their authors address review comments.\nNote that editors may provide technical feedback on proposals in some cases, although they aren't expected to be the sole technical reviewers of proposals. CIPs are, before anything, a community-driven effort. While editors are here to facilitate the discussion and mediate debates, they aren't necessarily technical experts on all subjects covered by CIPs.\nTherefore, CIPs authors are encouraged to reach out to known experts to demonstrate their good faith and openness when they champion a proposal. Editors may help with such efforts but cannot be expected to do this alone.\nExisting editors or the community may nominate new editors, provided they have proven to be already existing and active contributors to the CIP process and are ready to commit some of their time to the CIP process regularly.\nThe missions of an editor include, but aren't exclusively limited to, any of the tasks listed above. Active members that seek to become listed editors may also come forth and let it be known. Any application will take the form of a pull request updating this document with a justification as the pull request's description.\nCurrent editors are listed here below:\nEmeritus editors:\nA significant friction point regarding complex CIPs is often how the main problem is stated. The 'Motivation' is often insufficient (or simply underused) to describe various aspects of a problem, its scope, and its constraints. This lack of clarity leads, in the end, to poorly defined issues and debates over solutions that feel unclear amongst different participants.\nThe introduction of CIP-9999: Cardano Problem Statements addresses this gap by introducing a formal template and structure around problem statements. However, requiring any CIP to be preceded by a CPS would likely be overkill and become an obstacle to the overall adoption of the CIP process for more straightforward problems. At this stage, it is reasonable to think either (a) that CIP authors would foresee the complexity and state their problem as a CPS beforehand or (b) that editors or reviewers will require authors to write a CPS to clarify a perhaps ambiguous motivation on complex CIPs.\nWe also anticipate project maintainers or community actors will write standalone CPS to document well-known issues for which the design space is still to be explored.\nA recurring pain point with the previous CIP process was the lack of clear ownership/accountability of some proposals affecting remote parts of the ecosystem. On several occasions, proposals from community members have concerned, for example, core components of the Cardano architecture. However, those proposals have been hard to move forward with and to either reject or turn into concrete action steps. Authors usually do not have the technical proficiency required to implement them and rely on the core engineering team in charge of projects to do so. Thus, explicit compliance and collaboration of those engineering teams are necessary to propose changes affecting their work.\nBy asking teams to explicitly state their compliance with the CIP process with clear, accountable owners (as individuals), it becomes plausible to now establish a dialogue between community members and technical leadership responsible for specific ecosystem projects. Furthermore, projects that, on the contrary, do not seek to participate in CIP or receive contributions in the form of CIP/CPS are automatically taken out of this process, saving time and energy for both reviewers and authors.\nThe 'Editors' section now details how to become a CIP editor. The process aims to be simple and define those involved the most with editorship tasks as editors. Thus, being an active contributor to the CIP process as a prerequisite only makes sense. We want to leave the room open for either existing editors to refer an existing community as an editor or for community members to formulate that request explicitly.\nThere are no delays or number of contributions necessary to pretend to become an editor. Those criteria are often less relevant than others and more subjective, such as the quality of one's participation or their relevance. Since editors also need to work with one another in the end, it seems logical that existing editors have their final say about whom they intend to work with.\ntype\nThe type field in the header has shown to be:\ntype\ntype\nAn ad-hoc classification by non-rigid categories, which may evolve over time to reflect ecosystem areas, seems better suited. Therefore, we do not require authors to categorise their CIPs; instead, categories will be added and maintained by editors as a side task atop the CIP process.\nOver time we've learnt that the valuable information a status should convey is really about the readiness of a CIP, especially regarding standards. For a long time, many CIPs have lived as Draft despite some being used in dozens of systems. Consequently, the status has lost a bit of its meaning. The frontier between Draft and Proposed hasn't always been clear, and it has proven challenging to come up with good statuses to describe all possible rejections. So instead, the current division of statuses is as simple-as-it-can-be and remains flexible regarding rejections.\nDraft\nstatus\nDraft\nProposed\nThe choice of a code of conduct follows other popular open source initiatives. It serves as a good, unilaterally accepted foundation which can be later revisited if necessary.\nThe proposal has been reviewed by the community and sufficiently advertised on various channels.\nAll major concerns or feedback have been addressed. The document is as unambiguous as it can be and it outlines a process that a supermajority of reviewers is happy to follow.\nThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.\n2023 Cardano Foundation"
