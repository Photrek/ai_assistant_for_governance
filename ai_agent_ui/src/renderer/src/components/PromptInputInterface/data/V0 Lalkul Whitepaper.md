# 1\. Introduction and Purpose

The Lalkul DRep initiative was established to address key challenges within Cardano’s governance model as it transitions into the Voltaire phase. Under the CIP-1694 governance framework, Delegated Representatives (DReps) play a critical role in decision-making on behalf of the Cardano community. Cardano has introduced three key governance pillars to support its decentralized ecosystem:

* **Intersect**, a member-based organization tasked with overseeing Cardano's code development.   
* **On-chain governance**, which involves decision-making by **Delegated Representatives (dReps)**, **Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)**, and a **Constitutional Committee (CC)**.   
* **The Constitution**, with its final version ratified during a workshop in Argentina in December, 2024\. 

As part of the transition to on-chain governance, CIP-1694 introduces DReps, individuals tasked with representing the interests of ADA holders, to vote on governance proposals. Voting power will be given based on ADA delegated to a DRep. Informally, DRep responsibilities include: 

* Evaluating proposals related to protocol upgrades, staking, infrastructure improvements, and other governance actions.  
* Making informed decisions on behalf of ADA holders, who delegate their voting power to them.  
* Engaging with the community to understand its priorities and concerns.

While the introduction of DReps is a significant step toward decentralization, it also presents challenges:

* Broad skill requirements: The complex and technical nature of many governance proposals requires expertise in multiple domains, which is difficult for a single DRep to possess.  
* Lack of a structured framework: Current DRep systems lack a comprehensive structure that ensures effective decision-making, accountability, and community engagement.

The Lalkul DRep initiative provides a solution by introducing a team-managed DRep approach grounded in Sociocratic Pluralism and the principles of sociocracy. This model leverages the expertise of multiple community members through a structured, circle-based governance system where each subcircle focuses on specific areas of Cardano governance.

The key benefits of this approach are:

* **Specialized Expertise:** Each subcircle can focus on a specific domain (e.g., Infrastructure, Applications, Open topics), ensuring decisions are made by those with relevant knowledge.  
* **Inclusive Decision-Making:** Using a consent-based model, the team can incorporate multiple perspectives and ensure that decisions are not dominated by a single individual.  
* **Clear Accountability:** The circle structure promotes transparency, as all decision-making processes are documented and shared with the community.

The Lalkul DRep initiative hinges on a clear and compelling Vision, Mission, and Aim. These are essential to define, as they guide decision-making. 

* Vision: Lalkul seeks to illuminate an enlightened pathway for decentralized governance.  
* Mission: To create and adopt a framework for a collective Cardano DRep committed to improving decentralized governance.  
* Aim: Develop and model exceptional Delegated Representation by building an inclusive and resilient community, utilizing prosocial principles of democracy, pluralism, and sociocracy.

# 2\. The LALKUL Organizational Structure

The LALKUL DRep model is designed to ensure inclusive, transparent, and consent-based decision-making. This model incorporates a circle structure, with each circle focusing on specific areas of expertise, ensuring that relevant voices are heard and governance decisions are made efficiently.

## 2.1 Sociocratic Principles

The Lalkul DRep governance structure is rooted in sociocracy, a governance method based on equality and the continuous improvement of decision-making. Key principles include:

* **Peer-to-Peer Circles:** Decisions are made within circles, which represent teams of people with specific expertise. Each circle has autonomy over its domain but is interlinked with other circles.  
* **Consent-Based Decision-Making:** Decisions are made when no one has reasoned objections. This approach ensures decisions are not blocked by minor disagreements but are "good enough for now and safe to try."  
* **Feedback Loops:** Continuous feedback is collected to evaluate decisions, ensuring they evolve over time and are refined based on community input.  
* **Role Rotation:** Leadership roles within each circle are rotated periodically, ensuring that no individual dominates decision-making and fresh perspectives are brought into leadership positions.

## 2.2 LALKUL Circle Structure

The Lalkul DRep model is organized into a **coordinating circle** (Lalkul DRep) and several **subcircles**, each focusing on a different area of expertise. Each circle operates with autonomy while remaining connected to the larger structure, ensuring coordination and communication between circles. Figure 1 shows the initial circle structure of LALKUL.

### 2.2.1 Coordinating Circle: Lalkul DRep

The **coordinating circle** serves as the central authority for the Lalkul DRep initiative. It is responsible for coordinating the activities of subcircles, overseeing key governance decisions, and ensuring alignment with the overall vision and mission of the Lalkul DRep.

**Responsibilities**:

* **Final decision-making accountability** on governance proposals.  
* **Coordination of subcircles**, ensuring that each circle is functioning effectively and is aligned with Lalkul’s goals. A leader and delegate from   
* **Engagement with the broader Cardano community**, gathering feedback and ensuring transparency in governance.

**Key Roles**:

* **Leader**: Guides the strategic direction of Lalkul DRep and ensures that subcircles align with the overall mission.  
* **Facilitator**: Oversees meetings and ensures smooth discussions, helping guide the consent-based decision-making process.  
* **Secretary**: Keeps detailed meeting minutes, documents decisions, and ensures all records are transparent and accessible to the community.  
* **Delegate(s)**: Represent the subcircles in the parent circle, ensuring that communication flows between the circles and bringing important proposals back to the parent circle for final decisions.

### 2.2.2 Role Definitions

The governance structure relies on clearly defined roles to ensure smooth operations and accountability. Each circle will :

* **Leader**: Sets the strategic direction for the circle and ensures alignment with the mission and objectives.  
* **Facilitator**: Guides discussions, ensures meetings run smoothly, and helps the circle reach consent.  
* **Secretary**: Documents meetings, tracks action items, and ensures transparency by maintaining records.  
* **Delegate**: Represents the subcircle in the parent circle and serves as a communication bridge between circles.  
* **Member:** Not all members will have one of the above roles. If there are enough members in a circle, some members will just be members. All members’ consent is needed to pass a decision within that circle.

**Role Rotation**:

* All roles within the circle are rotated periodically to prevent stagnation and encourage leadership development. The rotation time frame can be decided by each sub circle but is recommended to start with no more than 1 year terms for this first iteration.

### 2.2.3 Domain Circles

Each domain circle is responsible for handling governance decisions related to specific domains of expertise. By focusing on different aspects of Cardano’s ecosystem, each subcircle can apply specialized knowledge to governance proposals. As we are still growing we found it beneficial to combine the 4 traditional sociocratic circle roles as outlined in section 2.2.2 into the two essential roles for the sub circles. 

* Facilitator and Leader   
* Secretary and Delegate

The sub circle will be in charge of recommending a vote with justification to the parent circle.

**Initial Subcircles**:

* **Infrastructure Circle**  
  * **Focus**: Governance decisions related to Cardano’s infrastructure, such as protocol upgrades, staking mechanisms, and network improvements.  
  * **Target Members**: Blockchain developers, protocol experts, infrastructure-focused SPOs.  
* **Applications Circle**  
  * **Focus**: Decisions related to decentralized applications (DApps), DeFi protocols, and other Cardano-based solutions.  
  * **Target Members**: Entrepreneurs, DApp developers, product managers, and DeFi experts.  
* **Open Circle**  
  * **Focus**: Any governance actions that do not fit into the other subcircles or exploratory governance topics. This circle is also in charge of onboarding new members and creating other domain circles.  
  * **Target Members**: Cardano community members, technical and non-technical participants, those interested in governance processes.   
* **Policy Circle (non-voting)**  
  * **Focus:** To provide the DREP with policies and advice on structure, decision making processes, voting mechanisms, etc.  
  * **Members**: Advisors, Industry leaders, Constitutional Committee members, SPOs

**Subcircle Autonomy**:

* Each subcircle has the authority to make decisions within its domain but must ensure that major decisions align with the broader objectives of Lalkul DRep.  
* Sub Circles meet weekly or bi-weekly, depending on their activity level, and submit reports to the parent circle. The leader and representative are responsible for updating the parent circle on key decisions and progress

To foster collaboration and communication there are regular  calls (biweekly as a default for the early phase, although could be more or less frequent as needed)for the greater DRep circles. These calls include:

* **Breakout sessions** for each domain circle to discuss their processes, propose improvements, and align on their ongoing responsibilities.  
* Opportunities to share updates and insights across circles to improve governance coordination and accountability.

# 3\. Decision-Making Processes

Our governance framework is designed to ensure transparency, trust, and efficiency through clearly defined processes and roles. Decision-making leverages **Sociocratic methods**, including **consent-based decision-making**, **feedback loops**, and **delegation** to specific domain circles. This section outlines the step-by-step process, the roles of domain and parent circles, and how disagreements and exceptions are handled.

### 3.1 Decision-Making Process Overview

#### 3.1.1 Assignment to Domain Circles

#### Governance actions are assigned to specific domain circles based on their relevance and scope.

* #### Assignments must be made at least **X amount of time** before votes are due to allow adequate time for deliberation and review.

* #### If no clear domain circle is applicable, proposals are temporarily assigned to the most relevant circle or distributed randomly in the first iteration.

* If a governance action requires **multi-disciplinary input**, the assigned domain circles join to form a **greater circle** for collaborative review. 

#### This assignment process ensures that proposals are reviewed by the most relevant stakeholders and, when necessary, coordinated across multiple domains.

#### 3.1.2 Decision-making within Domain Circles 

Once a governance action is assigned, the respective **domain circle** has the autonomy to determine how best to collaborate and finalize decisions. Circles may hold formal meetings or conduct asynchronous discussions in dedicated channels. Regardless of the format, the following steps are followed to ensure a structured and transparent decision-making process:

1. **Proposal Review:**  
   Members analyze the proposal’s relevance, impact, and alignment with governance principles.  
2. **Discussion and Feedback:**  
   Members discuss the proposal in rounds, share perspectives, and address objections or concerns collaboratively.  
3. **Consent-Based Approval:**  
   Decisions are reached using **consent-based decision-making** unless substantial objections arise. Any objections must be resolved before finalizing.  
4. **Justification:**  
   Approved decisions include a written justification to ensure transparency and provide context for the broader community.  
5. **Escalation:**  
   Proposals with unresolved objections or requiring broader input are escalated to the **coordinating circle**.

#### 3.1.3 Coordinating Circle Voting Process

Once approved, the **coordinating circle** casts the official vote:

1. **Voting Process:**  
   * The **Lalkul DRep** casts the vote.  
   * In **Phase 1**, the domain circle leader (or another member if the leader is unavailable) joins the voting member online (either as a live call or via messaging) to review and align before casting the vote via governance tools (**govtools**).  
2. **Transparency:**  
   * After voting, the **Lalkul DRep** publishes a report detailing the proposal, rationale, and voting outcome on governance tools and social channels.

#### 3.1.4 Emergency Decision Handling

#### If urgent decisions arise:

1. #### **Emergency Meeting:**

   * #### The **coordinating circle** holds a meeting with at least one member of the relevant domain circle present.

2. #### **No Representation, No Vote:**

   * #### If no meeting or representation occurs in time, **no vote is cast**, prioritizing integrity over expediency.

#### This ensures compliance with policy and fair representation, even under tight deadlines.

# 4\. Onboarding and Mentorship

The success of the **Lalkul DRep initiative** is built on the active participation and collaboration of its community members. Each member contributes their expertise, perspectives, and dedication to foster informed and diverse governance decisions. Membership in Lalkul is open to all Cardano community members who are committed to participating in discussions, providing insights, and supporting governance actions.

#### 4.1 Onboarding Process

The onboarding process ensures that new members understand their roles and are fully equipped to contribute to Lalkul’s governance framework.

1. **Guest Participation:**  
   * New members begin as **guests**, observing discussions and subcircle meetings.  
   * Guests do not have voting power but are encouraged to contribute to conversations and learn governance processes.  
2. **Becoming a Full Member:**  
   * Guests may apply for full membership after meeting the following requirements:
