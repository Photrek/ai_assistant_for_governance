As we put these practices into action, we saw a dramatic shift our meetings became more inclusive and productive, and the overall team dynamic improved. Most notably, sociocracy brought a sense of mental calm, reducing stress and fostering a more collaborative work environment.\" Megan Hess, People and Profits.\nSociocracy taught me to be patient as I listened to everyone on the team. In the past, upon hearing input I would quickly respond with my own thoughts not realizing the value of waiting till others responded first. Kenric Nelson, President\nWorking at Photrek using Sociocracy is a gift. The initial check-in round, when everyone tells how they feel, is often a moment that relieves stress, we laugh, and we calm our minds, connect with each other, and feel the humanity behind everyone. When we do rounds in the meeting about important issues, I learn a lot by hearing different perspectives and how to participate, provide feedback and share my thoughts with the group in a safe environment. I feel this helps everyone to be heard and to consider every single voice as important in our decisions. Igor Oliveira, Algorithm Developer and Researcher.\nAs a woman in a male-dominated industry and communities, it s often challenging to speak up and contribute. Sociocracy provided me with a space where my voice was valued, empowering me to take on different roles that strengthened my skills and confidence. It allowed me to feel equal and heard. Through these processes, I also learned patience, understanding that our initial reactions are often impulsive and that true growth comes from actively listening to different perspectives. By doing so, I realized that my own views could evolve, leading to deeper understanding and better decision-making.\" Juana Attieh, Product Impact Lead & SingularityNET Circle\nRead the full article on our medium page to learn more about why Sociocracy matters and how it s transforming our team!\n\n---\n\nContact Us\n\nHome\nAbout Us\nSociocracy Course\nLalkul DRep\nReports and Articles\nContact Us\nHome\nAbout Us\nSociocracy Course\nLalkul DRep\nReports and Articles\nContact Us\nMoreHomeAbout UsSociocracy CourseLalkul DRepReports and ArticlesContact Us\nHome\nAbout Us\nSociocracy Course\nLalkul DRep\nReports and Articles\nContact Us\nWe d love to discuss novel approaches.\nPhotrek can lighten your load and illuminate your path.
