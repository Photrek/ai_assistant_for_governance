    "input": "",
    "output": "July 23, 2024\nEMURGO\nA previous blog on DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in Japan mentioned that the nation had put forth blockchain-related regulatory reform to provide official recognition to DAOs.\nThis marked a significant step at a national level to allow limited liability companies (LLCs) to start forming DAOs to raise capital in the form of NFTs.\nEMURGO, a blockchain technology company established in Japan in 2015, has been a supporter of Web3 adoption by organizations and businesses in Japan through local workshops. These have raised awareness on a variety of industry topics such as real-world asset tokenization, distributed blockchain governance, and other Web3 products & services.\nThis blog will further examine DAOs in Japan and EMURGO s activities to facilitate their adoption.\nJapan approved legislative reform that allows limited liability companies or LLCs to raise capital unlimitedly through an NFT (membership token) by deregulating the existing financial laws.\nThe potential benefits of this new DAO-related law include:\nThe Japan DAO Association was formed in Japan to assess legitimate DAO applications/projects and DAO-related tools for the public.\nThey act as an initial gatekeeper for Japan s growing DAO ecosystem, providing a necessary filter for other organizations and the public:\nThus far, this group has given preliminary approval to several DAO-related tools in the Cardano ecosystem and has recognized them as legitimate potential tools for DAO creation.\nRead more: Japan s DAO Association lists Yoroi Wallet, NMKR, and Clarity as DAO-related tools.\nDue to this preliminary approval in Japan, Cardano is pushing ahead to become an established network in Japan for DAOs. The DAO tools mentioned in this preliminary approval are:\nJapan s DAO Association mentions the need for a secure and tech-verified crypto wallet as it is considered a critical tool of DAO infrastructure.\nA digital token or crypto wallet provides basic and essential DAO functions such as enabling members to hold DAO membership tokens in the form of NFTs, providing voting power, signing transactions, and allowing various interactions between members.\nA DAO-approved crypto wallet also needs to be safe to use, as it is the cornerstone of the entire system. The seed or recovery phrase for the wallet needs to be random enough to be completely safe.\nThe wallet s private key must have strong encryption while being user-friendly for those unfamiliar with blockchain and crypto to easily and safely participate in DAO activities.\nBy being listed as one of the initial tools approved for DAOs, Yoroi Wallet s various user functions and features are considered to be an important DAO infrastructure piece that can be used by other companies and projects looking to form DAOs in Japan.\nThe next DAO tool mentioned by the DAO Foundation is a membership token or NFT that enables DAO members to know they are officially a part of a DAO and have access to its rights and obligations.\nIn most designs, the membership token is an NFT or non-fungible token held in a wallet such as Yoroi.\nThe NFT metadata contains and secures the relevant information regarding the DAO, individual members, and anything else deemed necessary to the DAO s function. This NFT token also serves to access a DAO s governance platform for members.\nNMKR is a Cardano NFT and tokenization platform built on the Cardano blockchain. It has all the necessary tools for DAOs to mint NFT membership tokens and tokenize company assets. NMKR s NFTs are also easily integrated with other popular digital token wallets in the Cardano ecosystem.\nRead more: How NMKR adds value to businesses and brands in the form of NFTs\nThe next tool given preliminary approval is Clarity, a DAO governance and treasury management system. It provides a platform with tools for other DAOs to use to publish proposals, track voting power, transparently show voting results, and provide its users with control over the shared resources.\nClarity is a DAO tools platform that is native to Cardano.\nThe project provides a way to register the policy ID used for voting for a DAO, a space to publish proposals, set up voting rounds, and manage the treasury.\nIt s a complete solution for those wanting to launch a DAO on the Cardano network.\nTo advance with the final approval, some details still have to be finalized.\nFirst, there needs to be localization as the tools above must provide a Japanese interface and documentation.\nThe second is to eliminate fraud scenarios through a wallet multi-sig implementation to prevent any one person or member from manipulating DAO funds.\nJapan s newly formed DAO Association held a DAO awareness in-person event last month, in Takamatsu, Japan to discuss how DAOs could accelerate regional development by making it easier for local businesses to raise capital and market their products or services.\nIt included the participation of over fifty companies and individuals looking to set up a DAO in the country, including Hirai Takuya, the ex-digital minister of Japan.\nEMURGO, NMKR, and Clarity participated to present their insights and technology to the gathered audience.\nRead more: Coindesk recap of the event (Japanese)\nIn the long run, the larger objective is to kickstart the effort to attract new DAO initiatives to Japan through increased awareness and collaboration. Ultimately, this can help grow the native DAO ecosystem, particularly by utilizing the readily available tools of the Cardano ecosystem.\nWant to learn more about Web3 in Japan?\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for more related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Why Decentralized Blockchain Governance is Important Cardano EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "July 2, 2024\nEMURGO\nWith more emphasis on decentralization and distribution within blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps), governance has become an important topic of discussion.\nMore users of blockchain ecosystems and their dApps want to learn how decisions are made that can impact their sustainability and governance.\nThe Cardano blockchain aims to become the first truly decentralized and distributed blockchain with a community-run governance model.\nTo achieve this, the Cardano community has been working out the details of CIP-1694 to implement a distributed on-chain governance model maintained and updated by the community.\nIn addition, a member-based organization, Intersect, has been launched with Committees and Special Interests or Working Groups to support the implementation of CIP-1694. Discussions have also been held on the Cardano Constitution, the test network for governance (SanchoNet), and relevant tooling features to use on SanchoNet (GovTool), among other things.\nThis blog will further discuss the importance of decentralized governance and its importance to the future sustainability of a blockchain such as Cardano.\nRelated reading:\nDecentralized governance is a style of decision-making and administration in which division and dissemination of central authority, activities, rights, and responsibilities are spread around several institutions or members within an organization, network, or group.\nDecentralization can happen at several levels of governance.\nSometimes, local governments can be decentralized under a centralized national body or vice versa.\nIn any case, there are different models of decentralization.\nIn most cases, however, decentralized governance is applied to support democratic state-run, municipal governments, grassroots governance, or public services.\nDecentralized governance ensures the delegation of power and authority. It helps to empower local-level administrative wings by incentivizing active public participation in shaping decision-making for their community.\nCompared to centralized companies, organizations, or applications administered and run by a few core stakeholders or developers, a blockchain network run by its community can have several advantages that bring more transparency, democracy, and accountability to the entire network.\nIn a decentralized governance framework, the people or the users will have decision-making power through open proposals, collective voting, access to essential records, and more.\nIf this is applied to a blockchain network, important proposals, votes, and other records can be stored transparently on-chain.\nThe developers and users that make up the community will be devising and deciding on how to sustain the network over time, as opposed to a centralized model in which a few core insiders may be incentivized to act in their interest without thorough accountability. It s a natural way for a system of checks and balances.\nNow, through open-source blockchain technology such as Cardano, users on a global scale can vote, store records, propose ideas, tokenize assets, transact, and a whole lot more instantly.\nThis empowers and enables the community of users to grow together and truly decide on what is best for the network.\nCardano s model for decentralized governance is different from other networks because it uses different governance institutions and a form of liquid democracy. There are three main bodies:\nIn a liquid democracy, members or users can share their votes and support specific policies rather than relying on representatives who may be subject to other interests. In this type of system, delegates are repositories of voting power. The moment they cast their vote, they do it with the assigned voting power on a case-by-case basis. With this system, the Principal-Agent Problem is reduced since, at any point, a delegate can lose all of their voting power if the users perceive their voices aren t being reflected.\nCardano also has a separate off-chain member organization, Intersect, to support decentralized governance initiatives for its sustainability. Intersect organizes committees and groups to work on certain tasks related to Cardano s evolution and decentralization. Anyone can join Intersect by registering on its website.\nRead more: Explaining the bodies in Cardano governance\nIntersect is the main anchor for participation.\nPeople can join in on the different aspects of shaping Cardano governance via this organization.\nAdditionally, Intersect will help to lead the drafting of the Cardano Constitution through its committees and groups.\nA Cardano Constitutional Convention will also be held to present the draft of the Cardano Constitution for community ratification.\nWant to receive more information about Cardano governance and Intersect?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other blockchain governance-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "Cardano is the first blockchain to evolve from scientific peer review and cryptographic research methods. It has been designed from inception to be environmentally friendly and offer an open-source blockchain platform to host decentralized applications that can provide accessible economic services to the world.\nMay 25, 2023\nWatch the Cardano whiteboard overview\nByron\nFoundation\nShelley\nDecentralization\nGoguen\nSmart Contracts\nBasho\nScaling\nVoltaire\nGovernance\nByron\nFoundation\nNamed after George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron or Lord Byron as he was known, was an English Romantic poet. The Byron era is the first era of the Cardano blockchain, and the kickstart of the entire Cardano blockchain.\nThe actual start of Cardano can be tracked back to 2015, as the founders of Cardano identified three blockchain-specific challenges to solve: scalability to onboard more users and improve blockchain throughput, interoperability to integrate functionalities and features with other systems, and sustainability for Cardano to last for generations.\nIn order to solve these challenges, a new open-source, decentralized blockchain network needed to be designed and developed.\nWith that objective, the Byron era officially began in September 2017 with the launch of the federated era of Cardano. In this era, the founding entities of Cardano would establish the basic infrastructure for Cardano including launching the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus protocol to enable transactions, developing user wallets, facilitating exchange listings for its native cryptocurrency ADA, and building the worldwide Cardano community.\nIn Cardano, important upgrades are implemented via a hard fork combinator (HFC) event, a technical term used to indicate the combination of certain processes or things. In this case, a HFC merges protocols, thereby enabling the smooth transition of Cardano without blockchain network interruption or restart.\nThe Shelley era as mentioned above transitioned Cardano to a decentralized network and was marked by the Shelley hard fork.\nThe Mary hard fork started the multi-asset support of the Cardano blockchain. During the Byron and the start of Shelley eras, ADA was the only asset on the Cardano ledger.\nThe Alonzo hard fork introduced smart contracts to Cardano with Plutus, the Cardano blockchain s smart contract programming language which is based on Haskell.\nVasil is a continuation of the upgrades from Alonzo and also belongs to the Goguen era.\nHydra is the creation of state channels in Cardano.

    "input": "",
    "output": "February 11, 2025\nEMURGO\nToday, blockchain and Web3 have become one of the most searched-about topics in emerging technologies. Cryptocurrencies and related sectors such as NFTs and decentralized finance have gotten more attention in the mainstream media. More traditional companies have also experimented with or have integrated NFT-related technologies into their branding campaigns.\nThus, more and more career professionals are looking to learn about blockchain and their potential business use cases. At the same time, an increasing number of traditional web developers are also looking to acquire blockchain development skillsets to empower their careers.\nIn this blog, we ll dive into the various benefits that can be derived from learning blockchain with EMURGO Academy and other learning tips that can apply to a wide range of career fields and jobs.\nHere s a discussion of the benefits of blockchain for a variety of jobs and professions.\nBlockchain started to gain attention as a technology underpinning Bitcoin. At the time, it was, and remains, a technical subject that requires an understanding of computer technology and related sciences for those looking to be core developers.\nCertain requirements place it within the knowledge realm of computer science and network engineering, and those looking to enter blockchain from these areas will have an easier onboarding process when learning about technical blockchain-related aspects.\nRead more: How Aiken is changing the game for blockchain application development\nMuch of the blockchain and Web3 space is dominated by those proficient and with some experience in the field. There are generally two different levels of blockchain development.\nOne is at the network protocol level, which means programming a blockchain network itself.\nThe second is at the application level. Here, this deals with the blockchain network s smart contracts and applications (dApps) that are built on top of the network, which is what most blockchain users utilize. Both levels demand an understanding of technical subjects that can help when designing systems.\nAn example of this is the aforementioned Aiken, a smart contract language that allows developers to quickly launch Cardano dApps. It is a domain-specific language designed specifically for developing Cardano smart contracts and is considered to be easier for traditional web developers to learn to use due to its familiarity.\nBlockchain is not a technology meant only for engineers and those with a technical background to utilize. It s an ecosystem of networks, layers, and applications that are created for users of all types including individuals and organizations. Through the usage of this technology and related applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged for more accessible financial services, NFTs for real-world asset tokenization, and more.\nBlockchain is a new global market that crosses all borders and never stops. Those in traditional finance and investors should be aware of this growing space so they can stay ahead of the latest financial trends and technology.\nNew areas of blockchain-based finance such as DeFi are quickly gaining greater adoption and have the immense potential to reshape the traditional financial landscape by providing more accessible access to financial services on a global scale. Other areas of development also include asset tokenization which is increasingly being considered to be the future of finance by legacy institutions.\nRead more: Why business professionals should start learning about DeFi\nAs blockchain grows in adoption, regulations and compliance become more vital for everyone involved. First, the legal status of blockchain assets is discussed regularly and compliance is a fast-evolving topic that must be addressed by companies. Investors and individuals must also stay updated on evolving regulations for tax and other purposes.\nSecond, blockchain offers many new tools to the legal profession, from immutable contracts to verifiable digital signatures. Those who enter the space early will be able to apply these new technologies and grow their career skills in the legal world.\nThere have been increasing instances of plagiarized research papers, essays, and other types of academic fraud, affecting academics and educational institutions. Blockchain and NFTs now offer a potential solution to these challenges by providing tracking and verifiable proof of an author s identity and credentials, thereby providing more trust within academia.\nRead more: Learn how NFTs can solve the issue of plagiarism\nThe younger generation is one of the biggest consumers of emerging technological trends such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and blockchain. Students who are more aware and caught up with the basics of blockchain technology have greater opportunities to apply these skills to related careers and other individual pursuits.\nOne of the most difficult aspects of being a musician or artist is the distribution and monetization of a person s work. In the past, these pipelines were dominated by centralized actors such as art galleries and related agencies who had the authority to control musicians and artists.\nNFTs have changed this equation, allowing new artists to distribute their creative work globally and more efficiently while staying in control over their intellectual property. Visual arts, images, music, and novels are being distributed with NFTs with transparency and cost-effectiveness.\nRead more: How NFTs can bring value to music artists\nAt the start of the blockchain industry, the private IT sector and governments were at odds with each other. Today, the environment is changing, and more nations are embracing blockchain technology with greater interest.\nFor this reason, there is a greater demand from government officials to know how blockchain works to be positioned to harness its impact on society and the economy.\nBlockchain is a decentralized and permissionless technology that is accessible to all. It can be used as a technological foundation for a variety of use cases in finance, asset tokenization, data management, authentication, and many more.\nAre you a traditional web developer or wanting to become a blockchain developer? Are you a business professional needing to learn about the latest industry trends in Web3 and blockchain?\nOr are you someone who is interested in blockchain but lacks a basic understanding of the technology behind it?\nEMURGO provides a range of specially tailored blockchain learning courses for technical and non-technical learners through EMURGO Academy.

    "input": "",
    "output": "February 6, 2025\nEMURGO\nRWA (real-world assets) tokenization is a trending discussion topic within blockchain and finance circles that continues to gather increasing attention.\nIn previous blogs, we discussed the potential benefits and advantages of tokenizing various asset sectors including precious metals, premium spirits, diamonds, books, and also real estate (RE), through the use of blockchain technology and the issuance of digital tokens.\nConsidering the market size of various asset classes, real estate (commercial and residential property) is among the largest and most traditional with an expected value in the trillions, according to different reports. Compared to the emerging blockchain and Web3 sector by market size, the global real estate market is much bigger by many orders of magnitude.\nThis contrast shows the disparity between the rapidly growing yet nascent nature of blockchain and real estate, with many blockchain-based or Web3 products & services under development to find a product-market fit.\nIn the case of real estate, its considerable market value and relative lack of digitization offer a compelling opportunity for blockchain to transform its practices and provide unprecedented value to investors and companies looking to buy or sell real estate in the future.\nRE is a market that relies on signed contracts and land or property deeds to allocate ownership to individuals, corporations, or other entities. Depending on the location of the property, many of these records can be relatively difficult to access as they are typically recorded in local municipalities and/or on physical paper in emerging and underdeveloped markets. Even in more developed regions, the level of access can depend on the amount of records digitization that has been undertaken to enable the public to freely view property records via online searches.\nReal estate tokenization refers to the digitization of real estate assets by issuing digital tokens (usually in the form of NFTs) on a blockchain network to represent the actual physical property. Leveraging the immutable and transparent properties of a decentralized blockchain network, all asset transactions and important information related to the RE asset would be automatically recorded, verified, and stored on the network with anyone able to view it at any time.\nAnybody or any organization interested in transacting a tokenized RE asset could potentially list, buy, and sell it by transferring the digital token via a token wallet, in line with local regulations.\nThe NFT metadata would contain the property s details, which are used to identify it, and any other essential information for potential buyers. Holding the NFT, in turn, means ownership for the person or entity controlling the wallet.\nRelated reading:\nTokenized assets can enjoy many benefits, and real estate is no exception. In many ways, the race is two-way: blockchain developers and projects are trying to expand the blockchain market, by delivering products & services the market demands, and real estate businesses are looking to access and connect more buyers and sellers for commissions.\nIn a previous blog, we listed some of the major advantages of real estate tokenization, including:\nHowever, there are also other advantages that real estate tokenization can offer.\nRead more: What s the potential for the asset tokenization market?\nThe tokenization of any asset is a thorough process.

    "instruction": "5 Blockchain Governance Trends to Look For in 2025 EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "February 4, 2025\nEMURGO\nThe blockchain industry is entering a new phase in 2025, with more focus and emphasis placed on decentralized governance, and other trending narratives.\nHaving a few core developers manage and maintain the activities of a blockchain network can pose an increasing vulnerability as it experiences increased user activity and is constantly being built upon by more decentralized applications.\nTo mitigate these risks, a decentralized blockchain protocol aims to become more widely distributed in its technical infrastructure and decision-making processes, with more nodes securing the network and more of its community of users having a prominent voice in governance-related matters.\nThis is where a blockchain network s governance structure plays an essential role in providing a transparent solution by enabling the community to run and decide how the network should function.\nFor the Cardano network and ecosystem, the recent implementation of the Plomin hard fork unlocked full on-chain decentralization features and governance actions for DReps and the community.\nIn this blog, we ll further discuss 5 trending topics regarding decentralized blockchain governance for this year.\nOne of the most common models for on-chain governance is enabling voting by the blockchain network s nodes, validators, and other key community stakeholders. In a decentralized blockchain, anyone can participate and run a node (server) or validator to help secure and distribute the network s reach. By possessing an updated copy of the blockchain s transaction data and supporting the validation of user transactions, nodes serve a valuable purpose in securing the network.\nSince these nodes have to be set up, maintained, and updated by community participants interested in the ecosystem, the node operators make up a natural voting block regarding governance. They have a vested interest in the longevity of the blockchain and are also further incentivized by the protocol s rewards.\nCardano s proof-of-stake blockchain (PoS) refers to these nodes as validators or stake pools and stake pool operators (SPOs) that administer them. Any community member can decide to join a stake pool of their choosing or set up a stake pool of their own.\nRelated reading:\nWith the signing of the Cardano Constitution in December 2024 and the Plomin hard fork, on-chain voting for Cardano governance actions is enabled for Cardano community stakeholders such as DReps and SPOs. DReps are one of the three primary governing bodies in Cardano s future governance structure, providing a mechanism for community-driven decision-making for those who delegate their voting power to them. These DReps have the right to vote on proposals and governance actions submitted by the Cardano community. As another core governing body on the Cardano network, SPOs also represent the community segment that supports the network s infrastructure by securing it through the ADA delegated to their pools and voting on certain initiatives.\nA blockchain s reach and potential are built upon its community of users and their participation in the activity. If more users are interested in a particular network and developers are actively building and maintaining applications, this attracts more potential new users and developers.\nWhile it may be hard to distinguish and specify a specific metric to quantify a single blockchain community, the biggest tend to be the ones with the largest market capitalization, number of wallet addresses, number of native dApps and users, and developer activity on GitHub, among others.\nWith the transition towards decentralized governance, there has been a push to have the community of any given blockchain play a more active role in governance. This group represents the largest block in any ecosystem, and they must have a voice in shaping a network s future, similar to citizens being able to vote in national elections.\nA key feature of Cardano s decentralized governance model is Governance Actions or proposals that anyone in the Cardano community can submit. Through the integration of the Plomin hard fork, community members can create governance actions to deliver community-led changes. To initiate a proposal, they must make a small ADA deposit, which is fully refunded after voting ends.\nIn Cardano, community members can also participate in governance by delegating their voting power to a DRep, abstaining from a proposal vote, or submitting a vote of no-confidence through their Yoroi Wallet interface.\nAnother trend that can accelerate in 2025 is formalizing the governance process. Today, many of the blockchains that are experimenting with governance have looser rules regarding the process. This creates confusion and a sense that there is an inner circle in the know, with outsiders unable to access this information.\nThis is why creating more transparent and fairer rules for a governance model is imperative to ensure trust in the community.\nIn Cardano, Intersect is a member-based organization open to anyone who supports the formal implementation of various community-led initiatives focused on governance. With Committees and Working Groups, community members can join Intersect and these open groups, helping to work on tasks and goals that further strengthen Cardano s governance.\nFor tools, Cardano GovTool has also been released to allow the community to easily connect their wallets and explore and govern Cardano through a unified dashboard. Furthermore, DReps and the community have a say in ratifying the signed version of the Cardano Constitution which is ongoing.\nRead more: Explaining Intersect s Committees and Working Groups\nAnother essential feature of a governance model is elections. The people in charge of a nation or network must be accountable to the community and ensure a fair and transparent process. Thus, elections are also an important part of the governance discussion.\nBlockchains are globally distributed information systems connecting people from many countries and cultures. This creates unique challenges in making clear who can be elected and who can vote.\nIn Cardano, as mentioned above, users can utilize their Yoroi Wallet to select which DRep they would like to delegate their voting power. Last year, Intersect also held elections for positions in its Committees and two new non-executive directors to join its Governing Board, with more elections on the way completed through its Member Portal.\nAnyone can register to become a DRep through the GovTools site.\nTo take a blockchain network s decentralization to the next step, there needs to be a large and expanding number of teams from various parts of the ecosystem working on the protocol.\nThings like new node implementations, wallet upgrades, Layer-2s, and other network-related improvements need to come from interested developers, users, and other projects. Discussing who can propose these changes and how they should be adopted is one of the many vital items a governance model must decide. As the ones building and maintaining the network, developers have insights into ideas for the network and a proper governance structure gives them the resources they need.\nTo better governance in Cardano, Intersect delivers grants for specific projects and initiatives about the continuity and development of the Cardano network. Its governance tools on GovTools are fully open-sourced with an Apache 2.0 license to ensure that the tools are owned and maintained by the Cardano community itself through Intersect. Developers can also submit feedback on bugs and ideas via the feedback button on GovTools, join the Intersect Governance Tools Working Groups, and contribute directly to the open repositories.\nDownload Yoroi Wallet\nYoroi Wallet is an open-source Cardano light wallet developed by EMURGO. With mobile and desktop versions available for download, users can get quick access to participating in Cardano blockchain governance including delegating to a Delegated Representative (DRep) and voting.\nTo download Yoroi and get more information, visit here.\nTo receive more content on Cardano governance, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "The Advantages of Interoperable NFTs EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 29, 2025\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) have an interesting history. They were one of the first assets exclusive to the blockchain smart contract era. Fungible assets started with Bitcoin and were the main type traded during the first generation of blockchains.\nFor this reason, they became closely linked to their parent blockchains and, for a long time, connected to a specific blockchain ecosystem.\nNow, this has evolved due to the advances in blockchain technology and the embrace of a wider multi-chain approach by users and developers.\nLet s go over the five benefits brought by this increased interoperability and its effects on NFTs and asset tokenization.\nFirst, let s quickly recap the history of the NFT.\nThe non-fungible token was first created on Ethereum. It was created by Larva Labs Studio, which attached an ID (identifier) to a token-minting smart contract, creating the first format for a token with a distinguishable supply.\nLater, a project called Crypto Kitties would standardize the idea and create the ERC-721 contract, which they would open source. This quick-started the NFT craze in 2017, which catapulted NFTs into the mainstream for the first time.\nHowever, due to the properties of that particular ecosystem, locking these assets contributed to creating silos for the NFTs.\nRelated reading:\nLuckily, improvements in blockchain bridges have reversed this trend and unlocked new value for NFTs by expanding user bases and connecting buyers and sellers across popular blockchain ecosystems. Now, NFT assets can migrate between networks and become truly multi-chain.\nRecently, real-world asset tokenization has also become a trending narrative, sparking the interest of businesses and retail consumers, and leading to more potential use cases for NFTs which are key to tokenization.\nLet s review the advantages of this model.\nThe main advantage to NFTs is that multi-chain capabilities allow them to access more liquidity due to an increase in buyers and sellers. Each network has its buyers interested in acquiring the NFTs, so selling them is far easier than when locked to a single network.\nLiquidity also allows for more stable prices. The NFTs can hold their value for longer periods, making them more attractive for some. All contribute to creating a more healthy ecosystem for NFTs that can attract a wider group of new and existing users.\nFor those tokenizing assets, this holds great potential and promise as NFTs that are interoperable can make their asset more liquid compared to traditional transaction methods which might be limited to a specific geographical area or single blockchain network.\nNext, multi-chain NFTs can have access to a bigger pool of potential buyers. When NFTs are locked to one network, it can be difficult to stand out. Many potentially good projects are simply drowned by the many offerings and are never given a chance.\nIn a multi-chain ecosystem, creators can find buyers in many different blockchains. They have a higher chance of reaching an audience and becoming successful, contributing to a more dynamic ecosystem for NFTs.\nEspecially for businesses and individuals tokenizing real-world assets and looking to maximize the potential buyer base for their assets, multi-chain NFTs can hold a lot more promising potential.\nSilos inside networks lead to potential stagnation as blockchain developers don t have enough competition to push to create new things.\nFrom a developer s perspective of NFT products and services, multi-chain NFTs are nurtured from many blockchains, each with different ideas, resulting in more experimentation.\nThese assets consistently push the boundaries of what is possible and create lively competition between projects. All of this leads to a more innovative atmosphere that helps all networks grow.\nNFTs locked to a single network are bound by the fortunes of that one blockchain. These move in cycles; there are periods of growth, consolidation, and even contraction. Therefore, if a project launches only in one blockchain ledger, they are subject to the whims of the cycle.\nA multi-chain NFT has a better chance of being exposed to different network cycles. If one network is no longer getting new users, another might be in a period of growth, resulting in more demand and liquidity for NFTs that are interoperable.\nOften, a blockchain only has a handful of big NFT collections. Many NFT projects are limited in their value due to the constraints of the given ecosystem and the number of users it has.\nHowever, multi-chain NFTs can attract users from several networks, meaning more collections can reach or even break that ceiling. More valuable collections also mean more trading activity and more adoption for the blockchain industry as a whole.\nAs more NFTs, used in a variety of use cases, are adopted and evolve to fit the needs of users, the ecosystem as a whole will continue to expand and onboard more businesses and users. This feedback loop inevitably brings more awareness, resources, and development to NFTs.\nRead more: Things to consider when launching a NFT collection\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It provides a user-friendly platform that enables businesses and individuals to create NFTs without having to require coding skills.\nTo date, NMKR s NFT tools have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets, including diamonds, e-books, and gaming items.\nIts various products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support allow businesses and individuals to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even provide traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nWant to stay up-to-date on the latest business use cases for NFTs, such as real-world asset tokenization?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "input": "",
    "output": "January 23, 2025\nEMURGO\nThe official draft of the Cardano constitution was signed in December 2024 and will soon be handed over to the DReps and community for an on-chain vote. Thus, Cardano s decentralized governance era continues to progress rapidly.\nAlongside the vote, the Plomin hard fork and the changes it will bring are among the next critical pieces.\nIn this blog, we ll review the significant blockchain governance changes it will introduce and discuss its implications for the Cardano community and ecosystem.\nThe Plomin hard fork was initially slated to be the second upgrade of the two-part Chang hard fork. It was renamed in memory of Cardano community contributor Matthew Plomin. The Plomin hard fork is the follow-up upgrade to the first part of the Chang hard fork, integrated in 2024.\nA blockchain hard fork updates the software across the distributed network of nodes that validate and secure a blockchain such as Cardano. As each node (or validator in Cardano) follows the protocol that governs the network, it must adopt the upgrade to continue operating. Hard forks enable new functionalities, bolster security, and streamline network operations, among other benefits.\nThis hard fork will deliver the second part of the governance tools outlined in CIP-1694, a proposal documenting Cardano s decentralized governance structure. Once completed, the full decentralized governance model will be implemented and recorded on-chain in the Cardano blockchain network. Thus, the Plomin upgrade will be the first blockchain hard fork to utilize on-chain governance to enhance transparency and accountability by network stakeholders, including voting by the Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).\nThe main feature of the Plomin hard fork is the full implementation of delegated representatives (DReps) with treasury withdrawals enabled, and completing the transition from the technical bootstrapping phase of CIP-1694.\nRelated reading:\nAfter that point, DReps can vote on future governance actions with their own ADA and any ADA delegated to them by the community. Also, once the hard fork is completed, all Cardano governance actions will be ready for use.\nHere are the governance actions:\nThis is very important since anyone in the Cardano community can trigger a governance action and put it to a vote.\nFinally, the Plomin hard fork means the community will vote on the Cardano constitution, ratified by the delegates during the Cardano Constitutional Convention. Now that the DReps are fully operational, the community can vote to accept the constitution through their supported DRep. The date for this network-wide vote has yet to be determined.\nAs we mentioned, this is the first time the SPOs have had the chance to vote for a hard fork. This means that if the SPOs vote against the upgrade, it will not proceed to be pushed to the main Cardano network.\nThe minimum threshold for approving a hard fork is 51 of the network s stake, with more than 60 of SPOs approving it as of writing. This means the vote has passed; therefore, the Plomin upgrade will happen. The governance action for the Plomin hard fork expires on January 29. Since it s expected to pass, the network will upgrade after that date.\nTo connect to the network, the SPOs need to upgrade to node 10.1.4. As of January 22, 78 of the network nodes had upgraded to the new version, signaling they were ready to accept the upgrade, while around 60 of exchange liquidity has been reported as Ready for the hard fork.\nCardano s Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) will also vote on whether to support the hard fork. The vote threshold to reach is 5 out of 7 constitutional votes. The current ICC is composed of EMURGO, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Intersect, Cardano Atlantic Council, Cardano Japan, and Eastern Cardano Council. As a member, EMURGO has cast a supporting vote for the hard fork. See the current voting status here.\nRead more: Explaining the Interim Constitutional Committee\nFinally, while some Cardano wallets may not transition to the new Plomin node version, Yoroi Wallet users can be assured that their wallets will be ready. See the Wallets section on the Plomin Upgrade webpage for details on which wallets will support the hard fork. Users of these other wallets should consider this and take necessary actions. Other items such as voting status, supporting dApps, and other information can also be found on the page.\nOnce the Plomin hard fork is enacted, the Voltaire era will be fully implemented. From that point forward, it ll be up to the Cardano community to decide what comes next and to create a new roadmap for the network.\nIt s the start of a new path for the Cardano network. The community has to take charge and begin tracking the governance actions, register or delegate to a DRep, and engage with Intersect to build the future of the Cardano blockchain.\nWant to learn more about Cardano community governance?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for updates and related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Here Are 5 Benefits of Token Metadata for Asset Tokenization EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 22, 2025\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) are one of the most intriguing digital assets created using blockchain technology due to their versatility. Given their unique technological properties, NFTs have been used in a widening number of real use cases including media, finance, insurance, charity, and more, to represent real-world assets as digital tokens recorded and transacted over a decentralized blockchain network.\nThe source of this versatility is the token metadata which is programmable and included in each NFT. It makes them capable of representing many things using a single type of digital token standard.\nHere, we ll explain how this is made possible and the benefits of customizable token metadata for businesses and users.\nAn NFT is an entry into the distributed ledger of a blockchain using a specific ID. It is essentially a unique token that is issued and recorded on a blockchain network which can then represent various real-world assets.\nIn this model, every NFT has an ID in the form of a cryptographic hash to make sure it cannot be duplicated. That separates it and makes it an individually unique asset. This contrasts with fungible tokens where every token in the supply shares the same identity, making them interchangeable.\nThat specific ID is recorded on the blockchain ledger. However, it s just a set of characters of a fixed length and is unable to record more data.\nRelated reading:\nThis is where the token metadata plays an important role in enabling NFTs to represent real-world assets on-chain.\nToken metadata refers to data about data. In the case of a blockchain transaction, this could be the block number, the time stamp, the epoch, etc. In the case of an asset the NFT represents, it can contain relevant information about the asset to make it transparent to potential buyers. All this information helps to validate the transaction itself for future reference. The metadata is important because it is a record of the information that lives outside of the data on the blockchain. Furthermore, this token metadata can be programmed and input by the party issuing the NFT. For those created on Cardano, the token metadata can store more data compared to other leading blockchain networks.\nSome benefits of having programmable token metadata for NFTs include:\nToken metadata, at least on Cardano, is recorded on the nodes or validators of the network. This makes it as secure as other information saved in the blockchain. That provides a high level of security that cannot be matched by other systems.\nMetadata recorded in this way can be traced by anyone. Any changes to it are also logged, so anyone can track which party made changes, when these happened, and what data was affected. All this makes information far more reliable and trackable.\nThis makes tokenized asset transactions and verification more reliable, transparent, and secure from the perspective of buyers and sellers.\nToken metadata can also be immutable meaning once it s set, it can never be changed, even by the NFT creators. Assets that need a high level of security benefit a lot from this feature, as it ensures the information contained in the metadata can never change.\nMost NFTs out there use immutable data because it is also easier to set it up. If the metadata never changes, then there is no need to set up complicated permissions for developers to ensure the data is never compromised.\nThis adds to the trust of tokenized assets that require immutability such as NFTs representing items that must retain a clear, unaltered history of certain data.\nOf course, token metadata can also be mutable, meaning that it can change over time as is the case with Dynamic NFTs. Mutable metadata is useful when the asset is expected to have a life cycle that needs to be tracked.\nLogistics solutions, gaming, and real estate assets, among others, can benefit greatly from this feature, as the changes the items experience as they move through the custody chain can be reflected in the token metadata. Since each update is trackable, it becomes much more convenient for those monitoring the movement of the asset.\nRead more: Explaining Dynamic NFTs in Cardano\nToken metadata as a data storage solution can be more cost-effective than centralized cloud alternatives. Also, if the metadata is immutable, the cost has to be paid only once, when the token is minted. All these can make metadata a more affordable option for recording important information.\nAdditionally, metadata can be easier to access since it s publicly available. Anyone using a blockchain explorer can check this information, and therefore a business with multiple parties has better information dissemination.\nToken metadata doesn t need to be passive, meaning it only works as a record. Metadata can actively be read by smart contracts and automatically activate certain conditions based on the results in a resource-efficient manner.\nMetadata becomes very important when it is combined with programs that read it. Asset tokenization, logistics, finance, and many other use cases can benefit dramatically from this ability which sets NFTs apart from other solutions.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It provides a user-friendly platform that enables businesses and individuals to create NFTs without requiring coding skills.\nIts NFT tools have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets, including diamonds, e-books, and gaming items.\nIts various products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support allow businesses and individuals to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even provide traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nInterested in discovering more about NFTs and business use cases for real-world asset tokenization?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Explainer How NFT Marketplaces Work EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 16, 2025\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) are popular digital assets in resale or secondary markets, which are usually NFT marketplaces. They are often launched in special editions or limited collections by sought-after creators and brands seeking to promote a certain product, reward fans and consumers, and/or generate additional revenue.\nOnce purchased from these primary sources, those who missed out and want to own those NFTs typically move to an NFT marketplace.\nOwners of NFTs often buy their tokens in these secondary marketplaces because collections tend to become higher in demand after an initial sale and any accompanying social media buzz. This sometimes contributes to increased trading volumes generated over time keeping the NFT collections relevant and desired by others.\nAn NFT marketplace is primarily an online platform for reselling NFTs. It creates markets where NFT owners or sellers can find potential buyers using different economic models. This enables price discovery and signals the latest NFT collection prices to the market, allowing buyers and sellers to gain a greater understanding of the market price of an NFT asset.\nThere are two main modes of how this can be achieved.\nRelated reading:\nMuch like other marketplaces for real-world assets, a seller can set the price of their NFT and wait for someone to bid on it. They can set any price they desire. Much of this depends on how much information they have before the sale. If the listed NFT goes a long time without any interest from buyers, sellers can lower the price.\nIn some variations, the seller can receive price counteroffers from buyers.\nA second option is an auction. In this model, an NFT seller can establish a floor price and have potential bidders compete with each other by incrementally raising their bidding price until the NFT is sold or the time runs out.\nThe seller can also set a hidden minimum price. If the NFT does not reach that desired set price, the seller is not forced to give the token away.\nThe NFT marketplace itself typically makes revenue from fees charged regardless of the sale mode. In the first model, a portion of the confirmed selling price goes to the platform. In the auction model, the seller has to pay a fee to start the auction. They may also generate revenue from other sources depending on the size of their marketplace.\nNow, let s discuss the types of NFT marketplaces.\nThese NFT marketplaces are often independent, third-party Web3 projects that are not connected to the original NFT mint or sale.\nThis blog will further discuss how these NFT marketplaces work and their implications for NFT buyers and sellers.\nNFT marketplaces are usually divided into two broad categories: centralized and decentralized.\nIn many ways, they mirror the way many cryptocurrency exchanges developed, with centralized exchanges taking control of users assets, and decentralized on-chain platforms using automated smart contracts to decentralize the process.\nCentralized marketplaces are platforms that work crypto wallets by holding NFTs in the custody of the company of developers. They usually create on the backend of the platform and assign them to the users profiles.\nFind out more: How to store, send, and receive Cardano NFTs in your wallet\nSellers can deposit their NFTs into these wallets whose private keys are under the platform developers control. The transactions happen on the back end of the marketplace by updates to a database that changes ownership of the NFTs. No activity is logged on-chain from these transfers between users.\nBecause there is no on-chain transaction, the fees of the marketplace can be lower and go to the owners of the marketplace. Additionally, the marketplace can support different blockchain networks, allowing users to buy and sell NFTs from several different networks in one platform. This is an attractive selling point for these marketplaces to onboard more buyers and sellers.\nTransactions in these marketplaces can also be faster since there is no need to wait for blockchains to process them.\nSome drawbacks include the nature of centralized control which allows for a user s assets to be potentially stolen if the wallet s private keys are compromised due to a security breach. The lack of on-chain activity can also make it more difficult to parse transactions and filter those that are legitimate. Finally, there could be more restrictions or higher fees when trying to send or remove a listed NFT from the marketplace to a self-custody wallet.\nRead more: What is Web3?\nThe other type is a decentralized, on-chain NFT marketplace that uses smart contracts to process transactions. These platforms use Web3 technologies to create markets where there is no need to take custody of the NFT asset.\nThe NFTs are locked inside a smart contract that is not controlled by the marketplace s developers. The contract establishes rules for a sale, similar to the centralized one, with a direct selling price or auction as options. Also, it has encoded some percentages for fees to provide revenue to the platform s creators.\nThese marketplaces are self-custodian and have all their activity logged on-chain which can make it easier to parse through information regarding NFT collections and filter fake and real activity. Since using them generates network fees, they can contribute to the sustainability of a blockchain.\nHowever, decentralized NFT marketplaces can be slower than centralized ones if the blockchain network they are utilizing is congested or otherwise. User fees can also be higher during periods of peak network demand, making them more costly to use. Finally, they could have interoperability problems preventing NFTs from different chains from being traded on one decentralized marketplace. This would lower the diversity of assets offered and could be less attractive to buyers and sellers looking for the biggest user base possible.\nRead more: The power of Yoroi Wallet s self-custodial feature and its benefits\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain.

    "input": "",
    "output": "January 14, 2025\nEMURGO\nDue to the expanding awareness of blockchain and Web3, thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) are available across popular blockchain networks and millions of users worldwide.\nAccording to one report on dApp usage, daily unique active wallets (UAWs) reached an all-time high of 17.2 million in Q3 2024. While this reflects a surge of interest and adoption of blockchain and dApps, this sector still occupies a relatively niche space with early adopters because of its abstract nature, technical complexity, and complex lingo, among other factors.\nOther news-related activities, such as high-profile scams and regulatory issues, have deterred other would-be users from entering the blockchain space.\nHowever, the number of developers has vastly increased compared to a decade ago and held more or less steady over the past few years. Users of different dApps for DeFi, NFTs, and others have risen considerably even with the barriers noted above. These developers have been working to make onboarding easier for other developers and dApp users by removing or lowering such obstacles.\nIn this blog, we ll further discuss how EMURGO is facilitating a more user-friendly experience for users and developers to utilize the Cardano blockchain network.\nThe abstract, complex, and relatively new emergence of blockchain technology can still pose a considerable barrier for traditional Web2 companies, small businesses, and users to best leverage its value-adding capabilities and drive business opportunities.\nThis is where EMURGO s asset tokenization platform provides a solution and simple gateway for those wanting to enter Web3, but lacking the technological know-how and resources to get started.\nServing as a technology provider, EMURGO has collaborated with Kinka to offer its tokenization platform to tokenize physical gold, and Anzens and Encryptus to mint the USDA stablecoin, two actual real use cases for asset tokenization.\nRead more: Kinka launches on-chain gold tokens with EMURGO support\nSetting up, safeguarding, and effectively using self-custodial crypto or digital asset wallets can pose a barrier for some newcomers. While the process has significantly improved compared to the early days, things such as protecting private keys and inputting long wallet addresses can make them hard for unfamiliar users to use easily.\nTo make transactions easier and simpler for users, the Cardano network has addressed the issue of long wallet addresses that require careful attention.\nRelated reading:\nFor users of digital assets or cryptocurrencies based on the Cardano network, Yoroi Wallet provides a simple UI and UX that enables users to easily request ADA and share wallet addresses using links and QR codes for fast and secure transactions. These can easily be shared among users, replacing the complex string of long unreadable wallet addresses, making sending and receiving Cardano-based digital assets easier.\nYoroi Wallet users can quickly set up and process transactions without worrying about methodically inputting or copying wallet addresses.\nNow, users can also utilize Yoroi for ADA-fiat offramping and many other benefits such as swapping, portfolio management, and more.\nAnother major pain point for blockchain users is transaction security and fees.\nThere have been stories of dApp hacks and unwitting users signing malicious crypto transactions that drain wallet balances, a problem that discourages many and prevents mass adoption.\nA big part of the solution is to allow for transactions to be human-readable.\nThis means each step of the process should be clear and detailed enough for a person to understand. In that way, users know what they are signing with their wallets.\nIn the account-based model of most blockchains, transactions have to be processed one by one and asset-by-asset. Users thus pay high transaction fees to send just a single digital asset or token to another person. However, Cardano s eUTXO (extended unspent transaction output) model permits many assets to be sent to multiple addresses with one operation.\nThis is how Yoroi Wallet enables batch transactions for different Cardano-based digital assets. By doing so, a user can transfer multiple digital tokens, NFTs, and ADA with a single transaction, paying just one low, singular fee to move several assets simultaneously.\nYoroi Wallet screenshot\nIn the above example, we re sending ADA, three different digital tokens, and an NFT in a single transaction. All these transfers will be batched under a single one, so the transaction fee will be small, allowing for multiple on-chain results.\nA user only needs to select which tokens, NFTs, and ADA they want to send to another wallet address. All assets are included under a single transaction, which will pay a single fee for the operation. This way, users can take advantage of the batching functionality of Cardano only with the wallet s graphic interface, thereby reducing or removing unnecessary additional transaction costs.\nRead more: Explaining account-based model vs. Cardano s eUTXO model\nJumping from traditional web development to Web3 development has been a hurdle for many due to the new technical knowledge required to make the leap.\nNow, in Cardano, this has changed thanks to Aiken, a modern smart contract language specifically designed to speed up the onboarding process for web developers to build dApps on Cardano by providing a familiar programming environment. Removing much of the technical complexity and unfamiliarity in building blockchain dApps helps to streamline the development process.\nCurrently powering many of the most widely used dApps in the Cardano ecosystem, Aiken has grown into a full blockchain developer tool along with tutorials and documentation to make the onboarding process to Cardano as seamless as possible. Compared with Plutus and Marlowe, two other Cardano smart contract languages, it provides an easier experience for developers to get started. For example, Aiken:\nTo help learners properly and effectively learn to utilize Aiken, EMURGO Academy offers a complete Aiken course program with hands-on learning and expert feedback. It leads to a full understanding of the language and enables learners to build and deploy an actual dApp prototype, preparing them to build on Cardano further.\nRead more: What is Aiken and how does it help developers to build dApps quickly?\nSome wallet developers still create products with technical consumers in mind. They are not friendly to the average user, which poses a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. Especially with newer and non-technical users, any technical lingo or interface can alienate them from further usage.\nHowever, Yoroi Wallet s simple UI and services solve some of these issues.\nIn addition to the QR scan function for sending wallet addresses, it also allows users to click and automatically quickly connect on-chain to many popular Cardano dApps without worrying about figuring it out. Users can then start interacting with the dApp using their assets stored in Yoroi Wallet. It also keeps a list of all connected dApps, so users may cancel the connection at any point.\nYoroi Wallet screenshot\nThe dApp Connector enables a user to review all the dApps they have used thus far. This makes it easier to track on-chain activity and also remember useful platforms. Additionally, access to the wallet can be revoked with one click. If a dApp is attacked or turns out to be run by a team with a bad reputation, a user can quickly block any future interactions.\nYoroi s 5.0 version upgrade also provides many new features including Cardano governance participation, network switching, portfolio management, dark mode, and more. Newer features are also planned for the near future.\nDownload Yoroi now\nWith blockchain and Web3, large educational barriers still prevent proper learning. With resources scattered across the Internet, it can be hard to verify the legitimacy and accuracy of the information provided.\nSome websites lead to fake services, some articles are created to push malicious links, and educational courses provide classes taken from free internet sources.\nFor those preferring a structured and professional learning experience combined with the flexibility of remote learning, EMURGO Academy provides a wide range of technical and non-technical blockchain education courses for a global audience, designed to meet the specific learning needs of professionals and developers.\nTo learn more about the various courses, reach out to EMURGO Academy.\nFor other articles and news updates, community content hub Cardano Spot also provides a repository of content to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the ecosystem.\nAre you a business or project interested in NFTs and asset tokenization using the Cardano blockchain?

    "instruction": "Here Are 5 Ways NFTs Can Add Value to Business Marketing EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 9, 2025\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) and blockchain technology offer an expanding range of business use cases these days, going beyond verifying ownership of images and video.\nNowadays, businesses and individuals gradually recognize their power to revolutionize real-world asset ownership and transactions.\nIn the business world, many companies have experimented with integrating NFTs into their products and services, especially to optimize strategic marketing campaigns.\nWhile others may overlook this aspect, understanding how NFTs complement and make marketing practices more efficient for businesses from a cost and resource perspective can become a valuable strategy as worldwide consumers increasingly prefer digital interactions over physical ones.\nIn this blog, we ll discuss five ways NFTs can potentially transform and add unique value to business marketing strategies.\nA company s target consumer demographic and their interests and preferences are important when crafting an NFT marketing strategy.\nEvery industry and sector has its own unique consumer characteristics: music, food and beverages, collectibles, real-world assets, etc.\nThese consumer preferences should be taken into account when creating a unique narrative that pairs a company s products and services with the utilization of NFTs in a way that makes sense for both the consumer and the company. The goal should be to add value via NFTs and blockchain technology where traditional marketing practices fall short.\nFor instance, an issued NFT should seamlessly integrate into a marketing campaign and not appear as a mere afterthought. A digital token could be used as a valuable item that grants access to a company s special features, exclusive upcoming product launches, participation in limited events, discounts, and more.\nThis way, the NFT appears as a core feature and is not forced into the hands of users. It naturally becomes desired by passionate consumers first, and then expands its potential to spread organically through word-of-mouth, ultimately driving greater demand for the NFT.\nHere are some examples of how NFTs can provide marketing benefits and specific use cases.\nRelated reading:\nCustomer acquisition and retention is a basic target goal for companies and their marketing departments. There is a lot of heated competition between established brands and new up-and-comers to push new advertisements, promotions, and campaigns to achieve this goal.\nTraditionally, marketing teams have engaged in media ads, with more turning towards social media these days through the usage of influencers, key opinion leaders (KOLs), and other related strategies.\nThis is where NFTs could play an increasing role and provide a new, fresh perspective on traditional marketing strategies. Marketing teams could experiment with offering limited edition NFTs to engage with their core fan base as well as raise awareness with new consumers. By setting the criteria for distributing the NFTs, marketing teams could select the target consumers they would like to reward thereby increasing consumer loyalty.\nFor example, Coca-Cola created a multisensory friendship-inspired NFT box, including a virtual-world spin on Coca-Cola merchandise. Each NFT within the box came with a myriad of different rewards, including:\nThis strategy appealed to its core fan base as well as drove interest with more general consumers interested in emerging technologies such as Web3 and NFTs.\nSome people choose to invest in vintage wine and premium spirits as an asset class, or in other vintage assets.\nThey believe that some of these are a way to have portfolio exposure that is uncorrelated with the traditional financial markets.\nHowever, they can sometimes become vulnerable to forgery and counterfeit labeling by unscrupulous sellers. Due to the lack of transparency and knowledge, some investors may find it difficult to verify the authenticity of their intended purchases.\nThis can also be dangerous for human health, as some consumable vintage assets can be tampered with, and deemed unsafe for human consumption.\nTo counter this lack of transparency and raise trust with their younger consumers by embracing a new form of technology, wine brand Robert Mondavi and its marketers created a special NFT collection as a tribute to the year Mondavi was founded.\nThis special-edition wine collection called MCMLXVI included 1,966 uniquely designed porcelain in 1.5L wine bottles, with blends created by famous winemakers. Each bottle was represented as a generative artwork NFT that could be redeemed for the actual wine bottle. NFT holders could also gain access to a special wine-tasting event.\nThe NFT provided a safe way to transparently verify relevant information about the wine bottles by leveraging the immutable nature of blockchain technology while also fostering wider promotional exposure for their wine label.\nRead more: Insights into how NFTs have transformed the premium spirits industry\nFormula 1 is a global sport, but many of its live sporting events come up with extremely high price tags, thereby making it cost-prohibitive for the average fan.\nFor popular brands and companies looking to create more accessibility for fans and consumers, NFTs can offer a modern technological vehicle that enables broader participation on a global scale with lesser marketing costs and more affordable access.\nHighly visible and established brands typically have a huge following with important historical dates and figures, company milestones, and other commemorative items. These can all be digitally represented as NFTs with unique artwork, be redeemable for access to company-related goods and services, and even traded in the secondary market.\nFor example, McLaren is no stranger to the world of digital collectibles and NFTs. In McLaren s case, they created a collection of NFTs that would commemorate each of the 23 races of a particular racing season. All NFTs would be given away for free during each race. Each collector would get:\nThe collection was a major success for Team McLaren, having issued them to over 600,000 NFT holders, and stirring up a lot of interest with both its core fan base as well as the NFT community.\nRead more: How pro sports is leveraging NFTs to engage with consumers\nCoupons and other discounts have always faced a problem where a potential consumer who wants to use a service may not have the proper ticket or coupon, while one who does may not want or need it.\nOne solution has been for the holder to sell it on a secondary market, but this also requires the need for verification and trust between the buyer and seller or the involvement of a third party to provide that trust for a fee.\nSome brands and marketing teams decide to take a shotgun approach, providing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of discounts, in the hopes that a small percentage of them will be redeemed, and write them off as a marketing cost.\nThis is where NFTs could provide a new potential solution by being transferable at little to no cost due to their digital nature with verification and transparency inherently provided through the usage of blockchain technology.\nAs noted in the examples above, NFTs are also tradable, enabling owners to sell them to others in an instant with complete transparency and authenticity through the usage of secondary markets and digital asset wallets.\nCorporate responsibility is a major consideration and priority for many brands and companies. However, initiatives such as raising money for charity can sometimes be tricky to promote and market effectively, especially when the goal is to raise as much money as possible.\nHere, NFTs can offer a potential solution, where the token provides transparent proof that a person or group contributed to a given charity and enables royalties from token resells to generate income for the designated charity.\nFor example, MAC Cosmetics is a global brand that decided to create an NFT collection to collect funds for Global HIV/AIDS Day.\nOnce a consumer adds the NFT to their wallet, 100 of primary NFT sales and 2.5 of secondary resales go to the M A C VIVA GLAM Fund and the Keith Haring Foundation, to support healthy futures and equal rights for youth living with or affected by HIV/AIDS.\nThis creates a market where donations can be generated over longer periods than the initial sale. The NFTs were divided into categories:\nThe collection sold completely, making it a very successful campaign to help with the HIV/AIDS epidemic and raise awareness in the process.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain to enable businesses and individuals to quickly create NFTs of various assets. Providing plug-and-play tools that do not require coding knowledge removes many of the technical barriers to getting started.\nAs an established go-to platform in the Cardano ecosystem, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets including e-books, diamonds, video game items, and more.\nIts products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support allow anyone to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and also offer traditional fiat payment options to mint their NFTs.\nWant to stay up-to-date on the latest business use cases for NFTs, such as real-world asset tokenization, DAOs, and more?\nFor more content, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "January 7, 2025\nEMURGO\nIntersect is a member-based organization (MBO) that plays an important role in supporting the Cardano community in governing the Cardano blockchain network. Along with blockchain governance, Intersect helps the community technically upgrade the network, onboard new members, and run other initiatives to achieve sustainable growth. By enabling its members to shape the future of the network, Cardano becomes the first truly decentralized and distributed blockchain entirely governed by its community.\nIntersect is an organization for its members and is run by its members. It has set up Committees, Working Groups, and other bodies to delegate responsibilities and key tasks needed to support distributed Cardano governance.\nEarlier this year, Intersect held elections for positions in its Committees and two new non-executive directors to join its Governing Board.\nIn this blog, we ll discuss how members are elected to Intersect s Committees and Board, two of its most central bodies, and how community members can get involved.\nThe Committees are designed to hold leadership elections once a year. Positions for the upcoming year were filled via the elections held in October and November of 2024. Next year, in 2025, there will be another round to replace the elected leaders.\nAs mentioned, Intersect is designed to be steered by its members so that the future of Cardano is community-led. The membership body provides this steering via Standing Committees, with community members taking an active role in participating in these bodies to influence the future of Cardano. According to Intersect, these committees act as decision-making and advisory bodies, providing direction and recommendations that reflect the community s will.\nThese Standing Committees cover the functional operations required to deliver continuity, provide steering direction to drafting the official Cardano Constitution, support internal membership, and more.\nA Standing Committee is expected to be a permanent fixture, although changes may be required as the Committees mature and the objectives evolve. The governing board will review proposed changes and support membership.\nWorking Groups typically form one of the initial seven Committees. These serve temporary functions that support a Committee s broader objectives or expand expertise by seeking contributions from outside Intersect. Working Groups can be formed on any necessary subject and are considered less formal than Standing Committees.\nMembers can receive more information about the different Committees and Working Groups by joining Intersect and their Discord channel.\nRelated reading:\nThe board at Intersect has a fiducial and regulatory responsibility to the organization. It is tasked with ensuring Intersect complies with all relevant regulations, including those of Wyoming state. The board serves in the best interests of Intersect members and is filled by Intersect members to achieve the organization s strategic vision and mission.\nThe Board of Directors manages Intersect s affairs. Directors do not need to be residents of the State of Wyoming but must be at least eighteen.\nThe Board of Directors consists of a maximum of 5 Directors. At all times, it shall have at least three 3 Directors. The Board of Directors, by majority vote, may establish a range for the size of the Board of Directors by fixing a minimum and maximum number of Directors, so long as the minimum number of Directors is at least three.\nRead more: Intersect Election FAQs\nBoth the Committees and Board have concluded their elections for the current term. These are meant to add members to the positions required to keep the organization going.

    "input": "",
    "output": "January 2, 2025\nEMURGO\nGaming and competitive e-sports have experienced rapid growth and adoption in recent years, turning into a multi-billion dollar industry that has attracted hundreds of millions of players and fans worldwide.\nWith high-speed Internet, gaming consoles, social media, and other related applications becoming even more readily accessible over the past couple of decades, it is no surprise that gaming has surged into the mainstream.\nNow, some gaming developers and interested eyes are turning to blockchain and Web3 to see how this emerging technology could integrate with both traditional games and video games to provide an enhanced player experience by leveraging its unique technological properties such as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\nNFTs enable highly sought-after and exclusive in-game items to be digitized and traded more easily. Since NFTs are recorded and issued on a decentralized blockchain, they can also provide transparent proof of transaction histories and other important information related to the item for anyone to verify. Gaming developers could opt to use NFTs for various promotional and user loyalty campaigns to provide exclusive access to limited edition goods and fan experience events. Payments for NFT transactions could also be streamlined and settled immediately using digital assets and supported crypto wallets, among other player benefits.\nAlthough blockchain-based games are still in their early days, more are now starting to be developed and played by users. In the Cardano gaming ecosystem, NMKR has been one of the catalysts for this growth by offering NFT minting tools for gaming developers to quickly get started with issuing NFTs for gameplay usage.\nIn this blog, let s review some of the blockchain games in the Cardano ecosystem using NMKR s technology.\nOne of the largest and longest-running games in the Cardano ecosystem, AdaQuest is an NFT-based RPG. It s a card game that utilizes Cardano NFTs to represent different battle cards and also allows them to be traded by their owners.\nPlayers can acquire these exclusive and limited artistic cards as NFTs, with each card having its own unique properties. By connecting with a player s Cardano web wallet to store the NFTs, they can then use these cards to play and compete against other players in the game.\nAdaQuest was among the first to adopt NMKR and its technology to issue their in-game NFTs and appeals to those interested in fantasy RPGs.\nRelated reading:\nMachiavellic is a Cardano NFT-based MMO that offers players an immersive gaming experience with a season-based model to organize gameplay. Each season, players must fight for resources that give out rewards and try to accumulate as much as possible before the end of the season.\nWithin the game, many things such as weapons, characters, armor, and rare collectibles are tradeable. Competitive events also offer top players opportunities to earn rare and unique NFTs that provide rewards simply for owning them. These also deliver significant gameplay value and further incentivize players.\nTo issue their NFTs, the game uses NMKR s NFT minting tools. Currently, the game is in its first season and players are collecting resources for the first time.\nTarochi is a 2D browser-based, on-chain RPG reminiscent of classic Pokemon. The concept is to look for cards of different monster characters which have distinct battle attributes. The cards are at the core of the game as they are not only the focus of the in-game play but also the trading side.\nPlayers can journey through an immersive land unlocking different achievements and quests.\nThe game s cards are also Cardano NFTs created using NMKR s technology. Each card represents one of the characters used for battle and that makes them tradable and important to its in-game economy.\nAdania is another battle card game launched on the Cardano network with a digital and physical version. In it, players face each other with decks of twelve cards each in a fast, competitive duel. There are 60 cards total and the game is played across a gameboard representing positions on a battlefield. Each card has unique attributes that ensure it can be used to counter other powers within the game.\nAs with other NFT-based games, the cards are represented as NFTs issued and recorded on the Cardano blockchain. To achieve this, Adania uses NMKR s minting tools.\nCardania is another battle-based MMO that launched on the Cardano network. Its gameplay revolves around factions that fight for in-game resources and digital tokens that can be used to acquire more territory within its gaming ecosystem. Players can cultivate lands, battle others, and unlock mysteries with the ability to be the sole owner of their rewards through NFTs.\nIt uses NMKR s NFT tools for Enter the Ultraverse, its trading card game with nearly 49,000 individual NFT trading cards from 9 different artists across various factions. In it, players have real ownership of their unopened packs and trading cards, allowing them to trade collectibles freely.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It allows businesses and individuals to quickly get started with issuing NFTs of assets by providing plug-and-play tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established go-to platform in the Cardano ecosystem, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets including e-books, diamonds, video games, and more.\nIts products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support enable anyone to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even offer traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nRead more: How to create a Cardano NFT using NMKR\nWant to learn more about various use cases for NFTs, such as real-world asset tokenization and gaming?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "May 29, 2024\nEMURGO\nDAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations have shown the potential to organize economic activity, allocate investments, fundraise, and other organizational functions in a more efficient way.\nLeveraging blockchain technology, DAOs are a new type of online-based human organization or entity that is self-running with its own set of rules and conditions.\nOver the past few years, the talks of and interest in DAOs have become more commonplace as blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have gained widespread attention in the news.\nYet, while blockchain and certain cryptocurrencies may be starting to be understood at a basic level by a technical and non-technical audience, the topic of DAOs is still relatively new.\nOne major obstacle to increasing its awareness has been the opaque or lack of regulatory frameworks surrounding DAOs and also the greater blockchain industry.\nThus, companies, developers, and individuals interested in forming a DAO tend to be reluctant to invest resources and time to build a DAO due to legal uncertainties.\nHowever, this tendency may be shifting as more governments are starting to embrace the expansion of blockchain-based Web3 technologies and services such as a DAO. In particular, Japan has introduced discussions on forming a framework for DAO integrations and has taken the first step among major nations to support its growth.\nThis blog will further discuss the basics of DAOs, their use cases, and how Japan is attempting to pave the way for commercial DAO adoption.\nA DAO is a type of online-based entity in which decision-making powers lie within a group of its members. In the DAO model, no central authority chooses how to allocate resources, distribute revenue, hire new personnel, etc.\nThe DAO makes these choices as a whole and then these are executed by the entire organization. As such, a DAO can represent the interests of the community and have the force of legitimacy since a majority of its members have approved its decisions.\nRead more: What are some DAO-related trends?\nTo achieve this vision, a DAO requires several pieces of Web3 or blockchain-based technologies:\nFor example, Yoroi is an open-source and self-custodial Cardano blockchain wallet that allows for all the crypto actions mentioned above and also interfaces with other Cardano-based DAO tools. This makes it a direct tool that a Cardano-based DAO and its members could use.\nOther pieces that are not required but useful to have include:\nRelated reading:\nSo, what is the potential of a DAO and its potential implications for businesses, organizations, and individuals?\nAs mentioned, a DAO is a new type of digital institution that can be used to organize human activities and be self-run with a set of blockchain-based digital tools at its disposal to ensure effectiveness. It takes decisions collectively through its members and decides how to best carry out activities to meet its objectives.\nIn many ways, it s like the cooperative model in which the workers of the organizations are also the owners and make decisions collectively when needed. The main difference is that a DAO opens this model on a global scale.\nCooperatives have problems scaling beyond their local regions because they don t provide a way for people to vote from all over the globe. They don t scale beyond their regional borders and are outcompeted by larger companies.\nA DAO can have the same, or even better, voting mechanisms than a cooperative and this can reach a global community. Anyone can become part of a DAO from anywhere via the instantaneous digital properties of blockchain technology.\nDigital tokens give voting power to every member and blockchain networks allow the members to track the resources of the DAO. The community not only chooses but also verifies the actions are being taken as per the original vote.\nThe transformative power of DAOs is already creating new ways for people to create self-run digital organizations. Some examples are:\nAs mentioned at the start, the legislation of most countries has been slow to adapt to the concept of a DAO due to a lack of awareness, political reasons, and other high-agenda items.\nHowever, Japan has been making moves to support the growth of Web3-related initiatives such as DAOs.\nRecently, Japan approved a new law that allows limited liability companies or LLCs to raise capital unlimitedly through an NFT (membership token) by deregulating the existing financial laws.\nAlso, Japan s DAO Association has been formed to promote the awareness, development, and implementation of DAOs nationwide. It will also act to safeguard users and organizations by filtering DAO projects and tools for legitimacy.\nIn the past, DAOs that operated in countries that did not recognize them ran the risk of running afoul of local laws and regulations.\nThis posed a major obstacle when it came to administrative business processes such as renting office space, accessing loans, raising money, hiring staff, or even paying taxes. DAOs had to try to use some existing laws, such as cooperatives, and try to adjust their legal status as best they could to operate legally.\nNow in Japan, there is potential for this new DAO-related law to:\nNew to DAOs or want to learn more about their potential?\nEMURGO is a global blockchain technology company with a focus on building blockchain infrastructure, providing blockchain education, and investing in Web3 companies.\nFollow EMURGO on X for more about DAOs and other Web3-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "September 7, 2021\nTogether Agency\nDownload Yoroi Wallet here\nOne of the reasons why cryptocurrencies are so powerful is that users have total ownership of their assets if kept off an exchange.\nA crypto wallet in reality only points to the record of the blockchain ledger that shows the coins and tokens owned by a person or user, and the wallet itself does not hold the crypto assets.\nOf course, this means each user is responsible for managing and securing their own cryptocurrencies.\nTo do so, many crypto wallets use a recovery key phrase, which is a series of random words that can be used to recover the private key of a wallet.\nIn some cases, a user forgets his/her spending password (separate from a recovery key phrase) and is locked out of their wallet, or needs to regenerate their wallet for another reason.\nThis is when knowing how to recover your crypto using a recovery key phrase is important.\nIn this blog, we will explain how to use the recovery key phrase to restore your funds on Yoroi Wallet a light wallet for Cardano ADA users.\nSince many recovery key phrases tend to be between 12 and 24 words, memorizing all of them can be a challenge.\nEspecially since the words need to be in the original order to work as a recovery mechanism.\nAs a reminder, do not:\nInstead, offline is the best way to do it:\nEMURGO a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain and developer of Yoroi Wallet receives many user questions on how to recover a Yoroi Wallet and has laid out the basic steps here to assist users.\nThe name and passwords do not have to be the same as the ones used before. If you have forgotten your password, this is the method to create a new one. In the recovery phrase square, you need to type each of the 15 or 24 words in the same order as shown the first time you created the wallet.\nAgain, it s important to mention that Yoroi Wallet doesn t store crypto assets. It only points to the record in the Cardano blockchain network that associates those assets with the wallet address. Only the distributed ledger of a blockchain records the ownership of the assets themselves. Yoroi only displays the key phrase when first creating the crypto wallet.\nIt is very important to keep it safe because if lost, there is no way to recover your wallet.\nThe time is now to integrate Yoroi with your preferred desktop web browser or mobile device.\nYoroi is an open-source light wallet for the Cardano community and ada holders.

    "output": "April 25, 2022\nEMURGO\nEMURGO Academy offers various online courses and webinars on blockchain education for students with both technical and non-technical backgrounds.\nCourses cover general and in-depth developer topics related to blockchain technology and Cardano.\nTaught by instructors with real-world practical experience in blockchain, EMURGO Academy s courses are an ideal fit for those seeking to learn the general basics of blockchain technology and for those looking to gain technical blockchain skills.\nBlockchain job opportunities have increased over the past few years as businesses and blockchain-based projects are looking for those with experience in blockchain development and knowledge to transition to a Web3 world of digital currencies, metaverse platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and more.\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) have been one of the most popular topics dominating the discussion around blockchain technology, and have brought many new users into the blockchain space.\nNFTs are mostly associated with digital art. However, due to the somewhat technical nature of NFTs, many people still do not fully understand what an NFT actually is.\nFor example, if anyone is able to simply right-click on the NFT to copy it, what value does it have?\nAll those misconceptions originate in the idea that the NFT is the visual asset attached to the token.\nIn short, an NFT is technically nothing more than an entry into the blockchain ledger that uses a unique identifier in the form of a cryptographic hash to make sure it cannot be duplicated.\nRegular fungible tokens do not have individual unique IDs, so they are interchangeable among each other. The NFT when recorded into the ledger comes with this unique identifier which permits its verification as a single entry into the recorded ledger or blockchain state.\nThe piece of artwork represented by the NFT can be an image, GIF, MP3, or even a video file.\nThe associated art is not present anywhere on the blockchain.\nIn fact, it would be prohibitively expensive to store large amounts of data on a decentralized network both in dollars and memory allocation. It is suboptimal, as the data would have to be copied thousands of times on nodes across the network while adding little to the usability of the token.\nThe artwork associated with the NFT is normally stored on a server providing this as a service.\nArtworks are referenced in the NFT via a link that points to the location where that piece of media is stored.\nFor NFTs, metadata is as crucial as the immutable blockchain ledger entry, and the external media, but often it gets overlooked in the discussion.\nBehind every NFT, there is the concept of metadata, which is a description of the attributes of the token that are independent from the entry on the ledger.\nMetadata is used by NFT marketplaces to show information about the token on their sites.\nThe metadata is pinned by returning it as a hash to the minting NFT smart contract.\nAn example of this metadata can look something like this:\n{ \"name\": \"Sleeping Cat\", \"description\": \"You opened the box and found a sleeping cat. Looking at it one cannot help but feel at peace.\", \"image\": \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeWK2BwtsEsSmRDMwmwCT5PADbyku2Xik5sXtsVQVC9Gw?filenam e=HE-SLEEP.jpeg\", \"attributes\": [ { \"trait-type\": \"EigenValue\", \"value\": \"HE SLEEPS\" } ] }\n{ \"name\": \"Sleeping Cat\", \"description\": \"You opened the box and found a sleeping cat.

This PolicyID is singular to each asset on Cardano.\nThe PolicyID originates from the minting script that defines properties of a token, such as who can mint, the supply, and others.\nNFTs are among the most dynamic assets in the blockchain industry.\nCardano has managed to implement their own version, the CNFT, by extending the unique properties of native assets.\nAs a result, CNFTs are more secure, easy to mint, and cheaper to use than other alternatives.\nEMURGO is uniquely positioned to leverage its extensive knowledge of Cardano s technical development to offer curated educational courses on Cardano to interested students.\nAll courses are taught by professional instructors with actual blockchain experience.\nEMURGO Academy, EMURGO s education unit, has now expanded to offer numerous courses on Cardano to a range of student types interested in becoming a Cardano developer, becoming a Cardano entrepreneur, becoming a Cardano business analyst/consultant, and more.\nFor more information on each of the courses and to contact a representative, please visit the link here now!\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "How NMKR Maximizes Brand Impact With Cardano NFTs EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 23, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe EMURGO and NMKR partnership was one of the biggest announcements from Cardano Summit 2023, which brought together two of the most well-known figures in the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.\nEMURGO s vision is to facilitate commercial growth of the Cardano ecosystem through dynamic partnerships, investments, education, and infrastructure development. NMKR has amassed a large following in the Cardano ecosystem through its mission to enable brands and users to easily issue NFTs and adopt Real-World Asset Tokenization on Cardano.\nIn this blog, we ll dive further into NMKR, its capabilities, and how brands and businesses can maximize their mainstream commercial impact by using NMKR s platform for NFTs and asset tokenization.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization service on Cardano that aims to bring Web3 to the masses through its simplicity. It s an easy-to-use application geared toward artists, brands, and web developers to allow them to create and sell Tokens or NFTs with as little friction as possible.\nThe platform uses an API architecture for its technical foundation. Anyone can use the API to mint Tokens or NFTs without requiring technical knowledge or any complex blockchain logic. It aims to be a user-friendly minimum code solution that broadens NFT adoption and brings more businesses and individual users into Cardano.\nThe current stats of NMKR are very impressive:\nThis makes NMKR one of the biggest decentralized applications and services on Cardano and a major player in the blockchain industry. It still has a lot more room for growth and is preparing to unveil some major products in the future to accelerate Cardano NFT and asset tokenization adoption.\nNMKR already offers a very complete and simple toolkit to issue NFTs. Let s go over some of the products NMKR currently offers, and discuss their utility, and benefits for those looking to start getting into NFTs.\nNMKR Studio is a platform for businesses & creators to launch & manage their own NFT & Tokenization projects. Examples include:\nBusinesses can issue NFTs for the reasons above, generate new revenue streams, and reach a new group of users interested in Web3.\nThe platform makes creating NFTs easy by enabling the uploading of images, configuring metadata, providing a payment option, and whitelisting wallet addresses.\nRelated Reading\nThe NMKR Studio API (Application Programming Interface) is a tool that integrates the functionalities of the NMKR Studio into web pages created by third parties. The API uses the HTTP Get and Post Requests and invokes NMKR s Server-Side code to run the minting logic.\nThe API brings all the power of NMKR Studio to the websites of those creating a project. All the tools created for NMKR Studio are then provided for the site of the project via the API. This allows for the seamless integration of Tokens and NFTs into any project without the need to have blockchain-specific developers on staff.\nAnother tool NMKR offers is a fiat payment solution to purchase NFTs. Most people don t have a cryptocurrency readily available when looking to make a purchase. This adds the hassle of having to access and create an account with a crypto exchange, deposit money, and turn it into a cryptocurrency. After, they would have to go back to the site that sells the NFTs and finally make the payment.\nAll these steps are streamlined with NMKR Pay, as it allows for direct fiat payments. In this way, the user can use their normal payment method and instantly buy the NFT from other users or brands. The steps are just reduced to a single one and the sale of NFTs is expedited.\nNMKR also provides the ability to set up royalty payments on NFT resales and can also be integrated with Airdrops, Holder Management & Secondary Sales API.\nCreators of the NFT collection can set up a payment wallet address where an amount of the resale price is deposited every time an NFT in the collection changes hands.\nThis can give a continuous revenue stream for a longer period. The money can be substantial when an NFT collection becomes popular and resales happen frequently. Another way projects can complement their income sources.\nThis has immense potential for individual creators and businesses with popular intellectual property they would like to tokenize.\nOn top of NMKR Studio as the underlying infrastructure, NMKR is currently building a Real-World Asset Tokenization Launchpad called finest.\nThis platform will allow users to easily invest in previously high-entry barrier asset classes like real estate, high-value art, and more.\nThe NMKR platform is a complete suite of tools for those looking to enter the NFT & Tokenization market. After describing all the things it has to offer, it s very easy to see how NMKR can fit in any strategy by a brand new to the blockchain space.\nThe great thing about NMKR is that it provides all the code to mint, make payments, and set up royalties for NFTs in an API form. Brands don t need to give up control over the visuals of the product as NMKR integrates seamlessly in the background without having to get blockchain developers.\nThe brand creators can focus on the feel, look, and utility of the NFT & Token collections allowing NMKR to run in the background without any worries. This makes NMKR one of the most versatile solutions for the NFT & Tokenization ecosystem on Cardano.\nAre you an EMURGO and NMKR follower?\nInterested in keeping up-to-date with the latest from EMURGO s partnership with NMKR?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to receive updates about the partnership and future initiatives with NMKR to drive Cardano NFT usage for asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Ways to Participate in Cardano Governance With Intersect EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "June 11, 2024\nEMURGO\nIntersect is a member-based organization (MBO) that supports Cardano s distributed community governance.\nLaunched in 2023, Intersect s objective is to transition the Cardano blockchain network towards a fully distributed governance structure whereby the community is responsible for the network s technical maintenance and sustainability.\nAnyone or any organization is eligible to join Intersect and help shape Cardano s governance and plans.\nWhile it is still early, Intersect is already an extensive organization with over 1,150 members.\nAs Cardano is in the process of shifting to this distributed governance model and has many ways to contribute, it is difficult for the average user or organization to start engaging with Cardano governance via Intersect.\nIn this blog, there is a short guide on five ways to get started with Intersect.\nRelated reading:\nThe first step is to join Intersect.\nMembers must register to start participating in Cardano governance. It s important to register as soon as possible, as there is a growing need for new members to join the conversation.\nRegistration also grants access to Intersect s Discord channel, the main channel for communication and discussion for members. An invitation is extended only once a person or organization has registered to join.\nOnce there, multiple channels, an event calendar, and other discussion threads are opened for the members. It s an integral part of the Intersect organization and the primary entryway for future activities.\nThe next step to engage more with Intersect is joining a Working Group.\nThese are groups of Cardano community members that join to discuss specific topics. Each Working Group is focused on one or two governance-related topics, so the discussion remains limited.\nThere are no requirements to join a Working Group. All of them are open to anyone who wants to join. Of course, some Working Groups are more technical, like the Developer Experience Working Group, while others focus on non-technical topics, such as the Marketing Working Group.\nThis means there is a Working Group for everyone in the community. Those with more technical skills will find a place in technology-minded groups, while those more interested in communications will have a place in the others.\nThe Working Groups are the backbone of Cardano s future. They discuss many important topics that will later shape the direction of the network, which is why being part of those discussions is crucial.\nOnce a month, Intersect holds a town hall open to all its members.\nIt s a chance to receive all the latest Cardano governance updates, learn which grants were awarded, attend future events, network, and receive other Intersect-related news.\nThe town hall also provides a chance to ask questions directly to the Intersect community and all members. Additionally, in the meeting, the members running the Working Groups often appear and present their latest work, asking for feedback and suggestions or even for new members to get involved.\nThe town hall is held remotely over a video conference so anyone can attend.\nAnother great way to participate in Intersect is to host events. Intersect members can provide help with information and other material to introduce Cardano to new entrants. It also helps with Intersect membership, as events are a great channel to get more members.\nEvents are also important to help spread the word about Cardano. The network will need new members to grow and become more self-sustaining. Intersect is focused on expanding Cardano adoption through broader awareness, decentralized applications, education for developers, and more.\nThe goal is for a large self-sustaining blockchain network with various decentralized applications, significant user adoption of these applications, various stakeholders securing the Cardano network, active governance participation, an increasing number of Cardano-proficient developers, enterprise adoption, etc.\nAnother important step is to apply for a grant. Many grants are available, and more will be launched later this year. A grant is a great way to be known by the greater Cardano community and help the network.\nGrants are not only technical; some address event organizing, education, and other topics. The grants are given in ada, so some risk management is necessary when planning to finish one.\nWant to receive more information about Cardano governance and Intersect?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

This test network aims to comprehensively implement the CIP-1694 specifications in a simulation environment.\nSanchoNet GovTool: This is a website that allows the Cardano Community the chance to experience now some of the governance features described in CIP-1694.\nCIP-1694: It s a set of governance guidelines that came as a result of a series of global workshops organized by the Intersect MBO.\nSanchoNet s main focus is to build and introduce governance mechanisms and feedback from Cardano s CIP-1694 into a controlled testnet environment. It serves as the backbone of the Cardano community regarding the experimental implementations of Cardano s on-chain governance activities taking place right now and in the future.\nThe use of SanchoNet to test Cardano s community governance is not only a technical proposition but also one that requires a lot of work off-chain such as technical committees, informational tools, information localization, education, and more. SanchoNet is a truly collaborative effort between Cardano s off-chain aspects and its on-chain technical requirements to achieve community-run governance.\nFor this reason, SanchoNet is meant to be a testbed network for the governance requirements of Cardano. As more discussions and workshops are held and more community feedback is received, it will change as new community needs for governance are identified. Cardano itself as a network is constantly going through updates and new technical developments, many of which need to be considered as part of its governance model.\nThere are different actors in Cardano s governance, including the stake pool operators (SPOs), delegate representatives (DReps), the Constitutional Committee, and ADA holders. All of them can test its developing governance model at a technical level. The community will be able to see how these tools are being implemented in a test phase.\nAs such, much of the success of building Cardano s governance framework and SanchoNet depends on the feedback and involvement of the Cardano community.\nRelated reading:\nThe SanchoNet allows for the testing of various roles that are fulfilled by people and organizations in the Cardano community. Each has a crucial part to play in shaping the future of Cardano governance and the evolution of the Voltaire era. Some of these main roles are:\nTest-ada holders: SanchoNet is a test network, so it utilizes test-ADA. The holders of this type of ADA are the ones crafting and submitting governance actions. These holders are the engine that proposes the changes the other actors must consider.\nSPOs: SPOs need to register specifically to the SanchoNet test network and are the ones that vote using delegation to stake pools. The SPOs vote with the test-ADA delegated to test the voting mechanism of Stake Pool Operators.\nDReps: DReps aggregate the decision-making of the network by having test-ADA holders give their balance and voting power to a DRep. By exercising the right to vote with their accumulated test-ADA, the DReps approve or reject governance proposals.\nDevelopers: SanchoNet is not a fully realized test network. The project still requires a lot of work and here is where developers can aid. These are a group of individuals who create wallets, blockchain explorers, and other tools that connect to SanchoNet.\nThe team behind SanchoNet has created a portal for those looking to simulate the governance of Cardano, but don t have the technical expertise to connect to SanchoNet. The portal offers roles for ADA holders, DReps, and for creating governance actions.\nThe website for the portal is https://sanchogov.tools/. In it, Cardano users can:\nRead more: What is SanchoNet GovTool?\nThe portal simulates the experience of participating in the governance model outlined in CIP-1694. It remains an evolving tool that with time it ll be able to offer more opportunities to test the concepts outlined in the governance model of Cardano.\nThe SanchoNet test network is being deployed in stages that each increase functionalities to the Cardano ecosystem. Some of them are already live, while the rest are coming shortly. Let s review these stages:\nPhase 1: SanchoNet opens itself to users and opens to submit new constitutional governance actions and for SPOs to vote on these actions.\nPhase 2: Focused on increasing community participation by enabling test-ADA holders to register as DReps, delegate voting power to other DReps, review governance actions, and vote as DReps.\nPhase 3: Expands the submission and voting of governance actions and increases information about them.\nPhase 4: Introduces the Constitutional Committee and its different states such as motion of no-confidence and treasury withdrawal actions. At this point, it will be possible to elect Constitutional Committee members.\nPhase 5: Allows governance actions to dictate protocol parameter updates. This dramatically changes the power of governance.\nPhase 6: Opens the governance actions to be the initiators of a hard fork for the network.\nPhases 1 through 4 are live on the SanchoNet test network. The rest are expected to happen shortly and be ready for the broader governance discussions.\nFollow EMURGO on X\nAre you looking for a simple way to receive Cardano governance updates and more about the Cardano ecosystem?\nThen, click above and follow EMURGO on X.\nEMURGO is a global technology company with a mission to facilitate commercial adoption of the Cardano blockchain through partnerships with existing ecosystem partners and new entrants to Web3.\nBy prioritizing investments, delivering continuous education, and building infrastructure, EMURGO s goal is to unlock the full potential of the Cardano ecosystem.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "input": "",
    "output": "June 1, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nWith the Cardano blockchain having grown its ecosystem of users and applications over the past several years, the focus has now shifted to Cardano s decentralized governance policies to ensure its future sustainability.\nAs a decentralized blockchain, Cardano was meant to always eventually be governed by its community.\nCIP-1694 is a discussion proposal that represents the first concerted effort in delivering on this promise. It plays a crucial role in shaping the future of Cardano and brings another major upgrade for the Cardano community.\nLet s review all you need to know about CIP-1694 and what it means for the Cardano community.\nCIP-1694 is a specific Cardano Improvement Proposal. It is a formal document from the Cardano community that contains specifications and organizational notes about topics related to on-chain governance for Cardano including Cardano native tokens, new standards for on-chain improvements, and any changes proposed for the Cardano protocol, among others.\nIt follows a previous system from the internet called a Request for Comment (RFC). The process starts with an initial draft. It can be created by a single individual, a small group, or a large organization. The draft document is taken by the Cardano community to review, improve, and then revise for any mistakes or to make it more complete. Anyone in the world can volunteer to read up on draft CIPs. Some topics are technical and require blockchain knowledge; others are community proposals.\nThose who volunteer to review CIPs meet bi-weekly and publish summaries of all discussions in a dedicated GitHub.\nThe meetings happen on a Discord server that anyone can join via this invite.\nFinally, the meetings are recorded and also published on a YouTube channel maintained by the Cardano Foundation.\nThe entire process is meant to be as inclusive and transparent as possible for anyone in the Cardano community to participate. The CIPs are the most direct way for an ordinary Cardano community member to contribute to the future of the Cardano blockchain and get involved with others in the community.\nOne of the CIPs attracting the most attention at the moment is CIP-1694 and its implications for the Voltaire era of Cardano, the final development period.\nCIP-1694 was named after the birth year of Voltaire, and it is the main focal point around the start of Cardano s Voltaire era. This means that CIP-1694 will start to form the governing bodies of the Cardano protocol including a Constitutional Committee, Delegated Representatives (dReps), and SPOs, and create voting policies and other governance details about Cardano.\nThe governance mechanism will be introduced in stages and then gradually become more complex. Not all of the decisions regarding Cardano will immediately be given to the community, and the process will take time to fully finish.\nAlso, at the moment, the proposal is very much experimental and is subject to many debates and discussions from the various stakeholders in the Cardano community including developers, holders, academics, stake pool operators, and others.\nThe governance of a decentralized protocol such as Cardano has never been attempted in this scope and thus, there are many things to discuss regarding how the pieces will work together.\nFor this reason, the governance rollup will be an iterative process. In it, changes introduced will first be on a trial basis. After, there will be a period of study and interpretation to see how the changes are performed at the Cardano protocol level.\nThis careful approach will ensure the Cardano community, developers, projects, and other stakeholders have enough time to adjust. Also, it will allow the Cardano ecosystem to correct any ideas that didn t work as expected or implement other changes that were suggested during the trial.\nThe first body to oversee the governance of Cardano will be called the Constitutional Committee. It ll ensure that the Cardano Constitution is followed and that it is updated according to a process.\nThe Cardano Constitution itself is still in the discussion stage. There is no official published document for it, but it ll become the foundation of all future Cardano governance decisions and the main item used as the foundation of the Voltaire era.\nThere was a pilot CIP-1694 workshop held in March 2023 in Colorado, USA and there are more CIP-1694 workshops planned throughout the year. Some workshop dates have been announced including ones in Tokyo, Japan; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Zug, Switzerland that will be hosted by EMURGO, IOG, and CF.\nCIP-1694 aims to give every Cardano community member a say in the future direction of Cardano. The Cardano Constitution will be the foundational document, and every member will be able to show their preferences by voting on-chain. This way, the Cardano community will be involved in the decisions that shape Cardano s future.\nAdditionally, there will be several roles open for governance. There will be membership to the Constitutional Committee and to the Delegated Representatives (DReps) which will be aggregators of voting power and ultimately be able to cast votes. Finally, Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) are one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions by voting.\nThese roles will be the way people can take charge of the Cardano network. People from all over the globe can become Committee members or DReps.\nOnce CIP-1694 is confirmed and running, Cardano will be in the hands of the community. This means the Constitution Committee, Dreps, SPOs, and other community members. Collectively, all of them will be able to make proposals, have them be presented for a vote, and if successful be implemented.\nThe Cardano network will become the first decentralized blockchain protocol controlled and run by its community which will be significant.\nThe vision for a decentralized ecosystem running on open-source blockchain technology and governed by its community will become a reality.\nWorking closely with Cardano ecosystem partners and projects, EMURGO is committed to the development of the Cardano ecosystem for the global community.\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "An Introduction to Liquid Democracy in Cardano EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "July 6, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nDemocracy has been the model governance system in the West for around three centuries. There are different types of democracy including Liquid Democracy. Democracy is among the most successful governance systems in human history and remains, in many parts of the planet, the standard in free, developed societies. It enables people to express their opinions and be a part of the decision-making process in the communities and countries they are a part of.\nIn this context, it seems natural that decentralized blockchain networks with their large number of users, should also adopt democratic principles. As a blockchain network grows, governance and the proper allocation of network resources become a priority to ensure fairness, transparency, and sustainability as a decentralized blockchain is run by its users.\nSo it begs the question:\nIs democracy truly the best system for a decentralized blockchain?\nIn this blog, we ll discuss this question and its implications.\nA deceptively simple question at first, democracy is one of the most studied systems on the planet. There are whole books devoted to its understanding, countless lectures, and entire university specializations centered around this topic.\nFor this reason, it would not be possible to make an exhaustive presentation of what is democracy in the confines of a single basic article. The subject will have to remain on a general level that discusses democracy at large and not the many variations that exist today.\nRegardless, we can still conclude why liquid democracy is being considered for the governance of the Cardano blockchain.\nPlus, we can discuss the criticisms of how democracies operate in the current world.\nA dictionary definition of democracy would be:\na system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. (Powered by Oxford Languages)\nWe can see that there are two different types of democracy in its simplest dictionary definition. One where the people of a State govern directly, or one where representatives make decisions: Direct Democracy or Representative Democracy.\nDirect Democracy was adopted by the relatively small city-states of Greece with Athens as the most famous of the group.\nIn a Direct Democracy, the citizens of the political unit gather in a location and discuss the subjects at hand. There is a vote to decide any matter which then is chosen directly with no intermediation by proxy agents.\nThere are debates before the vote, where opposing factions can elaborate on the merits of their positions. Oratory is one of the most valued skills in such a system, as explaining the subject of the vote convincingly was crucial for success.\nDirect democracies tend to be suited for small political institutions as it requires direct participation by those who are deemed as part of the system and are more likely suited for smaller groups of people.\nBecause it requires direct debate and voting, direct democracy is not feasible in many modern societies with large populations. This is what gave rise to our next example, Representative Democracy.\nRepresentative Democracy is founded on the idea that individuals cannot decide directly and choose representatives to govern for them. The representatives are separated into different governing bodies and these have term limits.\nAgain, Representative Democracy is a complex topic that can t be explained in a short article. But, the most important feature of it can be discussed and used to unravel its implications. In this case, society as a whole, is governed by a small group of elected officials.\nAs a decentralized network is composed of many participants with larger blockchain ecosystems having millions of users, Direct Democracy seems impossible.\nFurthermore, Representative Democracy appears to fit more appropriately to the task at hand and should be adopted.\nBut we know there are many problems with it and perhaps it is not suited for this new type of organization, a decentralized blockchain network.\nThe critics of Representative Democracy are numerous and varied. Many aspects can be put into question, and scholars from all over the world do it in their collective works.\nIn this blog, we ll focus on one problem with the ideas of representation which comes from the world of Game Theory The Principal-Agent.\nThe principal-agent problem is a conflict in priorities between the owner of an asset and the person to whom control of the asset has been delegated. [1]\nIn the case of a Representative Democracy, the elected officials are the agent while the electorate is the principal. At first, it seems their best interest is to govern on behalf of the electorate. Yet, their position allows them to accumulate more information and resources by acting against the general interest or the people that directly elected them.\nFurthermore, the period where they can be made accountable, an election, is very short and happens after long intervals. For this reason, once a representative is chosen and becomes part of the government, his/her incentives to fulfill promises drop dramatically.\nThe mismatch between the electorate and the elected only grows over time, especially if there are no term limits for the officials. The result is corruption and a disenchanted society that no longer trusts the system.\nThe Principal-Agent Problem in Representative Democracies is one of great complexity. There are many discussions about how deeply it affects a society, or even if it can be used as an analytic tool.\nBut to govern a decentralized blockchain, there might be a different choice altogether.\nAlso known as a Delegate Democracy in certain literature, it s a new type of democracy where citizens are permitted to share their votes and support specific policies rather than having to rely fully on representatives that are subject to other interests. By moving around their allocated power, citizens in this system can directly impact policies. It s sometimes called Delegate Democracy because the power rests more in the hands of the delegates rather than on representatives.\nIn this type of system, delegates are repositories of voting power. The moment they cast their vote, they do it with the assigned voting power and do it on a case-by-case basis. In one instance, some representatives may have expertise in infrastructure, so citizens delegate more voting power to them, and trust their knowledge.\nOn other matters that require different expertise, such as social policy, other delegates might be more suited, and the citizens move their power accordingly. In a way, the delegates voting power is mutable and changes and adapts to circumstances.\nWith this system, the Principal-Agent Problem is reduced since at any point a delegate can lose all of their voting power if the citizens perceive a poor performance. In a way, Liquid Democracy has elements of Direct Democracy, as citizens directly impact how voting power migrates, and also Representative Democracy as the delegates vote according to their expertise.\nIt marries both concepts and leverages decentralized blockchain technology to make it all happen. For this reason, the Cardano blockchain has taken on Liquid Democracy as the system chosen to govern Cardano for this precise reason.\nIt s both adaptive and representative and marks a true departure from previous systems of government. In Cardano, liquid democracy is a pillar of the Voltaire era. It focuses on decentralized on-chain governance of the Cardano blockchain by its community of developers, academics, organizations, stake pool operators, and other individuals.\nIn an upcoming blog, we ll dive deeper into the Liquid Democracy design for Cardano and also discuss the different subsystems and the process to roll it out onto the network.\nEMURGO supports the adoption of Cardano and blockchain technologies by building Web3 solutions on Cardano, educating blockchain developers, investing in blockchain startups, and informing Cardano enthusiasts on the latest developments in the Cardano ecosystem.\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Explaining the Bodies in Cardano Governance EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "July 11, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nIn a previous blog, we covered the basics of the concept of Liquid Democracy in Cardano blockchain governance.\nIn this blog, we ll elaborate more on how the Cardano blockchain has set up roles for the Constitutional Committee, Delegated Representatives (DReps), and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) to integrate Liquid Democracy and its advantages for on-chain decentralized governance.\nFirst, we have to keep in mind that decentralized governance is a new experiment and is being developed with the input of the community.\nIt has not been attempted at the scale of a system like Cardano with its millions of global users and there are no real case studies.\nFor these reasons, all the details presented here are subject to change as more discussion continues within the Cardano community in its Voltaire era.\nAs the realities of Liquid Democracy applied to a decentralized blockchain like Cardano become more apparent, adjustments will be made along the way to continuously upgrade governance mechanisms.\nIt s important to keep in mind that this is just the starting point and that the future goal is to have a smoothly-run governance structure of Cardano that is decentralized and accessible to everyone.\nThe outlines of the Liquid Democracy model are being discussed worldwide in the CIP-1694 workshops. The results will shape the first iteration of what will be the first decentralized government model for a blockchain, especially one of Cardano s scale.\nIn the current model, there are already some institutions outlined that will become the backbone of the Liquid Democracy system.\nThe objective is to focus on two of them and give more details on their inner workings while we also briefly look at the SPOs (Stake Pool Operators).\nThese two governing bodies we ll describe are accessible to anyone in the Cardano community. Their power and legitimacy come from the fact that they are completely open. They will be in charge of much of the operations of the government and also direct the future of the governance model.\nTheir roles are extremely important and a lot rests on the shoulders of both these institutions. The name of the two bodies is the Constitutional Committee and the Delegated Representatives (DReps). Let s unpack them both.\nIn short, the Constitutional Committee is defined in the current CIP-1694 document as a committee which represents a set of individuals or entities that are collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitution is respected.\nThe Cardano Constitution is being discussed to become the document that will guide the governing principles for the Cardano network. At the moment, there are only drafts of it and it s very much under discussion, but once there is an established document, the Constitutional Committee will be in charge of enforcing its principles.\nThe members of the Constitutional Committee have to vote on any decision that affects governance and decide if it goes against the Constitution. It cannot create new initiatives, nor as of its current design, modify the once presented for a vote.\nThe Committee decides whether a proposal goes against the Cardano Constitution. It s a binary vote, which is meant to preserve the rule of the Constitution over the entire network.\nThe Constitutional Committee will be instituted initially for the first interaction with members of the Cardano community and then it ll change as the governance model advances.\nThe number of members has not yet been decided. It s expected that the number will change over time and be any non-negative number. At some points, there may be more members than at a previous stage. So, the committee won t ever have a fixed number of participants.\nThe members also don t have to be only individuals. It s expected that some members will represent whole entities that are corporations, groups, or other forms of collective institutions that support the Cardano network.\nThe Constitutional Committee can be considered as having two states: a normal state and a state of no-confidence. In the first one, it means the committee is working as expected and it s operating normally.\nThe second state signals that it has lost the backing of the community and must be replaced.\nThe other two governing bodies of Cardano, the DReps and the SPO Council, are the ones that determine if the Constitutional Committee is in a state of no-confidence.\nThe threshold of the vote required by the other two bodies has not yet been decided. The result of the vote can be the complete or partial replacement of the Constitutional Committee.\nThe Constitutional Committee won t have periodic elections. This means that the individual committee members will each have different expirations for their mandates. The members will each be replaced once their terms are concluded and this can happen many times during a year.\nAs of now, the new members have to be voted by the SPOs and the DReps to be confirmed to the Constitutional Committee. The threshold has not been decided, nor what is the nominations procedure for new members.\nDelegated Representatives are registered members of the Cardano community who can receive the delegation of voting power. Individuals have voting power by the amount of ADA each control. These can be delegated to a registered DRep and used as voting power as well.\nEach DRep votes with all the ADA delegated to them when deciding on the proposals up for a vote. The ADA can be migrated from DRep to DRep at any point, or broken down and one person can delegate portions of their ADA to different DReps.\nIn the same way, ADA delegated to a pool is not transferred, ADA delegated to a DReps does not change ownership. The ADA always remains in control of the original individual.\nAny member of the Cardano community can register and receive a DRep ID. This means they can receive the delegation of the ADA holders. Registration is the only requirement to become a DRep and what determines the influence of any one DRep is how much voting power is accumulated by them.\nThis means there is no set number of DReps although details are subject to discussion. At any point, the number of active DReps can increase or decrease, as ADA holders migrate their voting power from different representatives.\nAgain, there are no term limits for the DReps. An active DRep has a non-negative amount of voting power and is voting on different proposals. The non-active ones are those who retire their DRep ID and no longer accept voting power delegation. Finally, there can be unsuccessful DReps who have an active ID but no voting power.\nAs voting power migrates and is delegated to different DReps. In some cases, a single DRep can see all the voting power moved to another DRep for a while. The DReps are a flexible body of representatives that are meant to adjust to the needs of the network.\nFinally, we have the SPOs or Stake Pool Operators. They are the second voting block on the Liquid Democracy model. They use the ADA delegated to their pool as voting power and use it to choose among any proposals under consideration.\nAnyone who has an active stake pool on Cardano can vote, but it s possible to abstain. The number of SPOs and the amount of ADA delegated to them is the voting power of this institution.\nFor now, those are the different institutions meant to take up the governance of Cardano. Each of the three bodies is meant to balance the other and give a voice to the ADA holders as a whole.\nAs we said at the start, the current model is very much in the early stages of planning. The CIP-1694 workshops are collecting feedback from all over the world and once the first cycle is over, much of this design will be modified.\nThe road to a fully self-governed Cardano network is a long one. Each step must be carefully considered and enough information has to be gathered to make changes. This journey we ll be a rewarding one and the entire community must participate to make it successful.\nEMURGO supports the adoption of Cardano and blockchain technologies by building Web3 solutions on Cardano, educating blockchain developers, investing in blockchain startups, and informing Cardano enthusiasts on the latest developments in the Cardano ecosystem.\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "What You Need to Know About Cardanos Voltaire Era?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "May 25, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nThe Cardano blockchain is one of the largest open-source and decentralized blockchain networks in crypto with a huge global community. Cardano has evolved from its inception by going through many technical upgrades to now being on the cusp of getting handed over to the community for governance moving forward.\nWith so much distributed development happening in Cardano including DeFi protocols, wallets, NFT dApps, stablecoins, and more, the global Cardano community is starting to address decentralized blockchain governance policies with the support of Cardano founding entities EMURGO, IOG, and The Cardano Foundation. These policies will settle Cardano voting policies, procedures, and other governance details for ADA holders.\nDecentralized blockchain networks ultimately aim to be democratic and community-run with its members deciding voting policies and procedures that affect how it is run in the future.\nThis naturally leads to the question of:\nhow to effectively govern such a massive decentralized global network with millions of users and thousands of running applications?\nThis is the key question that Cardano s Voltaire era, the final era in its roadmap, aims to answer.\nBelow, we will address this key question and further details you need to know about Cardano and Voltaire.\nCardano is an open-source decentralized blockchain and is the first blockchain to be designed and built according to scientific methods. It also uses an environmentally friendly proof-of-stake consensus protocol to power and secure its distributed network which consumes much less energy than other networks. The entire Cardano blockchain is around 60,000 times less energy intensive than Bitcoin [1].\nBy using programmable smart contracts, Cardano is not only able to validate transactions between people but also, self-executing contracts that process once programmed conditions are met. This means that certain financial products, for example, can be easily and securely launched using smart contracts.\nThe Cardano blockchain aims to be a scalable, interoperable, and sustainable blockchain that provides accessible economic services to all by being a platform that hosts decentralized applications for finance, digital property, identity, records, and more. It is scalable to be able to process a large number of transactions, interoperable with other blockchains and data systems, and sustainable for generations through robust governance policies.\nCardano s innovative proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called Ouroboros powers its decentralized blockchain that provides users with low transaction fees with fast settlement times, a sustainable economic model, and the ability to scale and evolve with users having more control over the future of the network.\nWith this unique emphasis on scalability, interoperability, and sustainability using scientific peer-review methods to engineer Cardano, the ecosystem has been growing exponentially since its launch in September 2017 with millions of users worldwide.\nWith the technical foundation set for Cardano, the final topic for the Cardano community to address is decentralized governance.\nVoltaire is the final building era of the Cardano roadmap. From the beginning, Cardano s development has been divided into several eras with each focusing on a different part of its technology. The Voltaire era deals with its governance by the community.\nIt is important to note that the development eras of Cardano are not happening in sequential order, but are happening in parallel due.\nCardano smart contracts, for example, were introduced as part of the previous Goguen era, but improvements and other optimizations to them are still ongoing.\nThe first steps in the discussion about Cardano s future governance are underway with the community as the focus with support from EMURGO, IOG, and Cardano Foundation. As governance details will also influence the future direction of Cardano smart contracts, scalability solutions, side chains, and other solutions, the community must be involved.\nThe two main aspects that Voltaire and Cardano s governance aims to address are voting and treasury systems.\nVoting is to ensure that the correct priorities are chosen by the community. The treasury systems deal with how to manage the financial resources of the Cardano network.\nThere will be three pillars in Cardano governance:\nGovernance is a critical piece of any community-based system. Most of the crises we have today have to do with failures in effective governance systems from deadlocks in legislatures, corporate corruption, economic instability, and more. Many of these are caused by poor governance systems.\nThis impact of bad governance systems has also previously been felt by the blockchain industry. One of the most important early community governance failures was the fight for the data size of a Bitcoin block. One side wanted to update the block size to about 5 megabytes to account for the increased use of the Bitcoin network. The other wanted to maintain the original 1-megabyte space and do some workarounds to fit more transactions.\nIn the end, neither side could convince the other, and the Bitcoin network was divided into two different blockchains Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Other forked versions came later which goes back to the idea of sustainability. Cardano is designed to prevent these sustainability issues by coming up with a fair governance system to last generations for a large user base.\nThus, Voltaire is critical to make the Cardano network a sustainable project by creating a dialogue with different stakeholders including ADA holders, Cardano developers, SPOs, and others. As more projects continue to launch on Cardano, many start having different priorities regarding which technologies to deliver first, where to allocate grants, which market to focus on, and many more.\nA proper governance system will help to allocate resources efficiently by revealing the preferences of the participants.\nVoltaire is addressing these points and starts the discussion on how to best deliver a representative system for an international network that can have millions of users.\nBy now you may have realized how crucial the Voltaire era is for the future sustainability of Cardano. Many projects stumble when they try to incorporate community input and that leads to alienation and conflict inside the ecosystem.\nOnce Voltaire is in motion, the Cardano community will go from a passive watcher to an active entity when it comes to decision-making and steering of Cardano as a whole. The network will have a first-of-its-kind blockchain constitution meant to transparently and fairly rule over a decentralized network of community members.\nTo communicate directly with the community, EMURGO will be hosting an in-person Voltaire workshop in Tokyo, Japan in June 2023 along with support from IOG to discuss Cardano governance\nRead more: All you need to know about the Tokyo Voltaire workshop\nEMURGO is a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain and builds Web3 solutions on Cardano, educates aspiring Cardano developers, invests in startups building on Cardano, and informs Cardano enthusiasts on the latest developments in the Cardano ecosystem.\nWorking closely with Cardano ecosystem partners, EMURGO is committed to the development of the Cardano ecosystem for the global community.\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "output": "December 27, 2024\nEMURGO\nConsumers are much more familiar with NFTs (non-fungible tokens) these days, which has spurred companies and brands to develop ways to increase business growth by utilizing them.\nTo date, NFTs have mostly been embraced by the highly valued young adult (ages 18-34) demographic, and businesses are becoming interested in or already tinkering with using NFTs in their marketing strategies to better reach their customers directly and offer a unique, digital experience.\nWith this consumer demographic familiar with the latest technologies, such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies, NFTs are quickly emerging as a valuable tool for standing out from the competition.\nA digital token that is created and recorded on a decentralized blockchain network, NFTs can digitally represent brand assets and be used in a variety of ways by their issuers to provide a more efficient, and new personalized consumer experience.\nIn this blog, we ll discuss 5 reasons why major global companies and brands have or are experimenting with NFTs and examples of their implementations.\nCompanies are always searching for ways to onboard more consumers, promote brand awareness, and ultimately drive business growth.\nTo do this, brands have engaged in traditional marketing campaigns ranging from celebrity endorsements to product placement advertisements in print and digital media and live events, among a host of other initiatives.\nIn today s rapidly expanding digital landscape, NFTs now bring the potential to offer new and unique consumer experiences, including rewards such as exclusive access to events or limited edition goods for holders. The NFT holders could also choose to trade these tokens to others who may be interested. The NFTs also contain verifiable proof of ownership history and other relevant information in the token metadata to enhance transparency.\nSince NFTs are digital assets that can be created and distributed instantaneously by companies for a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns, they hold immense potential to reach new and existing customers.\nPayments for the NFTs could also be settled quickly through the usage of supported cryptocurrency wallets.\nBrands could also work with savvy influencers to reach early adopter consumers who can create network effects for NFTs. Over the long run, this kind of NFT campaign could strengthen brand awareness, consumer loyalty, and engagement if done effectively.\nFor example, Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) Beauty launched its NFT debut with 10,000 exclusive YSL Beauty Golden Blocks. These were 3D blocks on a white background and quickly became a collectible with them all being claimed within 48 hours. Each one of these NFT collectibles opened the door for the brand to start building its own exclusive Web3 community.\nThe iconic company then launched a new NFT collection to honor its fragrance line Black Opium. These NFTs were gifted to those who purchased one of its limited physical Black Opium fragrances from the company s website.\nIn total, the company has launched four NFT collections to date, with one selling nearly 1.3 million tokens in seven days to more than 24,000 people.\nRelated reading:\nCompanies also regularly develop and launch new services such as customer programs to target new areas for business growth, gain consumer insights, or reward loyalty.\nNFTs can be used to experiment with these sorts of programs to resonate with younger entrepreneurs and consumers. For instance, loyal consumers with a transaction history could get first access to certain NFT collection launches or be rewarded with NFTs that can then be redeemed for exclusive physical items or in-person experiences.\nAs mentioned above, these NFTs could also be traded globally to other interested buyers.\nIn one example, Visa launched a one-year Visa NFT Creator Program for young digital creators in art, music, fashion, and film who want to accelerate their small businesses through NFTs. This initiative was planned to enable the company to follow the future of commerce.\nThe program helps these creators access new entrepreneurship strategies in distributing their content using NFTs and experiment with integrating the usage of various traditional and digital asset payment options while allowing Visa to forge connections with young up-and-coming digital entrepreneurs and gain NFT market insights.\nNFTs can also be used to drum up further interest and excitement with their passionate consumers through an exclusive NFT drop.\nFor instance, Lamborghini, a luxury sports car manufacturer, has long been popular and well-known within the cryptocurrency community.\nWith this knowledge in hand, the brand launched an NFT sale that lasted for eight months in 2023. According to their site, the NFTs will be released in a string of monthly collections of four pieces over four days. Each piece will only remain available to be purchased for 24 hours after the unveiling. Each month will feature three NFTs plus a unique limited-edition piece. A super-exclusive NFT will be waiting for those who collect all monthly releases.\nWith many of their consumers and those interested in the brand familiar with cryptocurrencies and NFTs, Lamborghini was able to further connect and engage with a community to forge deeper connections and build more interest in their brand.\nRead more: How NFTs can boost the sports and entertainment industries\nThe metaverse refers to a virtual world made up of 3D technology, blockchain-based products & services, and other emerging technologies, with users interacting with each other and known brands through avatars. It enables humans to enter into a digital playground to socialize, learn, and collaborate more easily than one might in the physical world.\nNFTs can be used in a metaverse to digitally represent items that are limited or high in demand. Brands can use them to entice users to enter their metaverse, buy and collect them, or even make them redeemable for physical items. Curious users will be more likely to register for the metaverse and start experimenting or collecting these NFT collectibles to store or trade them. Metaverse participants can also be given exclusive access to other brand rewards or limited edition products to incentivize registration.\nAs the metaverse is completely digital, a company can try out new marketing ideas and campaigns they would normally try in a physical store for a much lesser cost. By being digital, creativity and innovation can be further unlocked. Incorporating 3D technology, NFTs, and other technologies also helps to make NFTs and the metaverse a unique and cool experience for a younger audience.\nIn one example, Adidas Originals, a lifestyle brand and subdivision of the popular athletic apparel and footwear company, launched an NFT collection entitled Into the Metaverse, a collection of 30,000 digital collectibles that grants holders access to exclusive physical merchandise along with other digital rewards.\nEach company or brand has its own set of values it prioritizes and promotes to its consumers. For instance, a lifestyle brand might promote a certain set of values and the image they would like to evoke while an environmental-friendly brand might promote a different set of values.\nNFTs can also play a role in supporting the promotion of a brand s values by encouraging their consumers to align.\nTo demonstrate, Starbucks Korea launched an NFT campaign to reduce demand for single-use cups and promote its environmental initiative earlier this year. According to the company, it saved around 600,000 single-use cups within two weeks since launching the service with 260,000 customers participating. For the campaign, Starbucks Korea offered their special NFTs through three different reward missions. Each time a customer ordered and chose to use a personal tumbler was given an eco-stamp which could be exchanged for different NFT types depending on the number of stamps.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It allows businesses and individuals to create NFTs by providing tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established platform, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets.\nIts various products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support enable businesses and individuals to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even provide traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nInterested in receiving more information on business use cases for NFTs, such as real-world asset tokenization and marketing strategies?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Aiken, a New Way to Build dApps on Cardano EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "July 10, 2024\nEMURGO\nLearn to use a powerful, fast, and easy language to build dApps on Cardano.\nOne of the most important innovations from blockchain technology has been the decentralized application or dApp.\nIt created a new way to provide accessible products and services through the usage of programmable smart contracts. These smart contracts automatically self-execute once certain conditions are met and can record necessary changes and information as needed on a shared blockchain ledger.\nThis meant that anyone with an Internet connection could access services without having to request permission from a centralized entity or third party.\nIn a traditional centralized application, there is typically a backend (a server) that contains the detailed logic of the service.\nFor example, suppose a particular app provides a service that sells video games. In that case, various aspects such as the gaming catalog, account information, product prices, and other relevant details are controlled by the backend.\nHowever, any problem with the backend could potentially result in a loss for end users. This could include preventing user access to app services that have been paid for, losing valuable user information, etc. Furthermore, those controlling the app can deny anyone access without recourse from the user.\nApplications using this type of client-server architecture are the norm today. Most popular apps have a centralized design that enables the app developer or entity to have permission to provide access to its users.\nBut this begs the question: What if we could flip this structure and do it another way?\nThis blog will explore this question further and discuss Aiken, a potential solution for developers that enables a faster and simpler dApp development process.\nA dApp aims to flip the centralized app structure by handing power to the end users.\nIt takes the business logic of an app service and uses a distributed ledger or blockchain network to process its operations.\nThey utilize an underlying blockchain platform that is open-source and decentralized with immutable and programmable smart contracts, thereby offering more transparency and accessibility. Transactions could be verified by anyone, relevant information could be looked up by anyone, and there wouldn t be any sort of gatekeeper to manage user access.\nDue to these compelling benefits that confer more control and access to users directly, dApps have become one of the main first use cases of decentralized blockchains.\nMost early adopters of dApps use them to access services that were previously difficult or inaccessible due to various reasons.\nSome examples of dApp services include:\nIn every example above, the logic is executed on top of a decentralized blockchain. There is no need for human intervention once the smart contract and the UI/UX of a dApp are developed. This means they can be more cost-effective to develop and operate than traditional applications.\nThis makes dApps have a greater global reach, more transparency, and more efficiency from a cost perspective. They are also censorship-resistant, meaning a centralized entity can t manipulate information or prevent access to certain users.\nCardano is an open-source, 3rd-generation decentralized blockchain network capable of executing programmable smart contracts, which utilizes a provably secure consensus algorithm to verify and record data.\nIt provides an open platform for developers to use its technology to build dApps.\nDesigned and built with a research-first approach, Cardano is engineered to be scalable for a large number of transactions and data processing, sustainable for generations, and interoperable with other blockchain networks.\nLearn to use a powerful, fast, and easy language to build dApps on Cardano.\nIn fact, Cardano has never experienced a security hack since its inception. This is a major advantage for developers who want to launch their dApp on Cardano and worry less about attacks. Another boon for developers is that the Cardano ecosystem of users and dApps is still growing quickly.\nAs of July 2024, here are some stats & figures on the Cardano network, courtesy of Essential Cardano:\nIn response to the market demand for a simple functional programming language in Cardano, Aiken was built and launched as an ideal solution. This was due to some challenges faced by developers when building dApps utilizing the traditional Cardano tech stack, such as:\nThe goal of Aiken is to enable developers to get quickly onboarded to Cardano by making it simple and easy for them to build dApps in a matter of weeks, without needing to study advanced programming languages like Haskell.\nIt started as an idea between two engineers in the Cardano ecosystem who wanted to provide a simpler and alternative programming language for Cardano. Inspired by TxPipe and with support from the Cardano Foundation, Aiken has grown into a full developer tool along with tutorials and documentation to make the onboarding process as seamless as possible.\nLearn to use a powerful, fast, and easy language to build dApps on Cardano.\nCompared with Plutus and Marlowe, two other Cardano smart contract languages, it provides an easier experience for developers to get started. For example, Aiken:\nAiken is quickly becoming the go-to programming language for developers to build Cardano dApps. It s being used in the smart contracts of many of the most used dApps in Cardano including:\nEnroll now and unlock the secrets to building dApps faster on Cardano.\nSlots are limited and filling up fast.

    "instruction": "DeFi Basics Decentralized Exchanges DEX EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 11, 2024\nEMURGO\nDeFi (decentralized finance) has evolved since really taking off in adoption in 2020. Since its inception, the advancement of the entire DeFi ecosystem as a whole has required a few functioning parts and pieces to provide users with decentralized financial services. In this DeFi Basics series, we will go over these parts and pieces and explain their roles.\nThese primitives are crucial for the proper functioning of any decentralized blockchain and also serve as a pulse for its success. One of these primitives is the decentralized exchange or DEX, which is one of the most important types of applications in DeFi.\nDEXs serve a fundamental purpose not only for users but also for blockchain developers and dApp (decentralized application) projects created on top of a blockchain ecosystem. They are the primary way to swap cryptocurrencies and tokens. They also add liquidity for such crypto and tokens and also help their market price discovery.\nIn this blog, let s take a deeper dive into DEXs.\nA DEX is a peer-to-peer swap market or platform built on a decentralized blockchain network where users can exchange a cryptocurrency or token for another. It s a non-custodial system that does not require third parties to hold the assets to facilitate a transaction. These DEXs are just software protocols and algorithms that facilitate the swapping and transactions of users crypto and tokens peer-to-peer.\nThe matchmaking of the crypto assets and the amount of tokens to be swapped is managed by the logic written on a blockchain-based smart contract which is designed to self-execute once pre-programmed conditions have been met.\nThe execution of the order to do the swap is then processed by the decentralized blockchain network in a completely transparent way. There is a difference in how an automated market maker (AMM) and an order book handle this process, which is discussed below. In both types, the wallet address of the user initiates the swap and it interacts with the logic on-chain.\nDEXs are more a family of technologies where several coexist to provide the same service. There are two main camps in the world of DEXs:\nAdditionally, there is a group called DEX aggregators, which scrape swap pricing information from different DEXs in a single platform, but that s beyond this blog s subject.\nOrder book DEXs are largely analogous to what exists in the traditional centralized financial system, albeit with a lot more decentralization and transparency. The order book is how traditional stock exchanges like NASDAQ match orders, or how centralized crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, etc. allow for trading in cryptocurrencies.\nOn the other hand, AMMs are a technology more native to blockchain and its design.\nThe inner working of a DEX depends on users providing liquidity to a pool. Those who provide it receive a portion of the fees charged by the DEX for their service. A person looking to swap tokens needs to pay two types of fees: the network fee of the blockchain, and the exchange fee of the DEX.\nDEXs are a fundamental part of DeFi because they allow for two important things.\nFirst, it provides price discovery for the cryptocurrency and/or tokens created by different dApp projects.\nSecond, they provide liquidity for said tokens, allowing dApp projects access to funds and also the construction of a dApp treasury.\nThis results in DEXs being one of the earliest projects to appear in a DeFi ecosystem. They are also an important metric to judge a blockchain network s adoption, as transaction volume on DEXs, fees generated, number of liquidity pools, etc. all paint a picture of the overall health of a blockchain. For these reasons, the DEX is one of the fundamental building blocks not only for a blockchain but also for dApp projects building on a blockchain.\nAs mentioned, there are two main types of DEX. Let s go over each.\nAn order book is a matchmaking system where orders are placed in real-time and require constant adjustment. These require actors called market makers who constantly adjust their bids and try to profit from the differences that happen in the price.\nOrder books were the first type of DEX that appeared in the industry, with Ether Delta being the earliest. They are less common because the market makers constantly have to adjust their spread, which means paying fees for open orders that may never be filled. This made order book DEXs expensive to use in the early days of DeFi.\nMany of those that were at the beginning have closed, but the order book is currently having a resurgence. This is especially true on Cardano, where the eUTxO model can work well with the way order books are arranged. The most notable example of this would be Genius Yield which borrows many of the principles of a traditional order book.\nRead more: What is Cardano s eUTxO model?\nThe AMM arose as an answer to the problems order books had operating fully on-chain. The first AMM was introduced by Bancor in 2017, as a permissioned system for those providing liquidity.\nLater, Uniswap launched the first AMM where anyone could add liquidity or create pools, becoming the largest DEX in the industry.\nAMMs work by creating a bonding curve between two tokens. The curve manages the price of the tokens by increasing the swap rate every time one of the tokens is removed from the liquidity pool. The ratio between the 2 tokens in the liquidity pool must always be 50 measured by the price.\nThis can create markets for token pairs almost instantly. The mechanism also doesn t need intermediaries or market makers, like with order books, as the liquidity providers create a market when adding liquidity to a pool.\nThe AMM is the most common type of DEX design in the industry and remains the leader in virtually all blockchains. Some notable examples of DEXs on Cardano are Minswap, SundaeSwap, and WingRiders, just to name a few.\nClick here to sign up\nAre you a finance professional and interested in learning more about DeFi?\nThen, EMURGO s DeFi workshop specifically geared for finance professionals is right for you.\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are hosting a 2-day workshop on DeFi in the early part of 2024 (originally scheduled for January 2024) with speakers from EMURGO, EMURGO Academy, Coinbase Singapore, Merkle Science, and more.\nThe workshop will provide you with a deeper understanding of DeFi, enabling you to prepare for DeFi s evolution, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of DeFi.\nFor more workshop information including dates and registration info, please visit the official registration page here.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Asset Tokenization 101 EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "February 27, 2024\nEMURGO\nBlockchain has grown in many ways, beyond its initial use as a technology platform for censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer payments. It has now been used to develop products and solutions for cross-border remittances and settlements, logistics, product authenticity, and many more applications.\nNowadays, one of the most promising use cases for blockchain is asset tokenization. Asset tokenization enables a business, organization, or individual to take assets, such as commodities, contracts, manufactured goods, and real estate, and represent them as digital tokens on a blockchain platform.\nThis gives traditional assets a tokenized medium to move around and much broader market access to an expanded variety of financial products that previously were unavailable. Asset tokenization has the potential to overhaul entire traditional industries and change the way commerce is done all over the world by making traditional assets more liquid and opening the doors for instantaneous global investment while enhancing the transparency and security of transactions.\nAsset tokenization is a way to convert and represent the value and ownership of physical, intellectual, or financial assets via digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain platform that runs 24/7 and is censorship-resistant. These tokens can represent a whole single unit of the asset, or in some cases, fractions of said assets which can then be sold and owned by interested users around the world.\nAsset tokenization removes geographical borders, minimizes transaction costs, expands markets, increases transparency, and brings a whole new host of investors to previously restricted asset classes due to its digital nature.\nThese tokens can be traded on exchanges, marketplaces, and peer-to-peer using wallets to hold such tokens.\nGenerally speaking, asset tokenization is conducted through the following series of steps:\nFirst, a party or user must identify the asset or asset class that is going to be tokenized. Physical assets are going to have different characteristics than digital ones. Financial products that are digital (stocks, bonds, derivatives) are subject to regulatory laws that have to be followed.\nAll this information must be collected and taken into account for the tokenization of the asset. The regulatory question especially limits the people and organizations who can buy and trade these tokens representing regulated securities.\nOnce the characteristics of the asset are defined, the next step is to choose the best type of token for the asset. The question boils down to two options, whether it is a fungible and non-fungible asset.\nThe fungible token type best suits assets that don t have any differences in their supply. In most cases, there is one that best fits this classification currency. For example, there is no real difference between one dollar and another dollar. These days, fiat-backed stablecoins are a common example where a fungible token makes sense and is increasingly being used due to its ease of transactions.\nMost tokenized assets use the non-fungible or NFT token type. This is because NFTs are more versatile when representing goods outside the blockchain because they can have metadata (readable information about the asset included within the token) adjusted for each token in an NFT group or collection. Many physical assets and intellectual properties are unique and different from one another, such as a diamond or vintage wine bottle.\nRelated reading\nNFTs can be used to tokenize equities, commodities, derivatives, securities, fine art, carbon credits, intellectual property, or any type of asset where there are important differences among them.\nFor example, stocks need to represent not only the company they come from but also the year issued, the dividend paid, and any other characteristic that doesn t make them a uniform whole. The same is true for commodities, art pieces, etc.\nNext, the party or user must match the supply of the token to the asset it will represent. In some cases, fractionalization of the asset makes sense. Big ticket items such as art pieces might be too expensive for a single individual to buy as a whole, but NFTs are a potential solution to this problem.\nAsset fractionalization is where a single NFT is divided into pieces that can be sold to multiple users. The pieces represent a fraction of the whole and can appreciate in value by the same percentage as the whole item the NFT represents. This opens up transactions and access to a much wider range of potential investors, providing liquidity for the seller and investment opportunities for the buyer.\nAsset tokenization can implement an oracle or data feed to provide accurate information about the item, custody, and ownership to the blockchain. Oracles bridge the off-chain and the on-chain world and can provide verifiable and reliable information for the asset to represent its real-world counterpart.\nFinally, the tokenization of the asset must be legally reviewed to ensure it complies with regulatory frameworks, and/or an audit of the asset tokenization can also be done by a reputable, neutral third party not involved in the development of the tokenized asset. This allows it to be impartial when auditing the code and the logic behind the smart contract. If opting for an audit, It s important to select a reputable auditing firm and have the report for the audit made public so that investors can verify and trust the tokenization process.\nThere are too many asset classes to individually account for, but there are generally two categories where they will fit: tangible and digital assets.\nIn most cases, users will be able to look at the metadata of each tokenized asset to see its history of ownership, issuance, and any other important related information to verify the authenticity of the asset. This provides transparency for the buyer and legitimacy to the seller.\nAre you looking for more information on tokenization using blockchain technology?\nEMURGO is partnered with NFT and Tokenization platform NMKR to drive adoption and awareness of the ease and valuable utility of asset tokenization, especially for businesses and creators.\nFollow EMURGO on X to receive updates about the partnership and future events with NMKR.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Reasons Why Business Professionals Should Learn About DeFi EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "December 7, 2023\nEMURGO\nThe world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is developing rapidly and traditional financial businesses are becoming aware of the value DeFi products & services can deliver to users.\nIn fact, since 2019, it s become one of the main driving forces behind blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption. Through self-executing and programmable smart contracts on large decentralized blockchains like Cardano and Ethereum, developers have built self-running software protocols that offer services such as borrowing, lending, and more without a centralized party. These protocols are part of the blockchain-based DeFi ecosystem that has grown immensely over the past few years due to its decentralized nature which offers faster settlement, permissionless access, lower fees in many cases, and a global reach.\nDue to its nascency and lack of awareness, DeFi also has a reputation for being risky. However, more people and organizations are starting to learn about DeFi and its potential implications for the future of finance, especially as the world accelerates toward Web3 which uses blockchain-based products & services and digital transformation.\nIn this blog, we ll delve into the basics of DeFi and show why it s a valuable skill to learn for business professionals and those in traditional enterprises.\nCentralized finance (CeFi) is what those from the DeFi world have dubbed the traditional financial industry. It s a term that aims to denote the main characteristics of both fields. On the one hand, the traditional financial industry offers financial services that are characterized as being permissioned or requiring approval from a centralized financial institution or authority.\nIn the DeFi world, most of these services are permissionless and accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\nThe main factor that separates both worlds is the maintenance of the transaction database or ledger. In CeFi, ledgers are controlled and changed by those institutions in charge of the transactions. The ledger is part of the informatic systems of the institutions and its integrity is ensured by a combination of computer science and traditional regulations.\nIn DeFi, by contrast, ledgers are maintained by a network of computers that are forced by an algorithmic consensus mechanism to reach a global agreement on the transactions on a ledger. This maintains the integrity of the history of transactions without the intervention of authorities or external regulations. In other words, open-source algorithms help the DeFi applications run autonomously and also provide transparency to its users.\nThis is the crucial difference that allows decentralized blockchains to work and never process an incorrect transaction. Also, the smart contracts in a DeFi application allow custom logic to be executed on top of this ledger which gives outcomes that can be verified by everyone transparently.\nIn many developed, emerging, and developing countries, many people still lack access to basic financial services such as savings, and borrowing, and also lack complete control over their funds due to a myriad of factors. Financial institutions can deny such services and hold the centralized authority to make such decisions including enabling their customers to access their funds freely. In DeFi, people have more control over their funds and can access various services as they wish.\nSo, why is learning DeFi valuable? What implications does DeFi have for the future of finance?\nHere are 5 reasons why businesses and professionals should learn about DeFi.\nBlockchains, smart contracts, and DeFi have created a new type of market. One that is fully automated, transactions and outcomes can be defined in code logic and then these can be executed automatically when the conditions are met.\nThe way money can be programmed in DeFi is beyond the capacity of similar systems that are used in traditional finance. In that world, the logic is outside the money system itself, while in DeFi programmability is part of the network from the ground up.\nThe DeFi world never stops, in the most true sense, it is a global and free market. It operates in all parts of the world without any regulatory barriers, it s open 24/7 and it has a constant stream of volume. The DeFi ecosystem is global in a way no other market has ever been.\nAny professional who wants to trade and find opportunities in an almost endless market must know DeFi. The opportunities in this type of environment are far more frequent and bigger than in traditional markets. Especially for those not living close to major financial centers.\nAutomated market makers (AMMs), synthetic assets, liquidity pools, flash loans, and much more are some of the innovations that have already happened in DeFi. The ecosystem is filled with new projects that launch weekly, each trying to add some new functionality previously thought impossible with millions of users and large transaction volume.\nIt is DeFi where the frontier of financial services is located. The next big changes will happen in DeFi and not in the major banks. For those who want to be at the edge of the next wave of changes in the financial industry.\nLedgers in traditional financial institutions are black boxes. Only regulators, lawyers, or accountants working for the institution ever see the complete picture of those transactions. This means that the outsiders are at the mercy of those facts that are disclosed by law or on other particular occasions.\nThe DeFi world is completely the opposite. Anyone can audit a trail of transactions or look for opportunities in the on-chain data. The ledger is 100 visible and transparent, it is both a major boost to security and democratizing information.\nFor those who use the blockchain network, assets are at all times in their possession. There are no intermediaries, and that means no custodial third parties that can remove or take control of an asset not owned by them.\nTransfer and ownership are also simultaneous. In traditional finance, in most cases when an asset is transferred the ownership of said asset is not complete until the books are settled. That can be several days or weeks after the transaction. In DeFi both things happen at the same time as a transaction is settled by the ledger at the moment it happens.\nThose are the advantages DeFi offers for those wanting to learn about the new frontier of finance. It s a new type of market, one that cannot be replicated by any other type of technology and one that will become the standard for the future.\nClick here to sign up\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are teaming up to offer a special 2-day workshop on DeFi to businesses and professionals in Singapore.\nThis 2-day DeFi workshop aims to provide a well-rounded understanding of both blockchain and DeFi (decentralized finance), enabling attendees to make informed decisions, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of this innovative financial space.

    "instruction": "5 Practical NFT RealWorld Use Cases EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "December 19, 2024\nEMURGO\nSince their introduction, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have steadily expanded their utility to potentially be applied to a growing number of real use cases.\nThis is due to various factors, including consistent technological development within blockchain, increased education and awareness, funding opportunities, and more.\nNow, NFTs have become their own ecosystem within the overall blockchain industry, complete with developers, applications, wallets, and users.\nIn this blog, we ll review some of these newer potential use cases and illustrate the versatility of NFTs to provide unique value for businesses, builders, and individuals.\nOur first example pairs NFTs with the act of staking in the blockchain world. Staking is the practice of locking digital tokens or cryptocurrencies in a smart contract on its native decentralized blockchain network to help secure it. In return for this participation, a potential yield is calculated and distributed to the staking user based on the locked period or the number of tokens locked.\nDeFi (decentralized finance) projects in the blockchain space use staking to help regulate the number of tokens available in the open market while rewarding users who choose to lock their tokens.\nNow, as NFTs have grown significantly in popularity and adoption over the years, they are also being used to create these staking positions which enable NFT holders to receive yield while still holding on to their NFTs.\nInstead of using fungible tokens, a DeFi project can create an NFT or a platform specialized in staking NFTs. Then, they utilize a smart contract on a particular blockchain network to lock this NFT with the user receiving a potential yield in return. In some cases, the NFT can be transferred once staked. Therefore, the user can resell the staking position.\nRelated reading:\nAnother merger between NFTs and DeFi involves using the former as loan collateral, where a platform uses a blockchain-based smart contract for lending purposes. The contract is self-executing and effectively takes a valued NFT and calculates the amount of the loan based on its appraisal value without the use of third-party intermediaries.\nAn oracle network then searches for other NFTs within the same collection or any past activity of the same NFT to assign a relative value. The loan is a proportion of the calculated value; in very rare cases, it can be the complete amount.\nIf the owner of the NFT is unable to repay the loan, the asset is automatically transferred to the counterparty. The other party can sell it immediately or keep it until the value of the NFT rises to gain a higher profit.\nThis gives an additional use case for NFTs as they grow in adoption and demand by users.\nRead more: Why business professionals can boost their career by learning about DeFi\nAnother type of potential NFT lending implementation is tokenized bonds. In this case, a borrower needs to get a loan of a certain amount in either a cryptocurrency, token, or stablecoin. A lender provides that loan plus the required interest payment.\nThis is all provided in the form of an NFT bond that acts as a contract and also an asset. If the lender needs funds quickly, they can sell the bond to another person, who will become the counterparty to the borrower.\nThe result is an ecosystem where loans can be liquid assets that are traded freely on-chain using a blockchain network. Loans can be transferred as the need arises, thereby adding flexibility and liquidity to NFT holders.\nMoving away from the DeFi ecosystem, NFTs can serve a role in academia by helping to verify scientific or research papers and assign reputation scores to authors. Today s academia is facing a crisis where submitted papers are plagiarized and don t provide the requisite sources. In some cases, papers are completely fabricated studies.\nPutting these papers on a blockchain network where they can be vetted and verified is an effort. Records would be immutable and transparent. Here, NFTs could serve as a representation of each document and also a collection of its reputation. Papers with fake data would accumulate bad reputations and be ignored for future studies.\nThere is also an increasing demand around the world for revamping how property rights are recorded, especially in underdeveloped regions where a lack of transparency and accountability has led to corrupt practices and other misdeeds.\nNFTs offer a potential solution as they are by nature, immutable records, that can store and record complex information. Transactions and relevant information can be input into the token metadata and recorded on-chain for any party to view. Property holders can be properly registered, accounting information would be clearer, and other details related to the real estate asset could be verified and accounted for with transparency. NFTs also afford the potential ability to divide asset ownership among several parties, lowering the threshold for real estate investment accessibility to more investors.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily create NFTs by providing tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established platform, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets.\nIts various products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support enable businesses and individuals to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even provide traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nInterested in receiving more information on business use cases for NFTs, such as real-world asset tokenization and gaming?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Ways NFTs Can Solve Problems for Musicians EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "August 15, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe music industry is filled with a vast number of stakeholders including record labels, publishing companies, musicians, fans, artist agencies, and other affiliated companies, all over the world.\nOver the past several decades, it has seen a technological progression in recorded music formats from vinyl to cassette tapes to CDs to MP3s, and now streaming. Along with this evolution, control has also gradually shifted from large record companies and music publishing companies to the musicians themselves.\nWhile large music companies continue to still have a significant presence in the industry by having many resources at their disposal, the emergence of blockchain technology has now presented viable alternative solutions for independent music artists to give them more control over their music and careers.\nHere are 5 examples of how blockchain-based NFTs (non-fungible tokens) can be a much-needed solution for these musicians today.\nMusic royalties have commonly been and still are a contentious subject in many cases, especially between artists and record labels. Many lawsuits have been filed between labels, distributors, agents, and musicians around the distribution of royalties, with musicians typically claiming to have been compensated unfairly. In most cases, these royalty rights are unclear or convoluted, leading to protracted court battles.\nNowadays, by using decentralized blockchain technology, NFTs are not only a type of digital token that can represent a specific asset, but they can also represent a set of clearly established rules for an asset.\nThis can enhance transparency and clarity for the musician, record label, and other stakeholders. Artists who wish to stay independent can also receive more benefits by going directly to consumers.\nFor example, there can be an NFT issued by a musician that represents a particular song. This NFT is minted on a blockchain network and the data is stored there. This blockchain network is maintained and kept secure by other participants who are incentivized to do so. Within the NFT s metadata, the distribution of royalties and proceeds from the song can be encoded in a way that is clear for all parties and also made immutable. From that point forward, every transaction involving the NFT must always follow the same rules.\nAny stakeholder is also able to review these sets of conditions at any point and ensure that the distribution is fair for all parties.\nRelated reading:\nCopyright-related issues are another major problem in the music industry. Today, the internet is a huge global sea of information and many content creators use pieces of copyrighted music they find in their social media videos. While some platforms are quick to remove such pieces of content, many still are unable to do so effectively.\nThus, in these cases, proper attribution and compensation to the copyright holder is not given.\nCommonly, this comes down to the complexity of buying song rights and finding where to get them.\nHowever, songs represented as NFTs can represent an established, open market for these pieces of music. Through a consolidated marketplace that lists NFTs of songs and recorded music, they can be used properly by content creators and media companies while also compensating the original copyright holder.\nIf a segment of a song is only used, NFTs can also be priced fractionally, enabling buyers to pay partially.\nBy having stronger copyright enforcement, copyright holders can grab more profits from the purchase of their music NFTs. Artists who own these copyrights can then benefit.\nAnother advantage of NFTs is that they are easier to share and distribute due to their digital nature.\nWhile music can be purchased online these days, this is still mostly done through a centralized platform that takes commissions and stores user data. Settlement for artists and companies can also take several days up to weeks.\nHowever, when music is represented as NFTs, it can be distributed and settled instantly on a blockchain ledger. This enables the transfer of music and payments to be bundled in a single transaction. A consumer or fan would just need a digital wallet that can store, send, and receive NFTs, and be able to pay using cryptocurrencies.\nPayment settlements and music purchases would be instantaneous.\nIf going direct to consumers, independent musicians could have a global reach with their audience while receiving payments immediately.\nPayments on a global scale are a difficult problem. Music platforms usually have to deal with several intermediaries which take commissions from sales and settlements typically take time. Musicians also need to wait for enough money to accumulate before they can withdraw anything from their earnings.\nHowever, NFTs are part of a particular blockchain, where payments are conducted using a token or cryptocurrency issued on that network. Any amount is instantly transferred to the wallet selling an NFT, plus the wallet that collects royalties. This all happens under a single technological system. There is no need to have a separate payment layer.\nThis can mean a potential reduction of the entire burden of fees and the complexity of international payments. The result could support artists to collect more money from their sales and also have direct payments from their followers.\nArtist promotion and connecting with consumers is as much a part of their overall success as the music itself.\nNFTs have the potential to deliver unique value in these areas as well.\nTheir technological properties allow for free NFT drops, meaning musicians can distribute samples of their music for free to hundreds of people directly to their digital wallets. They can also allow for certain types of exclusive fan rewards distributed to every wallet that holds an NFT from a singer or band, instantly creating a community.\nThese NFTs can then be collected and resold, kept as a commemorative item, or even redeemed for other items or benefits from the musician or company issuing them.\nAs the most passionate music fans tend to be of a younger demographic, they are also more technically inclined and more likely to embrace new emerging technologies such as NFTs.\nThis bodes well for musicians who are willing to experiment and integrate the usage of such technologies to attract new fans, increase fan engagement, and enhance control over their careers.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily mint NFTs without having to code by providing simple-to-use tools.\nHaving already partnered with Tiamonds to issue and sell NFTs of physical diamonds and Book.io to tokenize e-books, NMKR has demonstrated successful use cases for NFTs using its platform.\nMusicians can also utilize the platform to mint NFTs to receive some of the benefits listed above.\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to receive weekly updates and blog content on blockchain use cases, NFT insights, Cardano ecosystem news, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "NFT Insights Tokenization of Real Estate EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "April 22, 2024\nEMURGO\nReal estate is one of the most common and largest asset classes. To this day, many people consider real estate an investment and a long-term store of value. As a traditional asset class, huge sums of money are stored in real estate with the support of borrowing and lending services from banks and other financial institutions.\nHowever, investing in real estate can also have some drawbacks.\nDepending on the location, asking price, and type of real estate, the asset can be relatively illiquid requiring much effort to match buyers and sellers. Access to financial services to acquire real estate can be limited for potential buyers due to credit history, geographical location, citizenship status, etc.\nThere can also be a lack of transparency and accountability with land registry information, tax history, and other administrative paperwork depending on the country location of the desired real estate. It could be difficult for would-be buyers from different countries to easily buy portions of their preferred real estate due to legal and financial restrictions.\nSome of these drawbacks could be partially or wholly solved by using blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets.\nIn this blog, let s explore how real estate property can be fractionalized using digital tokens, its implications, and the future of real estate transactions in the age of blockchain.\nFractional ownership refers to a collaborative investment strategy where multiple parties own portions of a real estate property, like a residential home, condominium, apartment, or commercial real estate. This modality of ownership offers each investor specific ownership rights and entitlements to the asset based on their contribution.\nIn some cases, proprietors split ownership by using a legal entity, meaning that a separate legal entity owns the actual property.\nRelated reading:\nAnother legal structure for fractional ownership is the Tenancy-in-common (TIC) which provides all the individual tenants with a deed for a fraction or percentage of a commercial or residential property. The TIC allows individuals to own different percentages of the property but share it equally.\nAnother common type of real estate investment method is through a real estate investment trust (REIT). A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool capital investors who earn dividends from real estate investments. Investors do not individually buy, own, manage, or finance the properties. It is a simple way for investors to gain investment portfolio exposure to real estate, yet do not enable them to own the property.\nHowever, when real estate is tokenized and sold through a secondary market, the token holders own the fractionalized portion of the real estate.\nREITs also have other fees that investors must pay, including asset management fees, acquisition costs, and other expenses.\nAs of now, REITs are listed on major stock exchanges, providing liquidity and an opportunity for investors to invest in real estate. Yet, the investors are responsible for paying fees and do not own the properties outright. With more regulatory clarity for real estate tokenization coupled with more technical development of real estate tokenization platforms and solutions using blockchain technology, the market for real estate tokenization can expand quickly in the future.\nThe barrier to making fractionalized ownership a widespread modality is the complicated part. It is difficult to set up, find, and transact properties that offer this option on an instantaneous global scale, especially via the Internet.\nYet, using blockchain technology and NFTs, a piece of real estate can be instantly fractionalized and tokenized, and digitally represented as an NFT. The NFT contains all the necessary information regarding the real estate asset such as address, type of property, value, insurance status, transaction history, ownership, etc. in the token metadata.\nA legal entity can then take possession of the whole NFT as a custodian and issue fractionalized tokens representing a portion of the total value of the NFT. These tokens are then sold to global individual investors who can buy as much of the property as they wish using their digital token wallet which contains the NFT. This would also allow for quick transaction settlement on a global scale with real-time transparency as transactions can be looked up using blockchain explorers.\nIn most cases, these fractionalized NFT tokens would be considered securities. People looking to buy them would have to go through the usual KYC & AML procedures to be able to buy a token share using a regulated marketplace platform for real estate trading. Properties are part of the securities market, and shares of those properties inherit the same regulatory framework.\nThese tokens could be freely issued and distributed using a decentralized blockchain ledger. Each token would appreciate by the same percentage as the whole property. This means an individual investor can control how much exposure they are willing to tolerate per property.\nHere are some advantages to this mode of property ownership:\nEnhanced liquidity: Real estate is a relatively non-liquid asset. It takes time and effort to match buyers and sellers and find rental tenants. The tokenization of property completely changes this reality. Fractionalized NFTs can be freely issued and traded on secondary markets enhancing the liquidity of the entire asset class. This would spur demand for building regulatory frameworks and marketplaces to facilitate the trading of fractionalized real estate NFTs.\nIncreased transparency: Decentralized blockchain technology ensures that all real estate transactions are recorded and accessible to token holders. Transactions can be searched in real time using blockchain explorers. Token metadata would enable anyone to view important relevant information about the real estate asset. The information would be immutable and censorship-resistant. This gives a heightened sense of security and trust between buyers and sellers. In some parts of the world, there is a lack of transparency and accountability within local governments and with property owners which makes it difficult for buyers to trust the asset they wish to purchase.\nAccessibility: Fractionalized tokens lower the investment barrier for all types of investors. Theoretically, anyone with the necessary funds could buy fractions of real estate properties with an internet connection regardless of their residency location and amount of liquid funds available. There would be less of a need to rely on banking services to grant access to mortgages. People in one country could more easily invest in real estate of their choice in another country.\nPortfolio Diversification: Investors could buy fractionalized shares in several different properties. Rather than having to secure a large amount of funds for a single property, they could choose to invest in several fractionalized portions of tokenized properties. This reduces the risk profile of real estate investments and ensures people can create diverse property portfolios according to their risk tolerance.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It plans to add more tokenization functionalities to its NMKR Studio tool, including open-source smart contract tokenization.\nTo date, NMKR s platform has issued more than 2.2 million NFTs with an overall transaction volume surpassing $65 million for more than 30,000 projects.\nNMKR has already demonstrated a successful use case for asset tokenization through its partnership with Tiamonds to tokenize and sell NFTs of physical diamonds. These NFTs are issued and sold in a 1:1 ratio with each physical diamond insured and stored in vaults. This has enabled diamond buyers and investors to purchase diamonds, gain access to verified information about the purchased diamond through token metadata, and be able to redeem the NFT for the actual diamond at any time.\nRead more: A case study into the tokenization of diamonds through NMKR\nNMKR has also helped to tokenize e-books with Book.io to create true digital book ownership. Currently, when people buy an eBook or Audiobook, they do not technically own it. Readers are only allowed to read or view without the ability to resell them on secondary marketplaces. The tokenization of such books using NMKR s tokenization technology now empowers ebook readers to simply own and transact their e-books as desired.\nWant to stay on top of the latest news about real-world asset tokenization using Cardano?\nFollow EMURGO on X to receive these updates.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Key Benefits of Cardano for RealWorld Asset Tokenization EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "December 3, 2024\nEMURGO\nReal-world asset (RWA) tokenization has become one of the biggest narratives in Web3 and blockchain due to its tremendous potential to transform traditional businesses and create a new asset class.\nBy leveraging the power of decentralized blockchain technology, tokenization opens up numerous possibilities for real-time asset transactions on a global scale, free from the constrictions of geographical location, time, and other outdated and inefficient business processes. To achieve this, real-world assets are digitally represented as an NFT or token issued and recorded on a decentralized blockchain. Once issued or minted, these tokens can be globally transacted between buyers and sellers.\nTo accommodate this significant technological and financial transformation, several decentralized blockchain networks are up and running but with their own limitations.\nHowever, the Cardano blockchain network has several key strengths and properties that can seamlessly merge real-world assets with blockchain technology for a new generation of businesses and individual users, providing users with a competitive advantage.\nLet s outline some of Cardano s key benefits below.\nSecurity is paramount when dealing with user information, assets, and financial transactions.\nTo date, several billions have been stolen in various hacks and exploits in dApps built on other popular decentralized blockchain networks.\nThis problem mainly stems from the inherent account-based model of most of these networks. In it, every digital token created requires a new smart contract to be launched. This means the smart contract code could potentially contain errors, or the developers could intentionally introduce malicious bugs to the detriment of users. Fundamentally, some view this as one of the biggest drawbacks of an account-based blockchain model and is one of the reasons that has led to security breaches.\nHowever, In Cardano, digital tokens are considered native to the network and thereby do not require a new smart contract for every new token issued. There is no need to create a smart contract to tokenize a new asset. The result is a more simplified pipeline for the issuance of tokens and a more secure model.\nFurthermore, the Cardano blockchain network has not experienced a security breach or hack in its network history spanning several years.\nAnother issue with other decentralized blockchain networks is that user transactions are not deterministic. This means that it s fundamentally impossible to know if a transaction will succeed or fail before it s initiated.\nAdditionally, it s also impossible to calculate what the fee for the transaction will be before it s completed. The cost remains an unknown variable for all parties involved, so there is no way to calculate its profitability when margins are small which is especially important for businesses looking for some measure of cost predictability.\nRelated reading:\nIn Cardano, fees and transactions are deterministic. Once submitted to the network, a transaction is 100 guaranteed to be successful. Also, the transaction fee is confirmed to the user before an initiated transaction and will not change.\nUnder this model, transactions can be a predictable variable for any business, project, or user. Real-world assets can be tokenized on Cardano with deterministic fees and transactions, and then securely traded with a network guarantee that conditions won t change in the future. This makes things simpler for businesses and developers to plan when considering asset tokenization.\nAs noted, another powerful advantage of Cardano is the fixed fees. In the smart contract or account-based model, the transaction fees can vary because computations have to be performed each time the token is used. The costs remain an elusive variable that can not be predicted, making it more difficult for businesses to predict the costs of tokenization. During busy periods with a congested blockchain network, users have to pay a higher fee to compensate for a faster transaction.\nIn Cardano, the deterministic model and not having to have a smart contract for digital tokens makes it easier to predict costs. The fees shown in the wallet are always the same as those paid by the user and network congestion is significantly reduced.\nTransactions can be settled faster with less friction and deterministic fees that are significantly less than those of other networks without compromising on security.\nIn the account model, transactions have to be processed one by one to maintain a global order. Each input results in one output, and the blockchain network maintains itself over time using this logic. There is no way to group transactions that do not involve a smart contract, which can introduce more security vulnerabilities.\nIn Cardano, transactions can be batched and sent to several user wallets while paying a single fee. For example, businesses looking to tokenize certain assets and use them as a marketing campaign to distribute to certain consumer wallets can save costs considerably by using this approach without having to pay multiple transaction fees.\nOne transaction can have several outputs that serve dozens or even hundreds of users simultaneously at the cost of a single transaction.\nAnother significant strength of the Cardano network is expanded token metadata storage and how it is recorded. Token metadata is the essential information about the tokenized asset contained within an issued digital token. This enhances transparency for both buyers and sellers of a token.\nIn most blockchain networks, the metadata or a token is stored in an external system. This could be a cloud solution or a decentralized storage network. Users have to trust that the information recorded is accurate and won t be erased in the future.\nHowever, Cardano records the token metadata in the network itself. As a result, it can be considered to be more reliable and safe as no one can arbitrarily decide to erase it or change it. The information is also linked to the token forever, making it easy to track. Cardano also provides the ability to store more data within the token compared to some other networks.\nThis is a crucial necessity for RWAs and businesses because these assets need their external information linked to the token and confer trust to their consumers and other buyers.\nCardano is an open-source, decentralized blockchain network and platform that enables anyone to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can offer a variety of accessible economic services. As the first blockchain to be founded on peer-reviewed research and development through scientific, evidence-based methods, Cardano has processed more than 100 million transactions and nearly 2,000 dApps are being built on the network as of November 2024.\nRead more: Why building on Cardano is more secure\nThe unique value of a decentralized blockchain network lies in its ability to operate without a centralized authority, secured and managed by its users that utilize the network s consensus algorithm. This creates a decentralized network that can provide verified and transparent trust between its users and can be the basis for creating and sustaining its dApps.\nContact us here to learn more.\nAre you a business or project interested in NFTs and asset tokenization using the Cardano blockchain?

    "instruction": "NFT Insights Tokenization of Tangible Intangible Assets EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "June 6, 2024\nEMURGO\nThis weekly blog series provides insights into various NFT use cases including real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and other related educational content.\nNFTs or non-fungible tokens, are starting to expand beyond their initial use cases for art and media distribution and into new exciting use cases.\nAs discussed in previous blogs, one of the biggest potential use cases for NFTs and their underlying blockchain technology is asset tokenization which includes many different kinds of asset types.\nLargely, these asset types such as stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and more are broken down into tangible (physical and measurable assets that can depreciate in value) or intangible (non-physical assets).\nWith blockchain technologies fast evolving and new applications emerging by being built on top of these technologies, NFT applications are also naturally evolving right alongside to have broader appeal.\nAs this new growth phase in the blockchain industry continues, new use cases for NFTs are beginning to emerge and show adoption potential.\nLet s discuss some of these these below.\nAccording to the World Intellectual Property Organization, intellectual property (IP) is defined as creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.\nIP is internationally protected by the laws in most countries through patents, copyrights, and trademarks, enabling creators and innovators to earn recognition and rewards for their work.\nOne of the potential drawbacks of the current system of managing IPs is that some databases are kept domestically without any cross-border coordination.\nThese databases sometimes lack connections with ones beyond their borders, creating uncertainty, especially for Internet-based companies.\nSometimes this is referred to as patent thickets, the result of overlapping intellectual property rights that occur in fragmented markets. The legal challenges for two entities claiming the same patent can be lengthy and result in delays when deploying technology as innovators file their claims.\nIt is becoming more common to read headlines about IP being at the center of conflicting claims between parties. In the digital realm, for example, content creators have conflicts with each other and also with content hosting platforms about IP.\nNFTs have the potential to solve these problems by creating IP claims and having a blockchain transparently record them. NFTs also have the potential to record essential information within the token itself in its metadata which can reduce conflicts over the origin of the IP.\nThese records would be immutable and hard to censor as they are verified and kept on a decentralized blockchain, accessible to all parties.\nRelated reading:\nThus, a decentralized blockchain ledger could be used as the record of truth to see which party owns what.\nThese NFTs could also be used to automate payments for IP holders. For instance, a song used in a video could be purchased for use directly by a content creator from a secondary music marketplace managed using smart contracts.\nAnother use of NFTs is to tie them to a physical, tangible object in continuous demand. The aim is to preserve the unique properties of the object in the metadata of the asset for when it goes to the secondary market.\nThis is especially useful for collector items with a robust resale market and tends to exchange hands frequently before use.\nPremium spirits are one such example, where many buy a bottle of a certain type to resell it later. Validating such an object is difficult, leading to many counterfeits for these items.\nSome premium spirit companies host an NFT promotion where each bottle contains a QR code tied to the NFT. These, in turn, provide proof of ownership for each bottle.\nOther collector items including sports cards, shoes, and more lend themselves as potential NFT use cases where brands can tap into a new young consumer demographic interested in and willing to utilize emerging technologies.\nThrough NFTs and digital asset wallets, brands and creators can start to develop new business models, unlock more creativity, and enhance the liquidity and transparency of their assets.\nMany tangible assets in the world have a lot of value but lack liquidity.\nThis is because transferring ownership of these assets is overly complicated, creating a small market for them. This can result in cases where a tangible asset can have a valuation of millions of dollars, but relatively few ways for the asset owner to sell it for that amount.\nNFTs are now potentially able to create markets for these assets with relatively low liquidity. This is done by creating fractional ownership, which takes an asset that is difficult to divide, creates an NFT of it, and locks it up in a smart contract. The contract can create fractions of the NFT which can be sold and traded.\nAn example is the fractionalized Volkswagen, which is a smaller piece of a Volkswagen car portrait that is an NFT itself.\nAnother example of NFT fractionalization is in real estate.\nMany properties around the world have locked liquidity. This means that even though there is value to be tapped in them, it is very difficult due to the total price of the location. Only a few people can purchase a major ticket item due to reasons such as financing, location of the asset, liquidity, etc.\nHere, NFT fractionalization is a potential solution to enable more liquidity by bringing in more potential buyers for a tokenized asset.\nAnother potential use case that opens up with NFTs and asset tokenization is usage as collateral.\nIn many cases, an asset owner wants to access the liquidity of an asset, but not relinquish control over that item. They may need funds for a temporary trade, purchase other things, or as part of an arbitrage strategy.\nTokenized versions of these assets could in theory have access to a whole DeFi (decentralized finance) market via NFTs and collateralized loans. In this version, an asset owner could request a loan and lock the NFT of the asset as a guarantee. Once the loan is repaid, the NFT is given back to the owner without any intermediary slowing the process down.\nMuch more clarity, frameworks, and products and services would have to be adopted for this to gain more traction.\nFor example, physical diamonds have been successfully tokenized as NFTs, demonstrated by Tiamonds and its partnership with NFT service NMKR. These NFTs are backed by real diamonds and can be redeemed for the physical item at any time. They have intrinsic value and could potentially be used as secure collateral in the future if clarity is given.\nNMKR enables businesses and individuals to tokenize assets in the form of Cardano blockchain NFTs.\nTo date, NMKR has already demonstrated a real use case for asset tokenization through its partnership with Tiamonds to tokenize and sell NFTs of physical diamonds issued and sold in a 1:1 ratio with each actual diamond.\nRead more: A case study into the tokenization of diamonds through NMKR\nNMKR has also tokenized e-books with Book.io to create true digital book ownership. When people buy an eBook or Audiobook, they do not technically own it. Readers are only allowed to read or view without the ability to resell them on secondary marketplaces. The tokenization of such books using NMKR s tokenization technology now empowers ebook readers to own and transact their e-books.\nEMURGO is a global blockchain technology company that provides a variety of Web3 products & services including technical infrastructure development, blockchain education, investment, and media.\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for more content and updates on use cases for blockchain including NFTs and asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

Through token metadata and other technologies, innovation is emerging within the NFT sector.\nThis blog discusses Dynamic NFTs as one of these innovations and how they could potentially be used by businesses, organizations, and individuals moving forward.\nToken metadata is a key element separating NFTs from traditional fungible tokens.\nAlthough a transfer of a fungible token can have metadata, it usually refers to information about the transaction and not the actual asset itself.\nHowever, metadata in an NFT refers to information about the asset or project itself, or attributes of a certain collection.\nIn other words, NFT metadata records and displays information about the tokenized asset rather than the transaction of a token.\nMetadata, for this reason, is very important for an NFT.\nBut there are also several limitations associated with it.\nRelated reading: EMURGO Academy explains token metadata and NFTs\nFor example, while on-chain storage or storing the NFT metadata on a blockchain is considered to be more secure, it also tends to be expensive, especially as the accumulated information grows.\nOff-chain storage, or storing the NFT metadata somewhere else, can sometimes be cheaper but it is riskier and does not guarantee long-term availability as it also might depend on the service provider helping to store the NFT metadata.\nIf the server storing the metadata goes offline or is hacked, the information can be lost. This can be permanent if safe practices for creating and storing data backups for the data are also not in use.\nFor this reason, the Cardano blockchain network offers space in the network to store increased metadata. This information is saved by the nodes and does not need to rely on an external party to store the metadata.\nThis saves NFT developers from having to complicate their token s design by using third-party storage providers. The metadata recorded on Cardano also remains safe long term, as it s backed by the nodes themselves.\nThis simplification reduces the work of NFT developers and projects and also those looking to buy the assets as they don t have to verify the storage of the metadata to ensure it is safe to buy the token.\nAt the moment, most NFTs issued on the Cardano blockchain work using the standards set out by Cardano Improvement Proposal 25 or CIP-25. lt outlines the metadata format needed to enable Cardano wallets to read NFTs.\nIt has created a uniform way to mint NFTs on Cardano, but it also has some limitations.\nNotably, CIP-25 metadata is fixed.\nThis means once metadata has been created, it cannot be updated later nor can more information be added once the asset has been minted as an NFT.\nFor fixed NFT collections of artwork or other creations, this has worked wonderfully, as the immutability of metadata increases the security of the asset. But for other use cases, this is not the case.\nThis is where the concept of mutable metadata or Dynamic NFTs becomes useful.\nThis is a format that allows the modification or update of the information contained in the metadata after the NFT or token is minted. This greatly expands the utility of NFTs to new potential use cases.\nThese NFTs with mutable metadata are known as Dynamic NFTs because the information can be changed later by following certain rules that allow them to be more versatile.\nDynamic NFTs have use cases where certain initial conditions are prone to later change, such as:\nCardano as an open-source blockchain network has incorporated all the necessary tools of Dynamic NFTs via the adoption of CIP-68.\nThis community proposal, titled Datum Metadata Standard, ensures rules to update and modify NFT metadata.\nThis has also been adopted by all digital asset wallets in the Cardano ecosystem such as Yoroi, making it a ready-to-use feature by NFT developers to enable their tokens to be integrated with Cardano wallets.\nNMKR, an NFT and tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain, has also added CIP-68 to its NMKR Studio tool library.\nThus, businesses and creators can release NFTs and tokenized assets via NMKR Studio using these added tools and give more utility to their NFT collections with the ability to update and modify metadata as needed.\nLooking to stay updated on Cardano NFTs and asset tokenization?

    "instruction": "How Big the Asset Tokenization Market Can Become EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "April 4, 2024\nEMURGO\nReal-world asset tokenization is one of the most popular narratives in blockchain. It is one of the biggest potential use cases for blockchain technology and could spur the next significant digital transformation of traditional industries.\nThis new narrative is also directing large investments into the real-world asset tokenization market, especially into products & services that are in development. The goal is to grab a big share of this potentially lucrative market and bring tokenized assets into a particular blockchain ecosystem.\nIn this blog, let s discuss how much the real-world asset tokenization market can grow and why blockchain developers are focusing their efforts on it.\nAs mentioned in a previous blog explaining the two main types of asset classes, real-world assets are tangible in that they have some sort of physical component to make them real in the sense of being concrete or having material properties.\nThese can be currencies, collectibles, real estate, fine art, commodities such as precious metals, diamonds, raw materials, and more.\nTraditional digital assets are intangible such as stocks, bonds, intellectual property, financial derivatives, etc.\nBoth types of assets can be digitally represented and transacted as a token issued on a blockchain.\nRelated reading:\nIn some cases, this can be done quickly using smart contracts and tokens.\nIn other cases, this can be more complicated as some of these assets are subject to stricter regulations and compliance measures. ]\nYet, the technology and potential exist for real-world and traditional digital assets to be brought into a blockchain network through tokenization, and then for the token to be transacted and recorded on that network.\nThe unique benefits of asset tokenization include:\nIt is a little tricky to estimate the actual valuation of the current asset tokenization market due to different methods of estimation.\nHowever, one of the most useful examples is looking at stablecoins which are one of the earliest forms of asset tokenization.\nA stablecoin is a digital blockchain-based token that is backed by deposits of fiat currencies and other financial instruments, in essence, tokenization of currencies. Some of the most common ones in circulation are Tether USDT and Circle USDC which are based on the US dollar.\nOn the other hand, stablecoins that use cryptocurrencies as a reserve and algorithms to create a peg with the U.S. dollar or other fiat currency are not considered real-world assets. These types of assets are called synthetic assets as they mirror the properties of a real-world asset, but do not rely on the ownership of the original instrument. In most cases, these types of tokens are excluded from the total market calculation.\nAnalytics firms such as 21.co value the current asset tokenization market (as of writing) at around $87 billion with stablecoins accounting for 97 of that total value.\nThis means that other use cases for asset tokenization such as commodities, real estate, collectibles, stocks, bonds, etc. have yet to take off and can significantly expand in the years to come.\nNow that we have an understanding of the current size of the asset tokenization market and its reliance on stablecoins, we can discuss some basic projections.\nThe list of real-world and traditional digital assets that can be tokenized is almost endless, so there are a lot of possibilities.\nThe same report by 21.co has three forecasts:\nThe chart divides real-world assets into six categories and then uses them to give projections of where things can be by the end of 2030.\nIn another forecast, Boston Consulting Group projects tokenized financial assets to be valued at $11 trillion by 2030.\nMost of the growth is projected to come from other assets that are not fiat currencies as can be expected. The current RWA market is dominated by the tokenization of fiat in the form of stablecoins. As this sector is almost saturated, future growth will come from other real-world assets being tokenized.\nAn example of this trend is US government bonds. In 2023, the tokenization of these assets grew 450 , making it the largest asset class to be tokenized over the past year. This is just one example of where the market is already moving. Singapore s central bank has started testing tokenization with established financial institutions and working on a tokenized government bond fund. Asian countries such as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, and European countries such as Germany, Luxembourg, France, and Switzerland have tested issuing digital bonds as well. To date, only about $4 billion of tokenized bonds have been issued with the traditional global bond market valued at $130 trillion.\nThese facts give a glimpse into what the future holds for asset tokenization as governments and financial institutions are testing the tokenization of traditional digital assets such as bonds. Once more regulatory clarity is given and more products and services come into the market, asset tokenization can take its next leap forward.\nLooking for more content on real-world asset tokenization using blockchain technology?\nEMURGO has partnered with NFT and Tokenization platform NMKR to drive the adoption of asset tokenization leveraging the Cardano blockchain via NMKR.\nFollow EMURGO on X to receive more updates on tokenization and future in-person events with NMKR.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "DeFi and Regulations EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 9, 2024\nEMURGO\nDeFi (decentralized finance) started to gain adoption and users in 2020, experiencing a 20x fold increase in TVL (total value locked) within the DeFi ecosystem. Since then, a lot of new DeFi applications have been built and launched, enabling users all over the world to leverage their crypto assets for a variety of decentralized financial services including lending, borrowing, staking for yield, and more. With this explosive growth in DeFi and crypto overall, regulations have also started to gain more discussion to create a framework for regulators on how to best approach the ongoing development of DeFi.\nAs DeFi is still in a state of regulatory discussion and its applications are designed to be peer-to-peer services leveraging decentralized blockchain technology, users are left vulnerable to security risks, hacks, and other flaws that can let hackers exploit the code of a DeFi application. While DeFi has been on a consistent trajectory of development and adoption, its nascency and risks mentioned above have led to creating an atmosphere of uncertainty to prevent many crypto users from fully engaging with DeFi applications.\nThe current state of DeFi is one of rising awareness and discussion among traditional financial institutions and government regulators. Many are coming to understand DeFi s potential benefits and risks and are thinking of ways to embrace a healthy legislative balance between innovation and regulation.\nHowever, developers and users continue to build new DeFi products and services and upgrade existing ones and increased awareness brings new users into the DeFi ecosystem.\nThe question now is Where does DeFi go from here?\nMost would agree that there is a clear need to either create or modify existing regulations to accommodate the innovative features and growth of DeFi while protecting users.\nLet s take a look at the basic building blocks of DeFi and the current state of DeFi regulations to answer this question.\nAll ecosystems require some sort of basic blocks that can be used for more complex use cases. DeFi is no different, let s describe them:\nCryptocurrency or digital coin: A digital asset that operates independently of any other platform. It is the main or underlying native asset of a blockchain network and it s used to pay for transaction fees. They are the backbone of a certain blockchain and the engine of an ecosystem. Examples of coins include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA).\nToken: A type of cryptocurrency built on top of another blockchain. It does not have its native blockchain network. Often they are created to serve as a utility asset for a platform or project built on top of a blockchain like those mentioned above. Tokens can be fungible and interchangeable or non-fungible and unique which can serve as NFTs.\nOracle: A third-party service that provides blockchain-based smart contracts with external data. This can range from digital asset price feeds for cryptocurrencies and NFTs to real-world price feeds for commodities and interest rates. These data streams are often crucial for more complex DeFi platforms like lending marketplaces, making oracles a critical part of the DeFi world to provide up-to-date and accurate relevant information for users.\nSmart Contract: An arbitrary logic that is executed on top of a decentralized blockchain. Arbitrary means that any type of logic can be run on top of a blockchain. In most cases, it s the business logic that governs the revenue sources for a project or decentralized application (dApp). Smart contracts can be programmed to contain certain conditions that enable the contract to self-execute for its participants once the conditions have been met.\nThe world of DeFi remains in an opaque state. Due to political reasons and/or a lack of general awareness, many of the main regulatory bodies across the world have yet to give a clear framework for this new economic model. This has, in turn, created a space filled with uncertainty for companies, users, and developers, as regulatory agencies can act as final arbitrators by taking legal action on a case-by-case basis.\nLet s look at a few of the major crypto markets in the world to see their current stance on DeFi.\nThe U.S. remains in a deadlock regarding a regulatory framework for blockchain at large and DeFi specifically. Major legislative efforts and talks to discuss frameworks have fallen short and regulators have taken a regulation by enforcement approach. The result has been enormous uncertainty.\nThere has been considerable debate between differing members of the legislature about creating guidelines, but a lack of consensus and interest has stalled the advancement of these discussions.\nCongress had also proposed imposing identity verification measures for DeFi applications.\nThe E.U. is ahead with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) draft legislation. It aims to create an all-encompassing legal framework for the regulation of crypto assets in the E.U. The objective of MiCA is to take some of the lessons learned so far and establish definitions and best practices for the industry.\nThe main tasks for the MiCA framework are:\nThe effort is well underway and it has been approved at the level of the E.U. government bodies. The initial portions of MiCA are expected to take effect by June 2024, and all of the provisions by the end of the same year.\nOne aspect of MiCA that is very controversial is the banning of all algorithmic stablecoins and only allowing fiat-backed stablecoins. The latter also have to do regular audits and prove they have a 1-to-1 reserve ratio for all tokens in circulation.\nIn Asia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore are the countries typically mentioned at the forefront of crypto regulation. These countries have been taking a more active approach towards creating regulatory frameworks for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) and clarity through guidelines and a more supportive stance.\nEach is striving to become a leader for Web3 in general while specific guidelines for DeFi-related properties such as stablecoins are usually more commonplace. In Japan, Circle partnered with Japanese securities company SBI Holdings to seek the distribution of its USDC stablecoin while Hong Kong and Singapore have been granting license approvals for various VASPs to run their businesses in each region.\nIn addition to granting licenses, and tax guidelines, discussions on DAOs, ETFs and more have been on the agenda.\nIn contrast with the US, Asia has taken measures to embrace Web3 which in turn might also lead to more clarity and guidelines for DeFi.\nIn the three examples above, we see the current approaches to DeFi have different realities. While Web3 and crypto as a whole might be supported, we have yet to see clearer definitive guidelines for DeFi other than those related to stablecoins.\nIt remains an open question as to what will be the effects of these ongoing guidelines, but clearer regulations also mean some DeFi products or features might not be allowed in certain jurisdictions.\nOnly time will tell if the MiCA and Asian frameworks help or hamper DeFi. While it should theoretically onboard more users to crypto as a whole, the implications for DeFi are unknown.\nAt the very least, a couple of major regions are tackling the challenge of regulating the blockchain and embracing the advent of blockchain technology to transform industries and create economic growth. This embrace and support should lead to more discussions and guidelines for specific sectors of blockchain and crypto such as DeFi as well.\nRead more: 5 most promising use cases for DeFi\nClick here to sign up\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are hosting a 2-day workshop on DeFi for business and finance professionals in Singapore in January 2024 with speakers from EMURGO, EMURGO Academy, Coinbase Singapore, Merkle Science, and more.\nThis DeFi workshop will provide a comprehensive overview of DeFi, enabling attendees to make informed decisions, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of DeFi.\nFor more workshop information including dates and registration info, please visit the official registration page here.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Protecting Your Crypto in Yoroi Popular Wallet Scams EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "April 18, 2024\nEMURGO\nHistorically, the crypto market has moved in cycles and each bull swing has brought in newcomers to the space, attracted by headlines and word of mouth. This has naturally increased the prevalence of bad actors looking to take advantage of such newcomers through scams and other phishing schemes. These can result in a major loss of user funds who unknowingly take part in such schemes. Thus, at all times individual crypto users need to remain vigilant when operating in Yoroi and double-check information when conducting crypto transactions.\nPrivate keys are protected through powerful encryption on Yoroi, which prevents attackers from directly stealing crypto assets. Therefore, if a user has not disclosed their seed phrase, these scams generally require the user to inadvertently sign a fraudulent transaction. Scammers have found success using social engineering to trick users into signing harmful transactions.\nThis is why self-custodial wallets like Yoroi are the first line of defense against these scams. It s important to understand the nature of the attacks to spot them ahead of time, and never sign one of these malicious transactions.\nIn this blog, we ll go over some of the most popular types of crypto scams that result in users unintentionally approving a fraudulent transaction and how to safeguard against them.\nFor user security, Yoroi Wallet does NOT store seed phrases. Only the wallet owner has access to their seedphrase so it s important to keep this phrase in a safe place.\n1. Fake popular URLs\nThis scam is a modification of the classic phishing attack. In it, attackers create an identical-looking copy of a legitimate website and use that to lure unsuspecting victims. The fake site uses the same style, font, and branding as the original which can make it difficult to notice, even for experienced users.\nOnce a potential victim has entered the fraudulent site, a request opens in their crypto wallet and asks them to sign a transaction. This results in the user approving a transfer that drains the funds contained in his/her wallet.\n2. Fake wallet apps and extensions\nIn the digital landscape of cryptocurrency, the emergence of fake wallets represents a pressing concern, especially within trusted marketplaces like the Chrome and Android app stores. These fraudulent entities cleverly masquerade as legitimate cryptocurrency wallets, leveraging the trust and credibility established by genuine projects.\nBy adopting the guise of authenticity, fake wallets entice unsuspecting users into a trap, prompting them to input sensitive information like seed phrases or to transfer their digital assets directly into the hands of scammers. This form of deception not only capitalizes on the enthusiasm surrounding cryptocurrencies but also exploits the inherent trust users place in app stores vetting processes, underscoring a significant vulnerability in the digital asset space.\n3. Airdropped tokens or NFTs with links to fake sites\nAnother common type of crypto wallet scam or fraud consists of scammers sending new tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to targeted wallets to lure unsuspecting victims to a fake site. A user then discovers these new counterfeit assets in their wallet even though they haven t bought these assets, which have arrived unsolicited. These NFTs and/or tokens, in their metadata, prompt the user to enter a website where they are typically promised lucrative offers to claim additional rewards, which are advertised to be free as part of a special promotion.\nThe unsuspecting user enters the website, which opens their browser-based crypto wallet claiming to be a transaction to mint new rewards for free. Instead, the user again is signing off their entire wallet balance to the attackers who created the fake sites.\nRead more: What is an NFT and metadata?\n4. Fake airdrops\nAirdrop scams are another type of common attack used by hackers in the crypto industry. Airdrops are promotions whereby a digital token or a cryptocurrency is automatically delivered to certain user wallets. On the surface, it would seem to users that they would be receiving crypto for free. Airdrop scams use social engineering to exploit the willingness of crypto users to participate in incentivization programs to open their wallets and create a transaction that drains their funds.\nFor this type of crypto scam, the attackers pose as a legitimate protocol or influencer, promoting a fake airdrop portal that requests users to connect their wallets on a website. The sites are always very well constructed and seem official. Sometimes, these sites may request the seed phrase of a user s wallet. If not, they ask to sign a transaction that claims to be an airdrop when, in fact, it drains the user s crypto wallet of all its assets.\nThese types of scams are propagated on all forms of social media, email, and text messaging including YouTube.\nA website s name is often purchased on a domain name service. This means the name is reserved for the person or organization who bought that particular word or combination of words. Attackers often use very similar names but with slight variations in the actual spelling of the domain.\nAnother common tactic is to buy the same domain name but use a different extension. For example, if the domain name is under an extension .com, attackers will buy the same name but with an extension .org, .io, .site, or any other valid extension on the market.\nThe official website for Yoroi Wallet is https://yoroi-wallet.com.\nLegitimate projects and products usually always buy the security certificate for their website. When you go to a site that uses HTTPS (connection security), the website s server uses a certificate to prove the website s identity to commonly used internet browsers such as Brave, Chrome, Opera, Edge, etc.\nThis gives some added measure of security that the site is the correct one.\nYet, an SSL certificate by itself is not enough to ensure the authenticity of a site.\nIt s a good first line of defense, but other verification methods are also needed as all good scams use SSL certificates. If a website does not have an SSL certificate, that may be a cause for concern, but having an SSL certificate should not inspire confidence on its own.\nAttackers often contact crypto users on popular social media applications such as X, Reddit, Telegram, Discord, and others with promotions to airdrops, giveaways, general investment opportunities, and other too good to be true campaigns. Any unsolicited message should be viewed with caution and suspicion. Never give any personal information to people who randomly message to engage and never click on any unverified link provided in those messages.\nThe seed phrase is the master key of any crypto wallet. A dApp will never ask for the seed phrase of a wallet to work, as it only needs the user s signature on a transaction. Therefore, always leave any site asking for this information.\nThe battle against such scams necessitates a dual approach, combining user vigilance with community-driven education.\nFor users, it is imperative to download wallets exclusively from verified, official sources. This cannot be overstated, acting as the first line of defense against fraudulent schemes.\nMoreover, the open-source nature of projects like Yoroi Wallet offers an additional layer of security, allowing the community to inspect, audit, and verify the integrity of the software they re entrusting with their assets. This culture of transparency and self-custody is emblematic of the broader Cardano ecosystem s ethos, which champions decentralization and user empowerment.\nAs the crypto community continues to navigate these challenges, fostering an environment of awareness and skepticism towards unverified sources becomes crucial in safeguarding digital assets against the threat of fake wallets.\nSome tips to avoid downloading a fake wallet:\nAlso, before installing the app, review the publication on the store and ask yourself:\nAs stated before, attackers use slightly different spelling or a different extension to lure victims to a fake website. For this reason, never click on a link provided on a message, tweet, post on a message board, email, or any sort of public forum.\nIf a crypto product or dApp has caught your attention, look for URLs found through official sources. Verify the URL with the project s official channels (more than one), join the community, and read some of the messages to verify they are talking about the project as explained. There is no method to 100 proof check projects, especially if they are small or have been around for a short period.\nHere, the best advice we can provide is to have a secondary wallet, one that holds minimal funds, or better yet, no funds. That way, when a site asks to sign a suspicious transaction, no crypto assets are at risk.\nStop and carefully review any transaction before it s signed by your wallet. This is the last stop before any change is made to the balance of a crypto account so there is no need to rush. That is the main stopgap that prevents any sort of funds from being misallocated.\nSo, before signing a transaction always take your time to review the input required and the expected result. No one can move funds from a crypto wallet without the user s signing on a transaction.\nIf digital tokens or crypto magically pop up in your wallet s balance that were not purchased directly, be very cautious with them. In some cases, projects do send tokens of NFTs to users for free to create buzz for a new service or platform.\nYet, this practice has been corrupted by attackers who instead use these assets to direct users to a scam website. If a token directs you to a website, don t use the link provided. Instead, research the project, go through their socials, and see if the token is legitimate.\nNever use a link or URL provided on a public forum or a third party. Either look for the name of the service on a search engine or from an official social media post. Always check the spelling of the site and also the extension used by the project.\nAfter verifying the official site of a project, bookmark the address in a web browser. In the future, this will give direct and secure access to the same website without having to rely on links or other external references.\nMany extensions can be found on the tools that check the authenticity of a site. These can give immediate warnings if the certificate of the site does not match the name of the URL, or worse, if the site has no certificate at all.\nFinally, always double-check the conditions of a transaction before signing. When interacting with smart contracts, the wallet will provide the address of the contract. Use it to compare it with the one posted by the project or ask in their social media channels to share the official smart contract address.\nDeveloped by EMURGO Fintech, a division within EMURGO, Yoroi is an open-source crypto wallet for the Cardano ecosystem. Yoroi is also self-custodial, meaning the user has complete control over their Cardano ADA and can use it to stake and transact as preferred.

    "output": "August 3, 2023\nEMURGO\nContents\nYoroi Wallet, EMURGO s open-source light wallet for Cardano, is packed with features that help users get the most security out of their wallets.\nIn this blog, we ll look at Yoroi Wallet s self-custody feature and discuss how it helps our users keep their assets safe.\nYoroi is a self-custody crypto wallet, meaning users have their digital assets, allowing users to always have complete control over their ADA and other Cardano native assets.\nSelf-custody refers to individuals or entities directly managing and securing their digital assets, without relying on third-party custodians, such as an exchange.\nThe concept emphasizes that an individual should maintain personal control over their crypto wallet s private key, eliminating the need to depend on others for this crucial task.\nSelf-custody fosters an understanding of potential risks, motivating users to educate themselves on optimal cybersecurity and asset management strategies, as well as empowering individuals to assume accountability for the protection of their digital assets.\nControl: Self-custody provides complete control over funds without relying on third-party custodians. Users have direct access to their assets, enabling them to transact, store, and manage them as they see fit.\nSecurity: Self-custody offers enhanced security by eliminating the risk of a centralized third party being hacked, going bankrupt, or engaging in fraudulent activity, as your assets are protected by your private keys, which are under your control.\nPrivacy: Avoiding centralized platforms through self-custody not only safeguards privacy and anonymity but also enables users to keep their transactions and financial activities confidential, thereby securing their personal and sensitive information. Despite the visibility and traceability of transactions on the blockchain, users identity remains private.\nDecentralization: Self-custody aligns with the principles of decentralization; it empowers individuals by removing the need for intermediaries, and promotes the distribution of power and authority away from centralized entities. Self-custody wallets enable you to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi).\nAutonomy: Self-custody bolsters financial independence by enabling users to manage and transact their assets without third-party constraints, thereby offering enhanced freedom and adaptability. This autonomy also facilitates interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain.\nRead more: The importance of self-custodial staking in Cardano\nSelf-custody represents a significant aspect of the evolving landscape of digital asset management and is considered by many as a crucial component for the future.\nWhile it may not be the only approach, it aligns with the core principles of decentralization, security, and individual empowerment that underpin the crypto industry as a whole.\nWhile self-custody may not be suitable for everyone, it necessitates individuals to assume full responsibility for their security protocols, including the management of private keys and the implementation of protective measures, thereby placing the onus of asset security entirely on the user.\nUltimately, the choice to self-custody depends on the individual s preferences, risk tolerance, and technical capabilities but it is ideal if you are looking to gain control over your own digital assets.\nNow that we have covered the benefits of self-custody, head over to https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/ to take your next step toward financial independence and autonomy.\nAvailable for both desktop and mobile, Yoroi is your gateway to the financial world and the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

It enables artists, creators, and businesses to tokenize assets in the form of NFTs through a simple, no-coding-required platform.\nEMURGO partnered with NMKR to raise commercial awareness and adoption of tokenization services, as it provides new ways for businesses and individuals to harness the power of blockchain technology and digitize their assets for an interested global audience. These tokenized assets can then be stored or transacted as desired using a self-custodial Cardano wallet.\nNMKR Pay is a fiat on-ramp to Cardano projects utilizing the NMKR platform for tokenization. It allows NFT creators to easily integrate a payment gateway for their tokenized asset on Cardano.\nBuyers looking to purchase these NFTs are not required to have Cardano s native cryptocurrency ADA in their crypto wallet to make the purchase.\nIn most cases, new users won t even have the cryptocurrency of a network readily available in a crypto wallet. Normally, they would need to go to a centralized exchange (CEX), log in or sign up, purchase the required cryptocurrency, send it to a wallet that uses the network, and finally make the purchase.\nRelated reading:\nThis long chain of actions poses an entry barrier and dissuades new users from joining a particular blockchain network.

    "input": "",
    "output": "February 20, 2020\nTogether Agency\nCardano a third-generation blockchain based on a scientific, peer-reviewed philosophy utilizes an environmentally-friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol called Ouroboros for its consensus mechanism to achieve the same decentralized security guarantees as Bitcoin a first-generation blockchain.\nA consensus mechanism is how a decentralized blockchain secures its network and transaction records.\nDelegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is another type of blockchain consensus mechanism available today.\nThere are many similarities between DPoS and PoS.\nBoth rely on on-chain resources (i.e. stake in the system) rather than off-chain resources (i.e. hashing power with Bitcoin) to achieve consensus in the network.\nConsensus is important to securing the network and especially important with a decentralized public blockchain where anyone can join the network.\nIn this post, we will look at the specific differences between DPoS and Cardano s PoS system.\nA consensus protocol involves a situation where a group of people has to decide what the state of a system should be.\nAll decentralized blockchains that involve cryptocurrencies have the notion of changing from one state to another state due to evolving data records as time passes since transactions continue to be verified and processed.\nWhen one person transacts with another, there must be a process to transfer that value on the transparent blockchain.\nA consensus algorithm defines how this takes place, and who is involved.\nFirst-generation Bitcoin innovated in a unique way by creating a merit-based lottery system, where parties do work to secure the network, and those who do the work get issued a digital lottery ticket.\nEventually, the winner of the lottery would progress the network by advancing the network from A to B and receive Bitcoin as a reward for their efforts.\nHowever, this is an energy-intensive method that requires the heavy usage of hardware and energy resources such as mining equipment and electricity.\nBoth DPoS and Cardano s PoS achieve this distributed network security but without the use of a mass amount of specialized mining equipment and a large amount of electrical power.\nOuroboros the first provably secure proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is the solid backbone of the Cardano blockchain.\nCardano s native cryptocurrency ada is referred to as stake, and instead of miners (as in Bitcoin) there are ada stakeholders in the Cardano blockchain network.\nCardano s PoS system uses a randomized process to elect a stakeholder to produce a block, based on the weight of the stake recorded in the network.\nA block of time in the Cardano blockchain is an epoch and the individual units of time within an epoch are slots.\nNot all stakeholders have the expertise to produce a block if elected, so stakeholders can pool their resources by delegating their ada stake to stake pools.\nThe managers of these stake pools, known as stake pool operators (SPOs), manage block production during slots where the stake delegated to them is elected by the Cardano Ouroboros algorithm.\nThese rewards are then automatically shared with the stakeholder.\nIn a DPoS system, stakeholders vote on who is responsible for producing blocks.\nThis is different from Cardano s PoS, where the stake is delegated to stake pools rather than used as a voting mechanism.\nThe voting power of each person is weighted to the number of cryptocurrency a person owns.\nThese block producers are responsible for grouping transactions into a block and broadcasting it to the network.\nThese block producers receive rewards for progressing the network.\nDPoS is designed in a way that block producers who fail to perform their duties can be voted out as delegates in elections.\nA DPoS system relies on a fixed amount of delegates to be voted on, meaning there is a set amount of parties allowed to progress the network.\nThis is vastly different from Cardano, as network simulations on the Cardano blockchain have shown that Cardano s blockchain can effectively operate with thousands of running pools which ultimately creates a more distributed, decentralized, and secure network.\nCardano blockchain explorers can transmit and reflect this data about transactions, stake pools, and other Cardano blockchain data in real time.\nMore: What is a blockchain explorer?\nBoth Cardano PoS and DPoS systems require synchronizing with the blockchain in order to participate.\nIn a PoS system, a long-range attack can potentially take place when a bad actor silently produces a very long chain that forks from the blockchain far in the past, resulting in confusion when nodes (servers running a copy of the blockchain) are presented with a chain that is potentially even longer than the real one.\nCardano s solution to this is known as Bootstrapping From Genesis, in which the chain which is densest is always chosen.\nThis is the chain with the most level of participation and transactions. This was introduced into Cardano with the launch of the Shelley mainnet.\nA helpful metaphor for Bootstrapping from Genesis is to think of a fork in the road with a driver needing to decide which road to drive down. Each road represents a copy of the blockchain.\nIn Bitcoin, the longest road is always the correct road, because it required a lot of energy and work to pave the road, which an attacker cannot simply reproduce.\nBootstrapping from Genesis means the road with the most amount of cars on it, people crossing, and overall participation is the one chosen over a longer road that looks to be abandoned.\nIn a DPoS system, the blockchain with the highest block producer participation is chosen.\nA block producer operating alone is assumed to have a lower participation rate than the majority.\nThere is nothing that a dishonest minority can do to replicate a blockchain with a higher participation rate than the main blockchain with a higher participation rate.\nIn DPoS if the network fragments, the longest chain will be the one that achieves consensus.\nCardano s Ouroboros protocol was designed with the philosophy that the ones who own the ada cryptocurrency are the ones ultimately best placed to decide a good outcome for the Cardano system.\nThis is because the owners of the ada cryptocurrency are seen to have a stake in the system.\nBad actors in the network who try to distort the system will see their actions reflected in the price of the blockchain, meaning it is not in their best interest to go against consensus rules.\nFurthermore, Cardano s PoS protocol is not susceptible to external forces such as hashing power, where a more powerful adversary can take down a system through superior energy resources.\nDPoS is designed with a similar philosophy in that those responsible for maintaining the system should be those who have the greatest incentive for its continuation.\nDPoS requires a select number of parties voted by stakeholders to continue the network, as opposed to Cardano s PoS system in which anyone has the potential power to validate blocks of transactions.\nThese are the fundamental differences between Cardano s PoS and a DPoS blockchain.\nCardano s PoS will allow a more distributed and decentralized blockchain than DPoS, due to the higher number of block producers.\nThis decentralization enables distributed trust from a single point of weakness to a much more secure set of actors that distributively and collaboratively produce the same service.\nThis results in a better and more robust, secure blockchain network.\nDownload Yoroi Wallet here\nDeveloped by EMURGO, Yoroi is an open-source crypto light wallet for Cardano ada cryptocurrency holders to easily participate in staking on the Cardano blockchain.\nThrough the Yoroi dashboard, ada users can stake their ada to secure Cardano s network.\nYoroi is available for mobile and desktop browsers and enables Cardano ada users to interact with the Cardano dApp ecosystem of dApps including the $USDA stablecoin.\nAbout EMURGO\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

Each Committee decides how to add new people to its ranks. Some do so via applications, while others do so via invitation.\nEach committee has a dedicated open Discord channel where anyone in the Cardano community can interact with members.\nJoin the Intersect Discord channel\nAt the moment, there are seven committees:\nEach committee is in charge of several Working Groups (explained below) to whom they assign certain tasks and a timeframe for completion.\nThe list varies as some Working Groups cease to exist after completing their assigned work, and others are created to solve new problems. Generally, the Technical Working Groups are aligned with similar Standing Committees, while the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) also work with the non-technical Committees.\nRelated reading:\nCompared to the Committees, the Working Groups are more accessible to the average community member. They are arranged around a specific topic and are assigned tasks that must be delivered within a certain time frame. They are divided into two categories:\nThese are groups familiar with the technical aspects of implementing a blockchain network, including cryptography, the topology of the nodes, transaction size, etc.\nThese groups get specific tasks or deliverables and a set deadline from a Committee by which they must complete the given objectives. In some cases, this may require the allocation of a budget.\nThese Working Groups are open to anyone in Cardano. However, their technical nature makes them more suitable for community members with a deep background in Computer Science, Network engineering, or similar fields.\nOthers can still join and use the meetings to learn more about Cardano, but it would take time before they could meaningfully contribute technically to finishing a product.\nThese are groups that tackle other important operations that could be more technical. These could be translations, marketing, business development, and other related activities. Each one is under the wing of an Intersect Committee, which can assign a task to an SIG. At that point, the SIG becomes a Working Group.\nOnce the members have finished their task, their status as a Working Group ends, and they return to being a SIG. For example, a language allocation SIG can be given the task of translating Intersect s documentation to Japanese.\nIn this case, the SIG is renamed the Japanese Translation Working Group (or something similar) and begins its task. After they finish translating, they return to the original SIG until they are given a new objective.\nAny Member can request to be part of a Working Group by contacting them through their Discord channel.\nJoin Intersect now and start shaping Cardano governance\nTo receive more information on Cardano governance and Intersect, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Takeaways from the Cardano Constitutional Convention EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "December 18, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe highly anticipated Cardano Constitutional Convention, a milestone event for the Cardano blockchain network and its global community, successfully concluded to mark its trailblazing journey toward fully decentralized governance.\nOver three days in early December, the Cardano Constitutional Convention was held across two continents in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Nairobi, Kenya and also broadcast via a livestream for the community. The Cardano Constitutional Convention was the culmination of more than a year of global workshops, discussions, and educational initiatives aimed at empowering the community to shape Cardano s future governance. Through these various efforts, the community provided detailed feedback which helped to draft the first-ever Cardano Constitution.\nFor those who were unable to attend or view the highlights from the event, this blog will recap the 5 biggest takeaways from the Cardano Constitutional Convention and discuss the next steps ahead for the Cardano blockchain network.\nThe start of Cardano s path toward fully distributed governance can be traced back to the release of CIP-1694, a Cardano Improvement Proposal put forth by the community detailing proposed governance policies, features, bodies, and more.\nThis kickstarted the process of discussing a Minimum Viable Government that could support community decision-making abilities for the network and was also accompanied by a series of global workshops supported by Intersect to enable the community to further discuss and debate the proposals made in CIP-1694 and guide the development of the Cardano Constitution.\nThe idea behind the Cardano Constitution is to formally outline the different governance mechanisms, institutions, and responsibilities of all the community members within the Cardano ecosystem. Similar to the Constitution of a sovereign nation, it serves as a cornerstone to guide and anchor all of the other processes and developments related to the Cardano network.\nThis led to the planning of the first Cardano Constitutional Convention to bring selected community delegates and other key community stakeholders together to draft and present an official Constitution for community ratification.\nRelated reading:\nHere are five highlights to consider.\nThere were several scheduled talks and workshops in both Argentina and Kenya for the Cardano Constitutional Convention.\nSpeakers focused on how governance-related matters will consistently need to be discussed and developed to uphold the future sustainability of Cardano. There is much community work needed on new governance tools and educational resources, and to further expand Intersect to onboard more community members that can provide an active voice in many different governance-related tasks.\nSource: https://x.com/IntersectMBO/status/1864735393079525883/photo/1\nDelegates to the Cardano Constitutional Convention gathered in both cities to discuss the different aspects of the drafting of the Constitution. Taking into account feedback from various global workshops in their respective local communities, each delegate brought their own viewpoints.\nThere were 450 attendees with 63 elected delegates. They were separated into groups during the following days to discuss and debate the aspects of the Constitution drafting. Each helped improve the draft text before being presented as a whole for approval.\nOn the final day of the delegate debates, the Constitution draft text was put to a delegate vote. The result was that the draft was approved by 95 of the delegates.\nThere were no abstentions from the final vote, giving the draft an overwhelming approval margin. This cleared the draft for the signing ceremony and then to hand it over to the DReps (delegate representatives) for an on-chain vote for ratification.\nRead more: Explaining DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee\nSource: https://x.com/IntersectMBO/status/1864274151847973013/photo/1\nOn December 6, all of the delegates in Argentina got together at the University of Buenos Aires for the official signing ceremony. Each of the delegates would sign the approved Constitutional draft.\nIt started with Charles Hoskinson providing the first signature.\nAfterward, the delegates each signed the draft with their alternate as witnesses. This finalized the delegates approval of the Constitutional draft, which was made public during the event.\nSource: https://x.com/InputOutputHK/status/1865163496712773827\nWith the Cardano Constitution draft having been signed and approved by the delegates, one of the major next steps for the Cardano network is to implement the second part of its Chang Hard Fork, which will give DReps and the community voting power for governance proposals. This is crucial as the Cardano Constitution has to be ratified by the global community and voted on-chain.\nOnce Chang Hard Fork Part 2 is implemented, the community will have the ability to vote on the Constitution and finalize the ratification process. The date for the hard fork is expected sometime soon.\nRead more: What is the Chang Hard Fork?\nIf the timetable holds, the general on-chain vote will happen during the first months of 2025.

    "instruction": "Here Are 5 Benefits of Blockchain Interoperability EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "November 5, 2024\nEMURGO\nBefore blockchain technology became more well-known, there was a common belief that suggested that only one blockchain network would ultimately prevail, becoming the dominant platform for all user needs.\nThe idea was that competition between differing blockchain networks would lead to a winner-takes-all scenario, with everyone coming to eventually rely on a single, universal blockchain network.\nHowever, more are now coming to believe that multiple blockchain networks will coexist, each excelling in different strengths. Instead of one network dominating, a Web3-driven future will likely involve a diverse ecosystem of specialized blockchains.\nIn this evolving landscape, the need for blockchain interoperability the ability for different networks to communicate and work together has become increasingly important. Networks that can interact and communicate with others are better positioned to thrive in a Web3 future with many decentralized applications being built on different blockchains.\nHere, we will discuss the five key benefits of blockchain interoperability.\nA (decentralized) blockchain network is a distributed ledger that is updated and shared in real time between nodes or servers that anyone can choose to run.\nThose electing to run a node use the network s consensus algorithm to agree on the rules governing the network such as user transaction verification. A greater number of nodes participating helps to further decentralize and secure the network. For their contributions, these participants are typically rewarded in the network s native cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin uses a consensus method called Proof-of-Work (PoW), where participants or miners compete to validate user transactions and add them to the ledger in return for Bitcoin.\nThe Cardano blockchain uses a different consensus mechanism known as Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). In Cardano, participants or validators are selected to validate transactions based on the amount of staking power blockchain users are delegating to the network s staking pools.\nThe unique value of decentralized blockchain networks lies in their ability to operate without a centralized authority by utilizing the network s consensus algorithm. This allows blockchains to create secure and decentralized networks that can provide verified and transparent trust between their users.\nRead more: 5 tips to become a Cardano blockchain developer\nThe number of blockchain networks and the various Web3 applications built on them have grown in adoption over the years. This has led to a greater awareness and push to enable these different blockchain networks to be interoperable or interact with each other, connecting users with applications and products on another network.\nIn the beginning, several blockchains operated as closed systems to maintain the consistency and security of their own networks. However, this closed-off approach also limited their ability to let users interact with other networks.\nGreater awareness and demand for interoperability started partly due to the rising interest in decentralized finance (DeFi). More and more users preferred interoperable blockchains to exchange assets directly without relying on centralized solutions, such as exchanges. Early solutions included atomic swaps which enable direct, trustless exchanges of tokens from different blockchains. Today, interoperability typically involves the usage of technical bridges between networks.\nSome of these bridges include:\nAs the blockchain industry continues to evolve, interoperability will become increasingly crucial. Blockchains that can communicate quickly, cost-effectively, and securely with other networks will hold a significant advantage over networks that remain closed.\nRead more: EMURGO partners with Zilliqa Group to enhance network interoperability\nLet s go over some examples of what interoperability can bring to a network:\nOne challenge is the issue of fragmented liquidity where certain assets are not interoperable between networks. For example, a stablecoin issued on a specific blockchain network can be exclusive to that network and unable to be used on another due to a lack of interoperability.\nThis leads blockchains to increasingly compete against each other for liquidity and an imbalance of network resources. Interoperability can potentially solve this problem by enabling tokens to move more efficiently between different networks and thereby enhance liquidity. This opens access to a wider range of applications for users.\nAs Web3 developers strive to launch decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain networks to reach a broader audience, they often encounter challenges with token management. Many of these dApps issue their own tokens, which need to be minted and managed on separate blockchain networks where the dApp operates which is a complex and resource-intensive task.\nCross-chain assets can potentially address this issue by allowing developers to maintain a shared pool of tokens that can move between different networks. Developers can manage a single pool of tokens rather than having to deal with separate pools of tokens on different networks. This approach can make it easier and more efficient for developers to achieve their objectives and ensure a consistent supply across various networks.\nNFTs also have the potential to be adopted more widely with greater interoperability. The media associated with them, in most cases, is already in a decentralized storage network. In some cases, the metadata of the NFT is also external to the blockchain. A cross-chain NFT would allow a network to migrate the metadata on the NFT from the original blockchain to a new one. This opens new use cases where NFTs can be bridged and retain their uniqueness between several different blockchains.\nThis could be especially powerful for real-world tokenized assets (RWAs). Much like with many other digital assets, RWAs cannot be in two networks at the same time creating a zero-sum game. Interoperability allows these tokens to quickly move from one chain to the other and expand use cases for the tokens.\nOracles can enhance interoperability and contribute to a more interconnected experience for dApp users and developers by enabling much-needed data exchange between blockchains.\nBlockchains are typically closed systems where they are unable to directly access external information outside of their respective networks. To bridge this gap, oracles are used to connect outside data to a particular blockchain network.\nOracles can also facilitate communication between different blockchains. For example, oracles can help send information from one blockchain to another. Oracles are capable of supporting cross-chain messaging which makes interoperable ones more preferable than oracles limited to a single network.\nBlockchain application users and developers are increasingly wanting the ability to make payments using tokens from different networks. These sorts of cross-chain payments enable users to spend tokens from one blockchain as payment within a dApp on another blockchain.\nThis interoperability can also extend to using tokens from one network as collateral on a different blockchain. With more flexibility regarding cross-chain payments and the use of collateral across networks, users can interact more with DeFi applications on a different blockchain without first needing to purchase its native cryptocurrency or tokens.\nInteroperability can enhance the economic security of a blockchain network by diversifying its assets, and users, and adding liquidity. When a blockchain can connect and collaborate with multiple networks, it reduces the risk of economic vulnerabilities that may arise from being closed off with a lack of users and needed liquidity.\nWith more assets, users, and liquidity in a network providing greater security due to interoperability, developers and users can be naturally incentivized to build and adopt more products and services on that particular network.\nThis can not only strengthen the overall stability of individual blockchains but also contribute to a more secure blockchain ecosystem as a whole through increased adoption.\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to receive regular blog content on blockchain and Web3-related topics.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Things to Consider When Launching a Cardano NFT Collection EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "November 14, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs are unique digital tokens that can be launched as part of a collection with a specific theme or concept that appeals to a particular audience.\nThey can also be used to digitally represent real-world assets, images, video clips, and other media types. NFTs were one of the first types of tokens to become popular within the Cardano ecosystem.\nNFTs and their collections are among the simplest crypto projects to create on a blockchain, making them ideal starting points for small teams or individuals seeking to develop more advanced Web3 products or fund desired initiatives.\nThus, for newcomers to the blockchain industry, creating an NFT collection offers an accessible entry point.\nIn this guide, here are five things to consider before creating and launching a Cardano NFT collection.\nTo start, every Cardano NFT collection needs a compelling theme to shape its identity and messaging. This theme is reflected in two main parts of each NFT: the media and the token s metadata.\nFor the media, the theme defines the visual style of the collection, which can be expressed through images, animations, or videos. In the token s metadata, the theme guides the description accompanying each token, adding context and appeal.\nImages for the collection can be commissioned from artists or generated with increasingly popular AI tools. However, project developers using AI should ensure that generated images are available for commercial use, as some platforms require subscriptions or fees for commercial rights.\nNext, the token s characteristics are an important factor.\nThe first question to address is: how many NFTs will be included in the collection? The number should strike a balance too large a supply can compromise the token s scarcity, while too small a supply may hinder discoverability.\nAn ideal number strikes a nice balance allowing creators to generate revenue without oversaturating the market.\nAnother key factor is the NFT s utility. In some cases, an NFT may play a significant role within a broader platform or ecosystem. Utilities can include features like early access to new functionalities, trading discounts, revenue sharing, or membership benefits for DAOs.\nPromoting the project should prioritize highlighting any utility associated with the NFT. Many buyers are drawn to projects where the token serves a purpose within a larger ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of specific utilities.\nOn Cardano, for example, popular DEXs use NFTs as cards that provide discounts to traders while DAO tooling projects such as ClarityDAO use NFTs for membership tokens. These are some examples of use cases in the ecosystem.\nThe next step is to create the token s metadata template for the entire collection. This template describes each token, providing essential information such as its nature, supply, collection name, and other relevant details.\nFor NFTs issued on Cardano, the token s metadata can be stored directly on-chain and add more textual data than those issued on other chains. This information is important for holding relevant information about the asset that has been tokenized as an NFT and enabling buyers to view it transparently.\nWithin the metadata, projects can also specify a royalty percentage. This means that every time the token is resold on the market, a percentage of the sale price could return to the creators as royalties. This mechanism allows projects to generate long-term revenue, contributing to their sustainability.\nRelated reading:\nSince the media component of the NFT is typically not stored on-chain, a reliable storage solution is necessary. Most projects choose to utilize decentralized storage networks such as IPFS or Iagon to host their images or other media files.\nWhen selecting a storage solution, key considerations include the cost of storage and the frequency of payment for the service. Most networks offer subscription models for ongoing storage, while some provide permanent storage options for a one-time larger payment. Project owners should carefully evaluate these costs to determine which solution best suits their needs.\nNMKR Studio provides the option to select IPFS or Iagon, two popular solutions for decentralized storage. Each can be accessed directly from NMKR s platform and integrated into a project from the same menu.\nFinally, it s time to sell the NFTs to other users. At this stage, project creators have two primary options:\n1) Launch a new platform where buyers can mint the NFTs directly.\n2) Use an existing platform that offers minting services.\nIn most cases, the second option is the most advantageous for an NFT collection. Existing platforms can streamline the process, resulting in a quicker project turnaround while minimizing costs.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization platform utilizing the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses, individuals, Web3 projects, and developers to easily mint NFTs for trading without requiring coding skills.\nBy removing many technical barriers to creating Cardano NFTs, NMKR has closed the technological gap and broadened accessibility to a wider segment of potential users. Thus, those who use its platform can focus on the utility and design of the NFT collection and leave all the technological heavy lifting to the NMKR Studio platform.\nInterested in discovering more business use cases for NFTs, such as real-world asset tokenization?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Things to Expect in Chang Hard Fork Part 2 Cardano EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "October 29, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe Cardano blockchain s Chang Hard Fork has been a pivotal two-part upgrade to enhance network functionality and decentralized governance. Earlier this year, the first part of this upgrade went live, delivering critical improvements like burning the genesis keys, granting voting power to the Interim Constitutional Committee, and embedding the hash of the Interim Cardano Constitution on-chain. These upgrades marked a significant step forward, empowering Cardano s community to shape the network s future.\nA blockchain hard fork updates the software across the distributed network of nodes that validate and secure the blockchain. As each node follows the protocol that governs the network, it must adopt the upgrade to continue operating. Hard forks enable new functionalities, bolster security, and streamline network operations, among other benefits.\nNow, with the first part completed, the second phase of the Chang Hard Fork promises to bring even more advancements to Cardano that will enable the community to shape its future. While some of these enhancements will roll out in this second stage, others are set to launch with the ratification of the upcoming official Cardano Constitution.\nLet s dive into five major updates expected in Cardano s Chang Hard Fork Part 2.\nThe second phase of Cardano s Chang Hard Fork will introduce Delegate Representative (DRep) Voting, a crucial step in empowering Cardano s decentralized governance model. DReps will serve as one of the three primary governing bodies in Cardano s future governance structure, providing a mechanism for community-driven decision-making. Once fully integrated, DReps will have the authority to vote on proposals and governance actions submitted by the Cardano community. This makes their role essential for representing the voice of ADA holders on the network.\nRegistration to become a DRep is currently open. A one-time deposit of 500 ADA is required to obtain an on-chain DRep certificate, officially designating them as registered members. Cardano s Gov Tools website also facilitates DRep registration, simplifying the process for new participants.\nEncouraging community participation is essential, as each DRep s voting power depends on the amount of ADA delegated to them. To maximize influence, DReps should start actively engaging with ADA holders and building support as soon as possible. By doing so, they can secure delegations and play a substantial role in shaping the future of Cardano through collective decision-making.\nRelated reading:\nA key upgrade in Chang Part 2 will be SPO (Stake Pool Operator) voting. As a core governing body on the Cardano network, SPOs represent the community segment that supports the network s infrastructure. With this update, SPOs can soon leverage the ADA delegated to their pools as voting power. This means they, like DReps, can vote to approve or reject community-proposed governance actions, helping shape Cardano s future.\nSPOs influence will hinge on the amount of ADA delegated to them, making it vital to sustain delegation levels and communicate their decisions transparently to delegators. This addition will transform the role of SPOs, allowing them to play an active part in Cardano s move toward decentralized governance.\nA key feature of Cardano s decentralized governance model is governing actions proposals anyone in the Cardano community can submit. Once Chang Hard Fork Part 2 is implemented, ADA holders will be empowered to create governance actions, fostering community-led changes. To initiate a proposal, ADA holders must make a small ADA deposit, which is fully refunded after voting ends, regardless of the result.\nRead more: Explaining Cardano s governing bodies\nGoverning actions are central to Cardano s transition to a decentralized future. These actions are subject to voting by Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and Delegate Representatives (DReps), ensuring that decisions reflect the Cardano community s vision. Through these mechanisms, Cardano is truly placing control in the hands of ADA holders, further strengthening its decentralized governance framework.\nFor governing actions to be impactful, they require a budget and Chang Part 2 will introduce a treasury withdrawal system tied to successful votes. When the Cardano community approves a governing action, funding will be allocated directly from Cardano s treasury to bring these initiatives to life.\nThis mechanism enables ADA holders to actively shape how treasury funds promote network growth. Rather than merely serving as suggestions, these governing actions become actionable, community-driven projects with dedicated resources for execution. In this way, Cardano s treasury becomes a vital tool for realizing the community s vision and expanding the network.\nWith the completion of Chang Part 2, the Constitutional Committee will be able to expand, allowing for greater representation across the Cardano community. Currently, the interim Committee is limited to a fixed membership of seven. Still, this upgrade will open the door to additional members, ensuring broader input and diversity, especially when the committee exercises veto power.\nThe expanded committee will welcome individual members as well as representatives from companies, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), NGOs, and other groups within Cardano. Each entity can appoint a representative to participate in the Constitutional Committee s operations, adding a potential new layer of inclusivity to Cardano s decentralized governance framework.\nLooking to stay up-to-date and learn more about Cardano community governance?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for regular updates and related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "What to Know About the Chang Hard Fork Cardano EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "July 17, 2024\nEMURGO\nUpdate:\nAs part of the first upgrade of the Chang Hard Fork, the Cardano genesis keys have been burned. The process was triggered on September 1st and kickstarted the Conway Era in epoch 507. Hard forks will now be able to be triggered by a governance action proposed by the community. Governance bodies such as SPOs and DReps will vote on the proposed changes and the Constitutional Committee shall decide whether to use or not its veto power. These functions will be introduced through the second upgrade of the Chang Hard Fork.\nA blockchain hard fork is essentially an upgrade in the software run by the distributed nodes (servers) that validate and secure the network. As decentralized blockchains are governed by a set of rules (protocol) followed by each participant in the network, each node will have to implement the upgrade to continue playing its role.\nA hard fork can deliver new functions and features to the network and improve security, among other benefits.\nIn Cardano, a hark fork is delivered via a hard fork combinator (HFC), ensuring a smooth transition during the upgrade to a new protocol. In other blockchains, a hard fork can potentially result in network downtime and other inconveniences. For the Chang Hard Fork, at least 70 of stake pool operators (SPOs) will need to upgrade to the new node version and 80 of exchange liquidity will need to be ready.\nThis will mark the first step towards a minimum-viable community-run governance structure outlined in CIP-1694, meaning that the Cardano community will be responsible for maintaining and shaping the blockchain network. It will be instituted with the consent of the community, including network SPOs.\nThe Chang Hard Fork is a technical component of the Voltaire era of the Cardano roadmap, which focuses on implementing a sustainable and distributed governance framework. With the first part set to be initiated in July 2024, the next part of the Hard Fork upgrade is set to happen by Q4 of this year.\nPart one of the hard fork aids the transition to a fully community-governed blockchain network and the entrance into a technical bootstrapping phase. Due to its complexity and the involvement of many community stakeholders, Cardano s distributed governance will take time to implement completely. While the network is in this process of transformation, temporary governance institutions will support the transition.\nFirst, the Interim Cardano Constitution is released by Cardano s off-chain governance organization Intersect. It s a guiding document that will give guardrails during the transition period. It is meant to be a bridge to the actual Constitution, which is set to be drafted and ratified by the community at the Cardano Constitutional Convention later in the year.\nRead more: What does Intersect do for Cardano governance?\nDuring this first upgrade of the Chang Hard Fork, the hash of this interim constitution will be included as part of the new node version (Cardano Node 9.0.0), which supports entering the bootstrapping phase of CIP-1694 and is to be implemented by all network participants. This will ensure the text s integrity and serve as a trial for when the full Constitution is ratified.\nSecond, Intersect has opened the Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC). This temporary governance body will uphold the principles of the interim Constitution and vote on the first on-chain governance actions. The committee will have seven members during its existence, including three elected by the community.\nThis interim body will have a veto power that will be enacted via on-chain voting and introduced as part of the Chang Hard Fork.\nThe second part will introduce several of the final upgrades needed for full community-run governance. It s a more complex piece than Part One and is expected to happen in Q4 of 2024. It ll mark the start of full-force decentralized governance and the exit from a technical bootstrapping phase.\nPart Two will introduce the Delegate Representatives (DReps) as a governance body. The DReps can register and generate a certificate, request ADA delegations, and vote on governance proposals. All these functions will be part of the Cardano network.\nRead more: Explaining the governance bodies in Cardano\nSecond, SPOs voting on governance actions will be possible. They will have the chance to use their delegated ADA as voting power. This will give them the chance to approve or reject governance actions.\nThird, the Constitutional Committee will be online. This body will be able to grow its membership past the seven of the interim committee. It ll also have full veto power on all governance actions the group finds contradict the constitution.\nFinally, the community will then be in charge of treasury withdrawals. Cardano users will be able to propose treasury debits via governance actions. The three bodies (Constitutional Committee, DReps, and SPOs) will vote on them, and if approved, ADA will be moved out of the treasury.\nFrom that point forward, the future of the Cardano blockchain will be in the hands of its community, along with its power to draft and ratify the Cardano Constitution. This will mark a monumental step not only for the network but also for the blockchain industry as a whole, as Cardano will be the first truly distributed and community-run blockchain network.\nWant to receive more essential information about Cardano updates, courses, and related events?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to stay up-to-date.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "August 20, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe road to the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is starting to reach its destination.\nPlanned for the end of the year, the gathering will mark a milestone for the Cardano blockchain as a community-drafted version of the Cardano Constitution will be presented and voted upon for ratification to officially implement a distributed governance framework.\nThe wheels to community-run governance have already been in motion for the Cardano network, starting with CIP-1694, which outlines proposals for Cardano s on-chain governance functions and features. Intersect, a member-based organization open to all, has also been launched and is working to support governance by organizing community workshops, forming various groups and committees, and assigning important governance-related tasks to interested parties.\nDuring this transitional period leading up to the Constitutional Convention, the Cardano network requires temporary governance functions and features to bridge the gap between the present and the official ratification of the Constitution. An interim Constitutional Committee and a provisional interim Cardano Constitution have been formed to address this need.\nThis blog will cover more about Cardano s interim Constitutional Committee and Constitution.\nRead more: View the interim Constitution.\nThe formation of a temporary or interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) has been approved to bootstrap Cardano s governance era. This body will have all of the duties of the full Constitutional Committee after the second upgrade of the Cardano blockchain s Chang Hard Fork. The ICC has been elected for a minimum of 73 epochs in the Cardano network.\nOriginally, the Cardano blockchain had managed its technical updates via a group of genesis keys. A majority of the keys were needed to push a new hard fork to the network and begin the process of adoption by the stake pools.\nHowever, after the Chang Hard Fork, there will be seven votes belonging to the members of the ICC, including those from the community, Intersect, EMURGO, IO (Input Output), and Cardano Foundation.\nThe members of this temporary body won t receive any remuneration for being part of the ICC, but they will assist in guiding the Cardano network towards ratification of the Constitution, among other things.\nRecently, a few members of the ICC took part as individual participants in the first Cardano Constitutional Workshop held in Berlin, Germany on July 28, 2024, to explore community input about selected key topics related to the drafting of the Constitution.\nRelated reading:\nOf course, if there isn t a Constitution, there would be nothing for a Constitutional Committee to uphold. As with the ICC, there is also an interim Cardano Constitution to bridge the gap until its official ratification.\nThe text of this document has been drafted by the Civics Committee of Intersect.\nThe interim Constitution will also be added on-chain during the first upgrade of the Chang Hard Fork. The entire text will be hashed and added to every updated node in the Cardano network to ensure the integrity of the interim Constitution.\nOnce the official Constitution is drafted and ratified, it ll also be hashed and added on-chain to the Cardano network. The text of the interim Constitution can be found here.\nDuring the first Constitutional workshop held last month, the community discussed specific topics related to the drafting of the document including financial sustainability, voting rights, principles and tenets, and budget allocations.\nMore workshops are scheduled globally throughout August and September in the lead-up to the Cardano Constitutional Convention.

    "instruction": "5 NFT Use Cases for Data Beyond Traditional Images EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "September 12, 2024\nEMURGO\nWhen NFTs (non-fungible tokens) became a prominent trend a few years ago, they were mostly known by the mainstream as a type of digital art or image that somehow used blockchain technology to create and store them.\nFor most people, the image and the NFT were the same.\nHowever, this perception oversimplifies its range of unique properties. Images are in fact, just one type of file that can be linked to it. They can digitally store and represent much more than just image files.\nIn this blog, we will discuss 5 other data types that can be minted as NFTs beyond just simple images.\nAn NFT is a digital token issued by and recorded on a blockchain network with a unique ID. This identifier makes it possible to differentiate one token from another as they are transacted over the network. They typically represent some type of asset to make it easier to store, trade, and authenticate in the digital world.\nNFTs can be minted or created using a platform service such as NMKR and the token itself can be stored within crypto wallets.\nIn the Cardano blockchain, an NFT is identified by the Policy ID which gives it a unique cryptographic fingerprint and value on-chain. This can be used for a single token, or for a token collection where each token shares the same identifier but with unique names.\nThe URL of the associated media type is recorded in the metadata of the token. In most cases, it points to a distributed storage network that records it. The images of NFTs are in these networks, but they can store more than just an image.\nA sound recording can be recorded on a decentralized storage network similar to an image file. All the properties associated with visual data would also apply here.\nAn example can be sound effects.\nMany sound engineers create sound effects which then can be used for videos, movies, games, etc. In this case, the NFT of the sound effect could be used to represent and enable the purchase of its license so that it may be incorporated into other works.\nAnother example is music.\nMany musicians have found traditional streaming services to provide royalties that are too insignificant to reasonably sustain a music career. NFTs representing songs and music albums could be used to market individual songs directly to consumers and potentially provide higher royalties along with integrated payment options.\nRelated reading:\nPeople live in a world where satellite-based real-time maps provide coverage of nearly any location on Earth. Smartphones equipped with mapping applications give access to people to find certain places, connect and share specific location-based information with others, and more.\nBeyond just general maps, this comprehensive coverage has been used for applications such as mapping farmland, oil fields, city planning, and even games.\nNFTs can take a certain location on a map and make them unique. The metadata can create a collectible based on a location which then gives rewards to the person reaching a certain destination.\nThis function can be then used to create location-based campaigns and services within games, exercise apps, and many other business or recreational activities to incentivize users to go to certain locations.\nLegal agreements or contracts that bind two or more parties into a set of rules and stipulations can also be represented and recorded on-chain as an NFT. These would direct the outcomes based on certain conditions happening in the world.\nThis means each NFT would contain a text file that is recorded on a distributed storage network. The blockchain network that issues the NFT would have the ability to read token metadata and assign outcomes based on the information.\nA contract deployed using an NFT would not only be a legal agreement, but it would also be self-executable logic that enforces results based on conditions that are met thereby creating faster business operations and enhanced transparency.\nToday s online games are populated by thousands of items. Each of these goods plays a role in the game s mechanics. These attributes are contained in a server and are kept there under the control of a few hands.\nAn NFT can represent an in-game item and also contain the attributes of it in the metadata. The metadata can be mutable or immutable, it would be up to the game developer, but everyone would be aware of any changes made.\nThe combination of in-game items and NFTs with versatile metadata can create a new level of utility for games at large. Blockchain provides a secure medium and options for those developing a game while providing security to gamers.\nEach NFT can also represent a piece of a large film, an episode of a series, a short film, or in some cases, an issue of a comic where turning the page is an animated action.\nThe NFT can then be used to access this film or animation and watch it or purchase it. This allows the owner to resell it later on NTF marketplaces if they no longer desire access to the media.\nThis can open a new type of distribution for those looking to create and distribute short-form film media to content creators or other media-related businesses.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily create NFTs by providing tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established platform, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets.\nIts various products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support enable businesses and individuals to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even provide traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nWant to learn more about NFTs and their use cases beyond just images?

    "instruction": "Why Cardano is Ideal for Sustainable Web3 Adoption Part 1?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "September 6, 2022\nAlbert Kim\nThis is the first part of a two-part blog series on Cardano and sustainable Web3 adoption.\nIn this blog, we will answer the fundamental questions:\nIn the second part, we will discuss why Cardano is the sustainable answer to picking a blockchain platform for Web3 solutions & services such as Cardano NFTs, Cardano DeFi, and other Cardano dApps.\nIf you re a Web3 developer or blockchain startup considering L1 or layer-one blockchains to build upon, Cardano offers one of the largest proof-of-stake blockchains with a community of over 3.8 million active ADA wallet addresses and an environmentally-friendly blockchain that is significantly more energy-efficient than other alternatives.\nThe history of the modern Internet can be generally divided into three eras: Web1, Web2, and now Web3.\nWeb1 spans the early 90s to 2005, covering the advent of the home PC and Internet boom years. People started to become familiar with the concept of the Internet and the World Wide Web as PCs became mainstream. Internet speeds were slow with dial-up modems but became faster with the availability of broadband Internet towards the end of the Web1 era.\nWeb1 was about offering Internet users the ability to read-only or view-only content on mostly centralized, closed-source platforms without the ability to post user-generated content due to a myriad of factors: slow Internet speeds, usage of closed-source technology like Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), and lack of content variety, among others.\nHowever, it was difficult for average Internet users to find a broad range of content, create content, and monetize their content due to the factors listed above.\nAs technology continued to develop, the modern Internet transitioned into the Web2 era, generally characterized as covering 2005 to 2020. In Web2, Internet usage became more affordable and expanded to become commonly used throughout the globe. Smartphones and wireless Internet technology (WiFi) were also introduced and quickly became ubiquitous. By Web2, Internet users were accustomed to using high-speed broadband Internet for their PCs and smartphones.\nWeb2 provided Internet users the ability to not only read content, but also write and create content. Online platforms for user websites, blogs, videos, and other tools and services became accessible for Internet users to create their content for others to engage with, and also monetize. Social media platforms also started to take off and gain billions of users worldwide keen on uploading their pictures, videos, and written content. However, these platforms for user-generated content were all centralized under the control of private entities. This meant that while users were able to create and monetize their content, the centralized platforms had final control over the usage of their uploaded content and personal information.\nIn response to many of the drawbacks of Web1 and Web2, blockchain technology and its open-source properties started gaining popularity. Initially, it was more commonly known as the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies through Bitcoin s release in 2009. However, blockchain and its potential use cases started to expand in development towards the end of the next decade, sparking the transition to the Web3 era (2020 onwards).\nIn Web3, Internet users can read, write/create, and own and earn through their creative content while also having full control over their personal identity information. This is made possible by using open-source decentralized applications (dApps) running on top of decentralized blockchain platforms. These blockchain platforms are open-source and anybody can contribute to their development and upkeep. dApps are applications that meet conditions based on algorithms and open-source code without a centralized entity to govern.\nWeb3 developers are fast developing dApps to allow users to transfer financial value, own & transact digital art/music, secure identity, choose what information to share while browsing the Internet, share user-generated content, and so forth, while retaining full control over payments, identity, and content.\nEMURGO can help bridge the technical and knowledge gap when it comes to Cardano and Web3. We can help bring your startup or enterprise into the Cardano ecosystem and Web3.\nAs a founding entity of Cardano, EMURGO possesses the strategic resources to invest, build, and market your Web3 startup or integrate your existing business models into Cardano s Web3 ecosystem.\nEMURGO will also be at the upcoming TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore on September 28-29, 2022 to discuss how Cardano and Web3 can bring value to your project or organization.\nFor questions, please contact marketing@emurgo.io\nAbout EMURGO\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout Fibo\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "input": "",
    "output": "October 3, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens are among the most innovative digital assets to come from blockchain technology. They have created a whole host of business use cases and raised awareness amongst the public about the potential of Web3.\nYet, many are still unfamiliar with the abstract nature of NFTs and find it rather difficult to send, receive, and store them.\nIn this blog, we will look at some of the common ways to address these issues for individual users and those involved with tokenized assets minted on the Cardano blockchain.\nFor NFTs issued or created on the Cardano blockchain network, core developers have created a native asset standard. This makes them similar in properties to fungible tokens or Cardano s native cryptocurrency ADA, and more versatile and easy to send, store, and receive.\nThe process of creating and issuing the NFT on a blockchain is known as minting. For those directly minting on Cardano, it can be a more technical process that requires a Cardano Node (a server connected to the blockchain) and other requirements. Platforms such as NMKR aim to address that barrier by enabling anyone to use their service to tokenize assets by minting Cardano NFTs without having to possess those technical requirements.\nAll information related to the asset in the Cardano NFT is also stored in the token metadata which can store more data than compared to NFTs issued on other chains. Certain Cardano-based wallets such as Yoroi can pull the metadata from the native assets to display the NFT in its intended form in its NFT gallery feature.\nRead more: Swap Cardano native assets in Yoroi Wallet\nFor NFTs minted on Cardano, a self-custodial Cardano ecosystem wallet such as Yoroi (and others) enables users to store and display their NFTs.\nWith Yoroi, there is a desktop web browser and a mobile version available.\nThese wallets allow users to create a private key upon installation. Most of these are considered self-custodial wallets where the user retains control over their stored assets since only they have access to the wallet s private key.\nThese wallets also have NFT gallery functions that allow for a fast search of a user s NFTs to view or trade. That makes them very convenient to connect with and use in NFT marketplaces and other platforms.\nHowever, a potential vulnerability is that the user must be aware of security best practices in safeguarding their digital assets. A user without much experience or knowledge of safely securing their private key could become an attractive target for hackers.\nRead more: Ways to avoid popular scams with Yoroi.\nThis is something to consider since if the private key is breached or lost, there is no way to recover access to the wallet.\nUsers can send and receive Cardano NFTs directly from their Cardano-based wallet such as Yoroi or others with a NFT gallery.\nThese can be sent directly to another person s wallet or another wallet that you own. Others can send NFTs directly to your wallet.\nIt is required that a user must have a Shelley-era Cardano wallet address which indicates it is not an exchange wallet. These wallet addresses start with the prefix addr1 .\nWhen sending a Cardano NFT, users must also have enough ADA to cover the cost of sending the asset. To send, a user must go to the Send function in their wallet, enter the correct wallet address of the recipient and fee amount displayed, and verify their wallet spending password.\nTo receive a Cardano NFT, a user must provide their Shelley-era wallet address to the sender.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service that leverages the Cardano blockchain.\nIt facilitates the tokenization of real-world assets by making the NFT minting process straightforward and user-friendly. Its platform accommodates typical formats like images, videos, and audio. Additionally, it extends support to application files such as HTML, 3D files, and PDFs, providing a comprehensive range of NFT creations.\nOther services such as NMKR Pay enable those minting NFTs to also utilize traditional payment options to streamline the process instead of having to resort to using cryptocurrencies.\nRead more: How businesses can leverage NMKR for NFTs\nWant to learn more about NFTs and their use cases beyond just images?

    "input": "",
    "output": "September 18, 2024\nEMURGO\nSINGAPORE, SEPTEMBER 18, 2024 Cardano is set to welcome the first prominent gold-backed token, Kinka Gold ($XNK), into its blockchain ecosystem. Kinka s gold-backed token will arrive with the close tactical, technical, and strategic support of EMURGO, one of Cardano s founding entities, as a technology provider.\nThe adoption of blockchain tech is continuing at a breakneck pace. More and more financial institutions worldwide are recognizing the vital importance of on-chain economies and their disruptive potential on global money markets, particularly in the case of representative and reserve-backed tokens.\nKinka is a subsidiary of UNBANKED, INC., a publicly-listed neofinance services company in Japan that is opening up access to on-chain economies to the world. $XNK is a gold-backed token, with each token representing one ounce of premium Japanese gold that meets all LBMA (London Bullion Market Association) standards. This gold is designated for use on the Osaka Exchange and is securely held in bankruptcy-remote vaults worldwide.\nThe launch of the first gold-backed token can serve as a catalyst for other real-world asset (RWA) tokens, while also offering a stable gold-pegged currency suitable for use in jurisdictions where fiat-backed stablecoins fall outside regulatory frameworks. Additionally, it potentially opens avenues for increasing the liquidity and use cases of gold by integrating the yellow metal into Cardano s broader DeFi ecosystem, including lending, collateral, and payment use cases.\nEMURGO is deeply committed to advancing the utility of Cardano and Web3 technologies in real-world applications. Our collaboration with Kinka to support the technological foundation of a gold-backed digital asset on the Cardano blockchain helps bridge the gap between traditional assets and the blockchain.

    "instruction": "Yoroi Wallet 101 How to Send and Receive Cardano ADA?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 14, 2022\nEMURGO\nThe Cardano blockchain had an exciting 2021 filled with new developments, such as the launch of millions of native tokens, and the highly anticipated deployment of smart contracts, bringing more utility to ADA holders.\nThese developments and others have paved the way for Cardano to become a decentralized and open blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps) such as DeFi to be built upon by developers.\nAs an official light wallet of Cardano built by EMURGO, Yoroi Wallet has evolved alongside Cardano s roadmap by providing updates and new features for users, including staking ADA for passive rewards.\nIn this beginner s guide for new users, we will discuss the basics of setting up a Yoroi Wallet, and how to send & receive ADA.\nThe first thing to understand is that Yoroi is a crypto light wallet with:\nAs a crypto light wallet, Yoroi is able to access the Cardano blockchain without having to download the complete Cardano blockchain, as others do, making Yoroi Wallet faster in conducting transactions over Cardano s blockchain, and faster in interacting with its dApps.\nYet, Yoroi is secure and the user keeps entire control over their assets in their wallet as long as they store their Yoroi private/recovery key properly.\nIn 2022, Yoroi will become increasingly important as crypto light wallets are the most common way to interface with blockchains and their dApps (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) such as the ones being built on Cardano.\nFor demonstrative purposes in this beginner s guide, we are using the desktop browser extension version.\nThe Send tab is the menu used to transfer ADA out of your Yoroi wallet.\nIt s a very simple process and we will walk through it:\nFirst, Cardano is a multi-asset ledger that can record many types of assets like tokens and NFTs.\nThe first field in this menu, the Select Asset input lists all the different crypto assets deposited in your Yoroi wallet.\nFor this example, we ll just use ADA.\nSecond, the Receiver input is the wallet address of the receiving party (recipient) in this transaction.\nThird, the Amount box is how much ADA (for this example) is going to be transferred.\nOn the right-hand side above the Amount box, you can see the transaction fee, which will be calculated automatically by Yoroi. Fees go on top of the inserted amount.\nFourth, Amount Options is preselected by default as Custom Amount which allows you to enter a custom amount.\nOnce filled, the menu should look something like this:\nFor this example, we can see the transaction is for 10 ADA, a custom amount, and the fee is 0.176137 ADA.\nAnother option that is available is that you can select Send all ADA + all tokens under Amount Options which will transfer all the assets currently held in that crypto wallet to the receiver in a single transaction.\n**Please note that selecting Send all ADA + all tokens means you will send your entire ADA balance and your wallet will be emptied after the transaction.\n**This option should only be used if you re planning to move your entire balance of crypto assets to another wallet.\nMost transactions are done using the Custom Amount option instead.\nAll modern Cardano wallets use the prefix addr1, but this was different in older Cardano eras.\nIn the previous era, Byron, wallet addresses began with the prefix DdzFF .\nMost centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.) still use this type of wallet address in their internal services.\nTransfers to these old wallet formats are fine, as Yoroi is compatible with them.\nWe can see in the screenshot above, that a green checkmark is showing for the receiver s address, which means Yoroi recognizes this address as a valid one.\nIf an address not supported by Yoroi were input in this field, the box would highlight in red as shown below, and inform the user this address is not valid:\nIt is also important to note that you double-check the wallet address you are sending to make sure it is the proper address.\nAfter the Shelley Hard Fork, all Cardano crypto addresses now have the prefix addr1 .\nThis is precisely done so users can quickly identify when a wallet address is from the Cardano network.\nSo, for example:\naddr1q9ffft988edkxjang2lpk66lkqa7guwv4m48v4f7krw30ckaflulfe0f6fz35kejmk0rkhuxkse58rmx9wpr6zw660ksyh0uxs\nWe can see that the addr1 prefix precedes the rest of the wallet address.\nLet s look at another wallet address example:\naddr1qy4fhmqjccddf8yxcc6grsw6f9z9s2t9dtxrpfwljttfx7waflulfe0f6fz35kejmk0rkhuxkse58rmx9wpr6zw660kscq57re\nWe can see the same prefix in the second example above.\nYoroi is able to generate multiple wallet addresses that are controlled by one crypto wallet.\nAll of these addresses are found in the Receive tab on the Yoroi Wallet.\nIn this tab, the first thing you ll see is the latest address generated by Yoroi, plus a QR code that can be shared for quicker transfers associated with the said address.\nBelow are all the addresses linked to your Yoroi wallet, plus what balance they have in them:\nSome will have ADA deposited if they have been used in the past, while others will be empty because they never received any transfers.\nAny of the addresses can be reused and can be shared with people when needed. Wallet addresses are different from private keys. As mentioned above, private keys and recovery phrases should never be shared with anyone. (Yoroi Wallet will never ask you for a private key/recovery phrase for wallet support.)\nAdditionally, any of these addresses can be used to withdraw ADA stored on an exchange.\nIf you are taking out ADA from Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc., any of the addresses under the control of your Yoroi Wallet will be able to work with these services.\nIt is also important to double-check your own receiving wallet address before you use it to make sure it is the proper address and that your funds will be received.\nYoroi Wallet is an open-source, Cardano ada light wallet developed by Cardano founding entity EMURGO for ada holders. Since it is a light wallet, it is quick to load and process crypto transactions.\nWith Yoroi, ada users are able to connect into the Cardano Web3 ecosystem of Cardano dApps including the first USD-backed stablecoin in the Cardano ecosystem $USDA, Cardano DeFi, Cardano NFTs, and more.\nClick above to download your preferred version of Yoroi Wallet for desktop or mobile.\nIf you have any questions, please refer to https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/support\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "Cardano 101 Unspent Transaction Outputs UTXO Blockchain Model Simply Explained?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "November 13, 2019\nTogether Agency\nIn traditional banking systems, our personal bank accounts are kept up-to-date through a centralized system of accounts.\nThis means that when you send or receive money for bills or your salary, the banking system keeps track of this through a centralized ledger of debits and credits.\nThe bank records money that leaves one account, enters another, and records the balance.\nThis is an account-based model.\nCardano the first third-generation blockchain to evolve out of a scientific & peer-reviewed philosophy uses a different type of system for keeping track of peoples funds and transactions known as the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model.\nThis UTXO model was first applied to a blockchain at the dawn of first-generation Bitcoin and has been adopted by many blockchains since its inception.\nCardano uses an upgraded version of this model to keep track of who owns what and transactions that are made from peer-to-peer in a decentralized ecosystem.\nIn this blog, we explain the Cardano blockchain UTXO model is, and its advantageous role in the Cardano ecosystem.\nTo understand the UTXO model, it s helpful to think of a very big apple tree with many branches.\nThere are people all over the tree sitting on different branches, with different amounts of apples on each branch.\nOn this apple tree, there is a branch with ten apples hanging from it.\nYou are sitting on this branch of the tree because you own these ten apples.\nImagine now that you want to give four apples to a friend.\nTo give these four apples, two new branches start to grow at the very end of the branch you were sitting on.\nOne of these branches has six apples, and another branch has four apples.\nYour friend then sits on the new branch with four apples and you sit on the branch with six apples.\nThe two new branches have a total of ten apples on them collectively, which is the same as the original branch you sat on.\nNew branches start to grow from your branches in the same way whenever a transaction is made.\nFrom this example, we can see that the two branches were outputs of the original branch.\nOne of these outputs, the branch with four apples on it, represents an output that now belongs to someone else.\nBecause these have been sent to someone, they are spent outputs.\nThe second branch with six apples is your branch of unspent outputs, which grew from the original branch.\nYou are still able to give away these six apples, as these are the apples that are unspent outputs of your transaction to your friend.\nIn this way, there is a clear chain of ownership that builds like a tree over time.\nThe transactions that are unspent can be used for further transactions, and so on.\nIn this way, Cardano prevents double spending attacks.\nIt is impossible to give away apples (ADA) that you do not own, as you cannot transact with apples on a branch you no longer sit on.\nEach branch is linked to a unique public address which everyone has visibility of through a Cardano blockchain explorer.\nThis public address is linked with your private keys, which allow you to send funds to others.\nWith the integration of the Shelley hard fork, Cardano became fully decentralized.\nCardano ADA holders operating stake pools could now receive ADA as a reward for their work in validating blocks on the network.\nFrom the moment that these stake pool operators receive their ADA, the Cardano blockchain records, stores, and communicates all previous transactions based on the UTXO model to everyone else in the Cardano network.\nThis means that the UTXO-based accounting system keeps track of payments and who owns what in a secure manner.\nWhile understanding the model is non-intuitive at first, it is helpful to think of the metaphor above to get a better grasp of how UTXO works.\nIn this case, the thought of a tree with many branches growing from the previous branch is a helpful thought.\nThrough this UTXO method, it is very easy to keep track of ownership of funds.\nWhile Bitcoin invented UTXO s use in a blockchain setting, Cardano is building and evolving on this model by incorporating smart contracts into UTXO, while also offering scalability, sustainability, and interoperability with other legacy systems and blockchains.\nThis creates powerful, decentralized ways to securely model financial contracts and send money in an open and distributed blockchain like Cardano.\nEMURGO is the official commercial arm and a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain.\nFollow EMURGO on our official channels listed below for the latest updates, news, and announcements.\nAbout EMURGO\nAbout USDA\nAbout Cardano Spot\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO Middle East & Africa\nAbout EMURGO Academy\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "How NFTs Add Value to Businesses EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "July 18, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) have been increasingly linked with traditional, big businesses with interest rising in blockchain and the Web3 space.\nTheir business value lies in the unique power to digitally represent brand assets as a token which opens up the potential for increased consumer engagement, new revenue streams, enhanced intellectual property management, community building, and more.\nYet, there are still some obstacles to mainstream NFT adoption.\nThis blog discusses these further and how solving them can add value for companies.\nThe first obstacle is overcoming the technical barrier of coding and programming blockchain smart contracts. For many businesses today, blockchain technology is still an abstract concept that many are unfamiliar with and unaware of its game-changing potential benefits.\nThus, these businesses lack the technical developers to start developing and implementing Web3 technologies such as NFTs and the business development personnel to leverage them for revenue generation.\nThen, there are other businesses that might be aware of the potential of NFTs and blockchain but are hesitant due to the high costs of hiring smart contract developers. They are not only expensive but vetting their technical skills is complicated especially for HR departments unfamiliar with the blockchain space.\nRelated reading:\nOften these challenges are enough to prevent brands from considering the development and implementation of blockchain and related Web3 products & services. Even among many major current brands, few have dedicated tech departments focused on blockchain-related projects.\nAnother obstacle is maintaining brand integrity. For instance, particular brand guidelines that dictate the usage and styling of a business logo, the name of a product or brand, color palettes, and other intricate details make it more difficult to migrate a particular brand into issuing NFTs that represent their products.\nThe problem is even more complicated if a business needs to develop an in-house NFT platform from scratch. Hiring is one obstacle, and then close coordination between the technical team and business development teams is another challenge in and of itself.\nAll these complications also discourage brands from adopting NFTs as they don t want to compromise their brand identity.\nThe general narratives surrounding blockchain are usually centered around crypto which tends to focus more on high-profile failures and scams.\nCombined with also a lack of awareness, this has dissuaded some brands from making sizeable investments of time and money into NFTs and blockchain technology. Many are also unable to identify and partner with reputable companies in the space for technological support.\nHowever, there is a significant and growing community of worldwide users passionate about and interested in using blockchain-based products and services, in addition to cryptocurrencies.\nThis has led to companies and brands thinking about how to connect with these young consumers and leverage blockchain for new products and services.\nFor each of the challenges mentioned above, NMKR s NFT platform provides a solution.\nFor instance, NMKR Studio is a no-code solution that allows any business the ability to deploy its product on Cardano without dedicated smart contract developers. It enables brands to instantly get into the NFT space without having to hire a huge technical team or invest heavily into building their own platform.\nRead more: How NMKR maximizes brand impact\nCompanies can start to dabble in Web3 by tokenizing their assets via NMKR and start to market-test different ideas.\nNMKR is also able to create NFT platforms customized to the look and identity of a specific brand, thereby maintaining brand integrity.\nFinally, NMKR delivers scalability and sustainability via its usage of the Cardano blockchain for NFTs. Brands can be assured that the underlying technology of their NFTs is held to the highest technical standard due to Cardano s provably secure and green technology.\nHere are some potential business benefits of NFTs.\nThese days, brands are facing an oversaturated landscape where traditional advertising is becoming less effective at reaching younger consumers who are more inclined towards embracing trendy, digital-native concepts. Companies that make the jump towards Web3 have shown success in attracting new customers and also creating media stories about their efforts.\nFor example, Nike-RTFKT NFTs have generated $1.4 billion in trading volume equaling around $170 million in earnings by targeting the sneakerhead and crypto-focused audience.\nAnother recent example is the McLaren F1 team, which launched an NFT collection for the 2024 season. The NFTs have been trading in the secondary market and every single one is minted until the supply is exhausted during each race. The NFTs have allowed F1 and McLaren fans to get closer to their favorite sport. Additionally, those collecting the NFTs have the chance to attend one of the races in person. By doing this, McLaren has grown its brand awareness and created a path for fans to be closer to their team.\nIn an increasingly digital landscape with a young consumer demographic, NFTs can create unique experiences and rewards for customers such as exclusive access to events or special edition digital goods. These consumers are willing to be early adopters of new technological trends and can create network effects for digital products such as NFTs. Over the long run, this could strengthen consumer loyalty and engagement with a certain brand if they can utilize NFTs to promote their brand and products in a savvy way.\nNFTs allow businesses to uniquely and digitally represent their products to sell them to consumers on a global scale.\nAt a few clicks of a button, businesses can tokenize their assets using a platform such as NMKR, and issue NFTs.\nAnyone in the world interested in these products could theoretically be able to purchase them outright or even fractionalized portions.\nThis enables brands to more quickly reach an increased number of potential customers and it also allows customers to transact these NFTs with others on secondary marketplaces.\nNFTs can hold programmable metadata within the token itself. This means that unique characteristics defining an asset that has been tokenized and other important details can be incorporated into the NFT by a business. This can verify the authenticity of a product, display transaction history, source of origin, and other information.\nIt would become more difficult to counterfeit brand products and this holds immense appeal for businesses dealing with unique collectibles or luxury items that are commonly counterfeited.\nOnce tokenized as NFTs, business products or assets can be sold to others via the Internet instantly. By leveraging blockchain technology, NFTs can be transacted on a global scale and increase the potential liquidity of a product.\nNFT holders can also re-sell their NFTs to others on marketplaces if they choose to do so. For some assets that can be fractionalized, it also enables multiple buyers to buy a piece of a product that would otherwise be too expensive for them to buy outright themselves.\nInterested in gaining more insights on the use cases of and other related information about NFTs?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Common NFT Misconceptions EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "November 27, 2024\nEMURGO\nAlthough NFTs have increased in mainstream awareness, they remain a commonly misunderstood asset by name. This is due to the blockchain s relatively niche status as an emerging technology and industry, the abstract nature of its technology, and some fraudulent actors in the space. This has resulted in misperceptions and myths about NFTs and their potentially transformative use cases.\nIn this blog, let s discuss these further and address these misconceptions.\nNFTs are a new type of digital asset leveraging decentralized blockchain technology, holding a lot of promise for various industries with their ability to facilitate business transactions, record uniqueness, and provide greater transparency and accountability on a global scale in the digital age.\nMany still assume that NFTs are a type of blockchain itself or a cryptocurrency. In the first case, people confusing NFTs with a blockchain is easy to dispel. A blockchain is rather a type of decentralized shared network that tracks transactions on a distributed ledger. NFTs are one type of asset that can be issued and recorded in that ledger, making it visible to all nodes (servers) and users within that network.\nIn the second case, NFTs are sometimes misunderstood for cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a native underlying asset of a particular decentralized blockchain. It is commonly used to pay for transactions and smart contract deployments on that network. NFTs are digital token types issued on a blockchain network but a user or buyer/creator cannot typically pay a network fee or deploy contracts with the NFT itself.\nAnother common misconception is that all NFTs have no actual utility. However, the true utility of some NFTs lies in their ability to digitally represent an asset and establish proof of ownership and authenticity for the asset. They can also enable greater liquidity for the asset, provide crowdfunding opportunities, verify membership in an organization, and a lot more.\nNFTs can play significant roles in adding value to many business sectors and industries, including:\nWhile there are too many benefits, here is a deeper look at some of the other business use cases for NFTs.\nRead more: Cardano NFTs FAQs\nWhile there have been scams and fraudulent activities associated with NFTs, it is crucial to understand that many NFTs are not inherently scams or get-rich-quick schemes. As with any emerging technology or market, bad actors seek to exploit the hype and lack of understanding surrounding NFTs.\nHowever, the value of an NFT is ultimately determined by the underlying asset it represents and the market demand for that asset, not simply by the act of minting an NFT. Legitimate NFT projects focus on the actual value and utility they can provide rather than just being a tool for speculative trading.\nAnyone interested in NFTs must conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved, and exercise caution when engaging with NFT projects to avoid falling victim to scams or fraudulent schemes.\nIn an increasingly digital world with commerce and business turning to online-based models, NFTs have a wide range of potential uses that businesses can seek to leverage.\nAnother popular misunderstanding is the contribution that NFTs make to climate change. Years ago, the most used blockchain used proof-of-work to run their networks, an energy-intensive algorithm that can indirectly increase carbon footprint.\nHowever, more networks issuing NFTs are now utilizing consensus algorithms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) such as Cardano which is a much more green technology.\nRelated reading:\nToday s NFT industry barely impacts the environment. The PoS algorithm allows millions of transactions to be processed with the same energy levels as those needed to power a house.\nThe first case for NFTs was media distribution, especially images. The most popular use collections were image formats such as .jpg or .png which were used to create NFTs in which one could own the image.\nAn NFT is a digital token with a unique ID that is recorded on a blockchain network. That property makes it unique, as developers can use it to attach information. Images were the first type of information attached, but other examples are:\nThese are some of the examples of data that can also be attached to an NFT in addition to images. They are a very versatile type of digital asset that can be configured to represent a very wide range of real-world assets on-chain.\nRead more: Here is a deeper look at NFT use cases beyond images\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily create NFTs by providing tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established platform, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets.\nIts various products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support enable businesses and individuals to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even provide traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nWant to learn more about business use cases for NFTs, including real-world asset tokenization?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

This is coupled with the fact that more and more industries have already been adopting or experimenting with decentralized blockchain technology to help reduce costs, improve supply chains, attract new clients, and prove the origin of a specific user product.\nThe heightened interest and awareness of NFTs have laid the foundation for mainstream businesses and creators to start getting involved in asset tokenization in the years to come. More tokenization applications and platforms are now available in the market and more users have come into the blockchain space.\nOne of the sectors leading the way in this effort is the premium spirits segment within the alcoholic beverage industry. It s a type of market segment well-suited for NFTs and asset tokenization, as many high-end spirit brands have exclusively sold their products each year that are meant as collectible items for an exclusive consumer sector.\nIn this blog, we ll review the current state of NFTs and tokenization in the premium spirits sector, showcase how these are solving unique business challenges, and discuss the future of asset tokenization in the premium spirits and alcoholic beverage industry.\nLuxury spirits are a sector of the alcoholic beverages business that aims to create unique, exclusive batches of different spirits. These come in limited numbers per year and are bought by passionate collectors all over the world. Many estimates forecast that this market will reach $123.4 billion by the end of 2027. This makes it one of the fastest-growing sectors in the luxury goods industry.\nThis incredible growth has also attracted many unscrupulous actors looking to profit off of this surge in consumer interest. Today, nearly 30 of the alcohol produced in the luxury market is considered to be fraudulent. As a common practice, the bottles and containers used by the high-end spirits are collected and refilled with a cheaper alternative and then sold for the same price in the secondary market.\nRelated reading:\nThese fake alcohols cost the spirits market and alcoholic beverages industry approximately $3 billion US dollars every year. Not only that, but these fake bottles can be very dangerous with alcohol not suited for human consumption which results in serious potential health problems.\nThe need for product authenticity via an NFT certification issued by a high-end spirit brand makes this a prime real use case for asset tokenization. Through an NFT or digital token, consumers can instantly verify the authenticity of their purchased high-end spirit, receive its tracking information, and also transact instantly on a global scale with like-minded collectors. As a result, high-end spirit brands also gain from the increased trust in their products, reach a new young consumer base on a global level, and enhance the marketability of their brand.\nThis mechanism would be a form of real-world asset tokenization using a decentralized blockchain such as Cardano.\nHypothetically, when a user buys an NFT or token representing a bottle of a high-end spirit they are not buying its mere digital image. Rather, they are purchasing the physical bottle itself. However, the new physical possession isn t directly shipped to the person when the transaction is confirmed. Instead, it s kept in reserve by the distillery. The NFT or token is then used as a certificate of purchase and it confirms that the said bottle has an owner.\nAt this stage, the consumer or buyer has some other options.\nThe ID of each high-end spirit bottle is contained in the technical NFT metadata. This enables collectors to confirm if the bottle has already been opened or consumed via this registry. If a bottle is found among the NFTs burned, this indicates that it was already consumed by a user at some previous point and that the bottle on sale is most likely fake.\nFurthermore, each year of a harvest for a particular alcohol vintage can be represented as a collection of NFTs. As more of these vintages are consumed over time, the rarer the unopened bottles become, and by extension, the NFTs in that collection. The track of inventory automatically updates, increasing the value of the individual tokens in each collection.\nCollectors can see in real-time which of the vintages are depleting faster. The owners of these bottles can also plan when it is optimal to sell a particular NFT with the associated bottle. The system services both parties in the market.\nThe NFT matches the uniqueness of a one-of-a-kind rare spirit with ideally each distillery holding a physical bottle and its NFT representation in a 1-to-1 ratio. This means each bottle is a unique experience that is captured by the token on-chain. Each NFT represents these experiences that won t repeat once the spirit is consumed.\nThe above-mentioned NFT collections sold out despite the hefty price tag for each of the bottles. They are all test beds for a new wave of NFT utility that has already proved its commercial viability and also consumer success.\nAt first, the merging of these two industries might seem far-fledged, but upon closer inspection, they are an ideal match. Both complement each other and can solve problems currently faced by the luxury spirit market. It s still very early in this new frontier, but the path has already been made for more success.\nAre you a fan of NMKR and its Cardano NFT platform?\nWant to stay updated on EMURGO s partnership with NMKR and its drive to raise awareness of asset tokenization on NMKR?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to easily receive updates about the partnership and future initiatives with NMKR to drive Cardano NFT usage for asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Ways NFTs Can Solve Problems in Pro Sports EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "August 1, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) have been showing potential synergy with the world of professional sports for some time. These days, sports is viewed as an industry with a progressive stance towards embracing new technologies for the betterment of athletes and fans. With businesses and users moving towards the usage of digital technologies, this synergy seems like a natural progression.\nPro sports is considered one of the biggest attended and viewed events in the world, consistently attracting a high number of fans in person and viewers on various digital media platforms. Media rights deals for popular pro sports are breaking previous records, demonstrating the increasing demand by fans and companies who want to tap into the business of sports.\nIn the blockchain world, there have already been some major collaborations between the sporting world and blockchain technology companies or projects. Yet, the trend is still early, and many in sports are still discovering the potential benefits blockchain-based technologies such as NFTs can offer to sports teams, athletes, and related businesses.\nThis blog will discuss 5 ways NFTs can help solve some common problems in pro sports.\nThere is a market for sports items and moments that come from iconic players, matches, moments, and more. Oftentimes, these can be destroyed by the passing of time and an increasing number of scammers looking to profit. Essentially, an interested buyer would have to trust that the seller or a licensed third party is selling an authentic sports memorabilia product.\nThis is where a blockchain and NFTs provide a powerful use case for product authenticity. NFTs representing these pieces of memorabilia can be issued using blockchain technology and create permanent and immutable records including ownership history, source of origin, and other essential information.\nThese records can be looked up by anyone and no party can manipulate any records. Furthermore, the NFTs can be traded easily between buyers and sellers on a global scale in real-time through the usage of digital token wallets. These NFTs also can never be destroyed or faked, creating a permanent and trusted market for those interested in sports memorabilia.\nRead more: Explaining the technology behind NFTs\nPro sports are a huge, growing business and a global phenomenon. There are passionate fans and supporters of particular sports, teams, and clubs on every continent. This means these sports brands need to continue to appeal to their global audience to grow their fan base and increase revenue over the long term.\nNFTs can play a major tool in this effort.\nMany pro sports entities and athletes are business brands looking to engage with younger fans, most of whom tend to be more tech-inclined and rather open to using emerging technologies.\nAn NFT can be minted by the entity or athlete and distributed to their fans all over the world with equal participation opportunities. The result is a new way to bring these brands closer to their fans. It can also reduce overhead costs for marketing and other business promotional efforts as NFT minting and distribution can be done efficiently and instantly through the Internet.\nFor the fans, they can receive a limited digital token or NFT that demonstrates their passion for a sports team, league, or athlete, that they can choose to keep or trade.\nThe NFT could also be redeemed for an actual physical item from the NFT issuer. It could also be used to access other fan engagement activities that put fans one step closer to a more enriching experience.\nAnother effect of the business of pro sports becoming global is that sports leagues, teams, and athletes need to create global promotions that can effectively reach their fans in different locations.\nSuch marketing campaigns can enable fans to have a sense of equal opportunity to participate in fan activities and have the same chances to win prizes.\nRelated reading:\nNFTs provide a solution to this need. Fans wouldn t have to worry about physically waiting in line or in a digital queue to participate. Any fan with an Internet connection could engage with their favorite team or athlete on a global scale. Sports teams and athletes could come up with ways for their global fans in different countries to use these NFTs for special prizes and activities.\nTeams and brands selling to their global fan base sometimes have difficulties monetizing the gains. For global payments, there are many financial intermediaries, currency conversions, and other related friction points.\nAn NFT sold via a blockchain can eliminate many of these difficulties. Since there is a direct link between the sale of the NFT and the payment, the resulting funds or cryptocurrencies would go directly to the wallet of the creator of the NFT collection and streamline the process. Initially, most might be inclined to use traditional currencies for payment but as awareness grows, sports entities and athletes could integrate certain cryptocurrencies and tokens as payment options.\nTeams and athletes could come up with limited collections of creative NFTs representing various things and market them to their fans as a form of digital merchandise. As mentioned, these NFTs could also be redeemed for various team or athlete-related promotional activities designed to enhance the fan experience.\nSales of pro sports goods on secondary markets don t usually benefit the original brand. There is no concept of royalties when it comes to auctions or sales via private collections. The teams are the originators of the items but do not necessarily benefit from them.\nAn NFT can have a percentage of royalties that go back to the creator from every resale. Teams that embrace NFTs can have a constant source of revenue that comes from the secondary market thanks to this feature.\nThe brands connected to sports are also able to get the same advantage. This can make a new type of market for sports goods that always benefit the teams during their entire lifespan being sold on secondary markets.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily mint NFTs without having to code by providing simple-to-use tools.\nHaving already partnered with Tiamonds to issue and sell NFTs of physical diamonds and Book.io to tokenize e-books, NMKR has demonstrated successful use cases for NFTs using its platform.\nSporting organizations and athletes can also utilize the platform to mint NFTs to receive some of the benefits listed above.\nRead more: How NMKR drives business growth leveraging NFTs\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to receive weekly updates and blog content on Cardano, NFTs, DeFi, blockchain education courses, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Here Are 5 Intersect NonTechnical Working Groups to Join Cardano EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "November 12, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe world of blockchain and Web3 brings people together from all backgrounds, united by a belief that decentralized technology can provide a platform for accessible products & services that can deliver various essential economic services.\nAt first glance, due to blockchain s relative nascency and abstract technological nature, it may seem that only developers can significantly impact its evolution. However, this is not the case.\nMarketing, graphic design, multiple language support, business outreach, and community-building are some of the non-technical skills essential to fostering a stronger blockchain ecosystem.\nIn the case of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, these non-technical skills and talents are especially in demand as the network transitions to a fully distributed blockchain governed by its global community of users.\nTo support this transition and community governance moving forward, Intersect a member-based organization for Cardano governance- is helping to coordinate community members from all over the world to effectively participate in network governance through organizing workshops, drafting documents, implementing technical features, and other important initiatives.\nWith a growing need for many Cardano governance-related tasks, many non-technical skills are essential to help develop and sustain the community. This is where interested participants and users can lend their expertise and skills by joining Intersect and one of its non-technical Working Groups.\nLet s explore these further below.\nFirst, let s go over the Working Groups. From the Intersect documentation, we have a definition:\nA working group is a temporary operation set up to perform a function as needs arise. Working groups can be on any subject and are less formal than the standing committees. Several Working groups are operating, and over time, a number of new ones may be created.\nAny Intersect member can request to be part of a Working Group by contacting them through the Discord channel. They are the focal point for all those looking to expand Cardano s reach and adoption. These groups are created to discuss a limited set of topics, making them manageable and producing results.\nThe Working Groups are pushing Cardano to a new stage in many ways. Everyone should try to get more involved with Cardano. Here is a list of non-technical Working Groups.\nThe Cardano Marketing Working Group is focused on finding ways to attract new people to Cardano. This could be via communication, promotions, or campaigns primarily aimed at those who have heard of Cardano or have yet to enter the ecosystem.\nIts goal is to expand the pool of Cardano users and grow the network. This is crucial, as dApps require new users to grow and become more successful. It s essential to find ways to communicate Cardano to the uninitiated.\nThe Marketing Working Group is also looking for ways to show how decentralized governance sets Cardano apart from other blockchains. None of its competitors are deploying such a comprehensive governance model, so it s a differentiator that must be communicated and promoted to others in the blockchain ecosystem.\nThe Decentralized Education Interest Group belongs to the Membership and Community Committee sphere. It was formed to educate people about blockchain technology, specifically Cardano, dApps, development, personal security, and other topics.\nBlockchain technology is still very new. Most people interact with blockchain networks primarily through centralized organizations such as exchanges, and only some have jumped to using wallets and decentralized applications.\nA significant barrier to this switch is education. Blockchain education is very formal and focuses mainly on computer science and code writing. There is a need for more friendly and broad training that introduces blockchain to non-technical people.\nThe Decentralized Education group aims to be a place for these discussions, a way to find new methods to teach a mass audience and generate material to educate future users.\nRead more: Explaining Intersect s Committees and Working Groups\nUnder the Civics Committee, there is a new Governance Support Working Group. It aims to monitor and create guidelines around the governance process. It supports:\nThe group will have more tasks and expanded responsibilities as the governance process evolves.\nThis Working Group focuses on designing organizational processes that can quickly help solve community problems. Topics could include ideal wallets for beginners, how to receive ADA, where to find a local meetup group, etc.\nThey would think of common questions and challenges people inside the Cardano community would or already have. This group aims to create information pages or general knowledge FAQs that can help answer the majority of non-technical questions a person could face in Cardano.\nThe DReps Budget Working Group is focused on supporting DReps (Delegated Representatives) and preparing them for their crucial role in the budget approval process. This initiative ensures that DReps are well-informed and equipped to participate effectively in reviewing and approving the budget.\nGiven the key responsibility DReps hold within the Cardano ecosystem, this onboarding and education process is essential to maintaining transparency, trust, and informed decision-making during budget approvals.\nRead more: What are DReps and the other Cardano governance bodies?\nThe first step to joining any Working Group (WG) is to be part of Intersect. Intersect membership is open to all. Once that is completed, a member can join any WG via Intersect s Discord where the different channels for each WG are visible and members can start getting involved.\nJoin Intersect now.\nIntersect is the core of all these different Working Groups. Each WG is also under the control of a Committee that decides the tasks for the individual groups. In some cases, the Committees have elections for those who want to be part of one.\nTo receive more information on Cardano governance and Intersect, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "How NFTs Can Be Used in Gaming EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "August 7, 2024\nEMURGO\nMost people associate financial services as the biggest use case for blockchain technology.\nHowever, gaming is also becoming an increasingly popular use case.\nThe characteristics of gaming align with the properties of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in many ways, creating several interesting use cases.\nThus, games are driving a new wave of blockchain projects and adoption, as more are starting to use NFTs to represent in-game or game-related assets. This convergence between gaming and blockchain is creating new markets and trends.\nThis blog will discuss these details further and why gaming companies and projects are looking at NFTs to deliver unique value to their users.\nAn NFT is a digital token minted (issued) on top of an existing blockchain network such as Cardano.\nThese tokens are created by a company, project, or developer to digitally represent something unique. Reasons for doing so may vary depending on the issuer.\nFor instance, a digital representation of a unique item as a token could enable more people to easily purchase and/or sell the item. It could also enhance the transparency and authenticity of the item by providing accessible information about the item and its history included in the token metadata.\nTo accomplish this, each NFT has a unique ID that separates it from others. The ID accompanies the NFTs through all of its transactions making sure it s always identifiable.\nAll this results in one-of-a-kind digital tokens that can be used to uniquely represent almost anything.\nThe first and most natural fit for NFTs is popular card games with a large, established community such as Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic: The Gathering, HeartStone, etc.\nFor these types of games, there is a deck of cards which each contain specific values that can be used during a match between two players. The cards have different levels of rarity and thus power, making some extremely valuable.\nFor example, the most expensive Magic: The Gathering card was sold for $3 million.\nThis sort of game provides a logical fit with NFTs, as a decentralized blockchain network could provide a transparent, immutable, and real-time record of all card assets.\nHaving traditional card games move into the digital realm of NFTs could enable a wider customer base as it allows players to collect, play, and trade their cards with anyone on a global scale.\nPlayers and collectors would benefit from being able to trust the veracity of the issued NFTs and having quick settlement options for trading.\nSports collectibles are another highly popular segment within the gaming population.\nCards of individual athletes and other historical sports memorabilia tend to command large price tags that fans and investors are willing to pay for.\nFor example, the NBA, McLaren, and FIFA have successfully launched NFT collections that attracted millions of fans to blockchain and crypto. They have used a new business model to create unique digital tokens of moments and athletes within their respective sports and market them to their passionate fan bases.\nFor the fans, it enables them to own something related to their sport and have a sense of empowerment of being closely connected.\nThis remains a relatively untapped market that can be expanded greatly in the future as sporting leagues and athletes become more aware of the potential business opportunities of leveraging NFTs to connect with their digitally-savvy young fans. This can include loyalty points, special badges, proof-of-attendance, and other digital marketing campaigns aimed at increasing fan engagement and retention.\nThe strategy genre is another prime target for NFT integration. There are many ways to do so in the form of tradable units, resources, or special characters that go in-game. There is a strong effort to bring new technologies to this genre as it has lagged behind its competitors.\nAn example of this is League of Kingdoms, which has implemented many of the hallmarks of the genre as NFTs for its player base.\nRPG or role-playing games have been around for quite a long time and have proven market demand for gaming-based items. Games like WoW even have extensive black markets for their in-game items due to their popularity with gamers.\nThe same vibrant markets can be recreated in the Web3 space with more accessibility on a global scale with authenticity and transparency features built-in. It offers an attractive opportunity for game developers looking to finally integrate open marketplaces and role-playing games.\nCornucopias is one such example using the Cardano blockchain, an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that aims to bring powerful gameplay and open markets to the industry.\nThis is a genre of gaming where players battle with each other and in most cases, need to craft items and weapons. These assets are used to better the chances of prevailing in the game and advancing in the rankings.\nBattle games are very competitive and have been gaining ground, especially in the mobile industry. They are also another prime example of potential NFT integration, where the crafting materials used and completed items can be represented as NFTs.\nCrypto Blades is an example of this type of game and has attracted a large player base that is also multi-chain.\nThe fact that all this game activity happens on a blockchain involving digital tokens that can be transacted means there is a potential monetary value. For this reason, there has been a relatively new mode of game design resulting from the merger between blockchain and gaming called play-to-earn.\nIn this model, game designers assume players will be able to make an amount of money from playing the game by earning digital tokens in return. They can use this as an incentive to focus on certain aspects of the game or encourage player interaction via active trading. By earning more tokens, these can then be transacted on secondary marketplaces and exchanges.\nIt s a sector that has grown in popularity and has increasingly grabbed the attention of the mobile games industry.\nThe common thread in the examples above is the need to mint or issue NFTs.\nFor businesses and developers looking to use the Cardano blockchain, NMKR provides a user-friendly platform that makes it simple with their no-code required tools.\nNMKR s NFT and tokenization platforms have already been used to successfully mint NFTs of physical diamonds, e-books, and games.\nRelated reading:\nTheir integrated tools to mint NFTs and brand custom pages have attracted many in the Cardano ecosystem.\nSome examples of gaming projects that have used some of NMKR s tools to mint NFT:\nHere are the steps to use NMKR s platform to mint an NFT:\nFollow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn to receive weekly updates and blockchain-related content including Cardano, blockchain education courses, DeFi, DAOs, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "How NFTs Can Boost the Esports Industry EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "December 12, 2024\nEMURGO\nWhile the history of esports dates back decades according to some studies, it started to become popular with the mainstream audience only a decade or so ago due to the proliferation of broadband access, game development, and streaming services which offered easy access for gamers and fans to play and watch.\nThe esports sector has grown considerably and keeps expanding as the world becomes more digital. For instance, the 2024 League of Legends World Championship, a multiplayer game tournament, was watched by nearly 7 million viewers from all over the world, making it one of the most-watched events.\nToday, over 40,000 professional esports teams compete across many categories, demonstrating their immense popularity. As these esports events keep gaining popularity, the number is poised to keep growing and attracting more attention.\nSurprisingly, despite its success, esports are having a difficult time attracting consistent revenue. Various teams are struggling to monetize their popularity as their followers are spread across many countries.\nIn this blog, let s explore more how NFTs and blockchain technology could offer a business solution for esports teams.\nMany esports teams have difficulty monetizing their fame. The sport is global, meaning that fans are located in many different countries.\nFor more traditional sports, teams can resort to conventional marketing and business strategies such as selling tickets and merchandise, etc., as the majority of their fan base is located within a certain geographical region. However, this does not work as easily for esports.\nAs esports is a lot more global with many teams still not having established supply chain partners, each team would have to deal with dozens of different jurisdictions and ship products to almost every continent, increasing costs significantly. It s also harder to gain revenue from selling tickets to individual gaming matches.\nThe legal regulations and logistics make it too complex to do in practice.\nThis is where NFTs offer a solution to these various problems.\nNFTs offer a new way to create fully digital fan collectibles from different sporting brands. They eliminate the need to deal with the logistics and costs of shipping physical goods. They can also be used to organize giveaways, where the prize is given to an NFT holder. Finally, they can provide long-term revenue by sending a percentage of the resell value to the original creator.\nAlso, NFTs are already integrated into a real-time, secure payment system a blockchain network so there is no need to deal with other payment processors. Fans would just need to set up their digital token wallet and cryptocurrencies to buy the NFT collectible from an esports team.\nRelated reading:\nFans always build affinity with particular athletes. Even in team sports, people have their favorite personalities. In traditional sports, these teams or individuals can sell merchandise directly to these fans, as sports teams are generally local. In esports, this is not necessarily the case as some regions don t have any local teams. Reaching a more global audience is difficult without the proper financial and administrative resources.\nHowever, NFTs are digital and can be distributed globally in an instant. They can promote a specific team or esports player. By using NFTs, these teams and athletes can directly reach their supporters wherever they are located and build their profile, helping to promote their brands.\nTeams and players can also create marketing campaigns to drive awareness and demand for paid products and services by distributing NFTs to their fan base. These NFTs can then be redeemed for in-demand products and services that fans can receive a discount on or be stored as a collectible. This could cost less than a traditional marketing ad campaign.\nFans also can use a blockchain network to track their support. They can verify their purchases have gone directly to the team or player they wanted to support, and not to some third party. This greater level of transparency helps the industry and its stakeholders.\nAnother challenge teams have is growing their fan base. With esports teams being global, they have to build interest in the international arena. This is difficult for newer teams that don t have the track record more established ones have.\nThus, some teams have experimented with doing free NFT drops to market themselves. This allows them to reach new audiences and provide them with a digital asset that can generate interest in the team. These sorts of promotions are also more affordable and easier to deploy than traditional marketing campaigns.\nNFTs can also help to bolster identification with the team by providing proof a person is a member of the team s community. They can enable other promotions, like sending free or discounted merchandise, travel tickets to matches, or even chances to meet certain esports players to NFT holders.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service built on the Cardano blockchain. They have also been looking further into the expanding esports market to create a new NFT platform that solves the lack of transparency and coordination in managing player transfers and contracts in today s existing esports infrastructure.\nTo do this, their idea is to partner and develop a decentralized transfer marketplace leveraging blockchain for esports players, focusing on efficient and transparent player transfers in partnership with BIG an established, professional esports team and organization.\nThe decentralized esports marketplace would include:\nPlayer Profiles:\nTeam Profiles:\nSearch and Offer Platform:\nInterested in receiving more information on business use cases for NFTs, such as real-world asset tokenization and gaming?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "How to Create a Cardano NFT Using NMKR Part 1 EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "November 7, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe Mary Hard Fork in Cardano introduced the concept of Cardano native tokens to the network. This enabled users to start minting Cardano NFTs through the Cardano CLI (command line interface). Yet, this posed a technical barrier as it required specialized knowledge. There wasn t a simple, non-technical process for users to easily create NFTs.\nDespite these early challenges, several Web3 developers and artists in the Cardano community were able to create unique, on-chain assets, helping to broaden awareness and build a niche following in the Cardano NFT ecosystem. This enthusiasm quickly turned NFTs into one of Cardano s standout features, helping drive both user adoption and network growth.\nTo address this issue and simplify the NFT minting process, NMKR an NFT and tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain started to gain traction by providing a user-friendly interface and no-coding required solution. Today, NMKR Studio continues to be a popular choice for seamless NFT minting on Cardano, enabling businesses and creators to leverage NFTs to tokenize various types of assets.\nIn this guide, we ll walk you through how to use NMKR Studio to mint your own Cardano NFT.\nThe first step is to create an account on NMKR Studio, which allows anyone to mint NFTs on Cardano.\nOnce there, in the NFT menu, the first thing a user sees is:\nHere, a user can click on Create New Project.\nIn the following screen, several fields must be completed.\nWe ll go over each one, but first, a blockchain network must be selected to utilize for the issuance of NFTs.\nOnce Cardano is selected, a user can upload an image to the platform which will be used to be made into an NFT.\nNote that the images have to be .jpg or .png format.\nIn this guide, only a single NFT will be minted, so therefore several images in a row will not be uploaded. However, NMKR does offer this feature to upload images to be used for NFTs in batches.\nThe Project Name is how the NFT will be identified in the NMKR platform. It can be anything a user desires. In our case, we ll name it Example.\nThe next fields are all optional but important when launching a commercial project.\nThe Project URL is the website of the collection; the Description pertains to the NFT, a TokenName Prefix is a name that goes before the number of a collection, and finally, the X (Twitter) handle of the project.\nAll of these fields are added to the token s metadata. On Cardano, this information is recorded on-chain and transparent for everyone to view.\nNext, a user has the choice of storage provider.\nNMKR supports two options. By default, it uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). But if we expand the menu, we ll see that it also offers Iagon, a decentralized storage project on Cardano.\nNow, the user can proceed to the final two choices on this screen.\nThe NFT reservation time is how long an account can have the asset in reserve before a purchase. Second is the wallet, which will be used to mint the NFTs.\nThis is the wallet address of the project s creator. It ll be used to create a Policy ID for the NFT that will be on-chain. That ID gives control of the asset to the wallet owner used to create it.\nThe next screen is all about the Policy ID.\nA new Policy ID creates a unique identifier tied to the provided wallet address, establishing a fresh collection for new NFTs. If a user selects an existing Policy ID, the new NFT will be added to an already-established collection.\nNext, the Policyscript lock allows you to set a future date as a minting deadline. After this date, no additional NFTs can be created under this Policy ID, effectively locking the supply permanently and ensuring scarcity for your collection.\nFinally, a user can configure the NFT metadata. This information is embedded in the token and visible on Cardano, allowing compatible wallets in the ecosystem to read and display it within the NFT section when users view their NFTs.\nHere, a user can choose between two metadata standards: CIP-25 and CIP-68.\nCIP-25 is the original standard for Cardano NFTs, providing a fixed, immutable metadata format. CIP-68, on the other hand, is a newer standard that allows metadata to be mutable, meaning it can be updated over time.\nFor this guide, we ll use the standard CIP-25 format. It s easier to set up and also cheaper when it goes through a transaction. It s the standard used by most NFT collections on Cardano, so for most use cases it ll suffice.\nIn the second part, we ll go over how to set up the price per NFT, create a discount, and configure the sale conditions using NMKR Studio. All the information anyone needs to know to launch an NFT collection on Cardano without smart contracts.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily create NFTs by providing tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established platform, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets.\nIts various products including NMKR Studio and NMKR Pay with multi-language support enable businesses and individuals to enter the Web3 space seamlessly and even provide traditional fiat payment options to mint NFTs.\nInterested in discovering more business use cases for NFTs, such as real-world asset tokenization?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "DAOs Decentralized Autonomous Organization in 2024 EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "February 13, 2024\nEMURGO\nDAOs or decentralized autonomous organizations are one of the unique entities that were able to be created thanks to decentralized blockchain technology. DAOs are virtual organizations that make decisions, manage resources, start products, and launch projects without a central authority. Essentially, they are an organization or company that runs itself with its own set of rules via its members.\nThe DAO model has been used many times to great success across many different blockchain ecosystems and types of organizations. The result is a new ecosystem of organizations that are global and accept members from virtually anywhere in the world.\nNow, DAOs are at the forefront of technological innovation and open many exciting possibilities for how organizations might be increasingly run soon.\nIn this blog, we discuss some of these possibilities taking shape for DAOs and their implications.\nOne of the first use cases for DAOs was as an investment vehicle. A group of people would organize a particular type of DAO structure and use their preferred voting rights to choose portfolios of assets. Each member would contribute to a shared treasury and profit proportionally to the contributions they made towards buying the assets.\nIn some cases, these DAOs became very successful when allocating to NFTs, tokens, and other crypto assets. Now, there is a new logical extension from the initial DAO investment vehicle, which looks at asset tokenization.\nReal-world assets hold a lot of promise for decentralized or distributed blockchain technology. In this sector, there are groups of DAOs that select a type of good, commodity, or other asset and tokenize them to be traded on a given blockchain. These are some of the main forces driving asset tokenization in many networks.\nAsset tokenization enables businesses, organizations, and investors to tokenize or represent physical assets such as real estate, and non-physical assets such as stocks and bonds, as digital tokens issued on a blockchain. This enables much more liquidity for the asset, fractionalized trading of the asset, opens access to a wider range of global investors, facilitates transactions, enhances transparency of the asset and transactions, and provides faster settlement, among other benefits.\nRead more: What is asset tokenization?\nThere are DAOs for tokenizing real estate, gold, silver, intellectual property, vintage wine, and many more real-world assets. In 2024, these efforts will expand and bring blockchain technology to a new market as tokenization starts to gain more traction in blockchain and business circles.\nIn 2023, governments have started to create frameworks and regulate tokenization and financial institutions have expressed supportive views about tokenization as a new vehicle for business growth.\nIdentity has been one of the most anticipated technologies in blockchain for a while. As a decentralized blockchain enables instant verification on a peer-to-peer level, the idea of being able to have an identity outside the control of central parties and fully owned and controlled by the person is revolutionary. In this respect, there are many efforts to deliver on this promise.\nDAOs are taking a step in this field as well. There are many DAOs creating identity management tools, pseudo-anonymity solutions, wallets to hold identities and tokens, and also privacy protection wallets. All these tools are built around decentralized identity which can be very important in 2024.\nThese days, user privacy is valued more than ever before due to the increasing amount of security breaches and data hacks of centralized organizations. More people are understanding the importance of how identity is managed and recorded on the internet.\nAccording to DataProt, 43 of people globally feel that they lack control over their personal information with many users increasingly distrustful of centralized entities having access to their data.\nHere DAOs have an advantage, as they are managing people s information by their very nature. As the technology of decentralized identity improves, the DAOs creating products around it will increasingly stand out in the market.\nThe rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), neural networks, vectorial databases, and a whole host of other technologies related to Artificial Intelligence have revived the need for decentralized computing. Today, AI is mostly run by centralized data centers that have bought powerful GPUs to process parallel computations.\nThese data centers are controlled by a handful of people in the world and are quickly becoming a monopoly. These not only restrict who can use AI tools, but they also control the information used to train the various models behind AI technology.\nMany DAOs have been created to manage decentralized computing networks. In them, regular users delegate some of the computing power of their local machine in exchange for tokens that reward them for their computational power.\nThese networks can leverage the power of the crowd to open GPU, storage, and computational power to AI developers who don t want to be controlled by the centralized players in the world of cloud computing. These DAOs are a massive promise for the future of AI and computational technology itself.\nAnother major development in the future of DAOs is their relationship with national governments. Much of the unlocked potential of DAOs is due to their uncertain legal status in most countries. Yet, this is set to start to change in 2024, in some jurisdictions.\nThe European Union is preparing to launch a comprehensive overhaul for crypto assets called Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The law does not have any direct provisions for DAOs, but when a DAO issues crypto tokens sold in the EU, they will have to comply with the financial regulations contained in MiCA.\nIn the United States, things are even less clear. Some states have legalized the DAO, such as Wyoming, but the legal status is not recognized at the federal level. The DAOs registered in that state are in limbo and may have to wait until a legal case challenges the Wyoming law that gives them protections.\nRead more: DeFi and global regulations\nA more positive country when it comes to the subject is Japan. In 2023, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) released a Web3 white paper that signals a more open disposition by the country s ruling party towards crypto, including frameworks to recognize DAOs as legal entities in Japan. Things are still under consideration, but given the desire to make Japan a leader in Web3, there is gaining support for clarity and approval.\nLooking for a simple way to receive Cardano ecosystem news and announcements?\nFollow EMURGO on X for everything you need to know about Cardano including informative blogs, events, blockchain courses, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Decentralization in Cardano?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "June 8, 2023\nEMURGO\nKeep in mind that these topics only provide educational information and are in no way financial advice.\nDecentralization is a core ethos of the global blockchain community which plays a big part in the overall Web3 movement. Yet, it s often misunderstood and can sometimes be confusing, especially to blockchain and crypto beginners in the community.\nAs the Web3 movement gains more adoption by individuals and organizations, the focus will increasingly be placed on the level of decentralization of any given blockchain protocol. This creates design, regulatory, and adoption ramifications.\nLet s explore decentralization in blockchain further, especially Cardano decentralization, and how this affects the future of Cardano.\nDecentralization is the distribution of functions, decision-making, and information away from a centralizing single entity (be it an individual, organization, group, or consortium) and into a network of participants.\nThere are both technical aspects and governance considerations when it comes to decentralization.\nIn the technology world, decentralization is more of a spectrum than a binary property. For example, services like Twitter, Netflix, Facebook, etc. have some characteristics of a decentralized system. Each of these apps has nodes (data servers) that relay information to each other, and they have to go through a consensus round to display tweets on a user s feed, for example.\nHowever, the key difference is that in the systems above, there are central nodes that can force certain decisions and overrule other nodes. In those cases, that type of network architecture is known as distributed. Decentralization, on the other hand, can be thought of as a step further beyond distributed.\nIn a decentralized system, the nodes are not able to force any decisions on the other nodes. Every new decision or action taken by the network has to be the result of a consensus round. For this reason, decentralized networks are censorship-resistant and also permissionless in that anyone can join the network and run a node.\nThe most popular blockchains aim to be open-source and decentralized. Depending on the blockchain network, they can utilize different types of consensus. For example:\nCompared to a centralized network, decentralization offers many advantages:\nThere are many ways to consider decentralization and measure it although this is an evolving concept at the moment due to blockchain s emerging tech status.\nUntil then, we ll have to use some metrics to approximate decentralization. One of the most common is the number of validator nodes.\nIn Cardano as of the moment, there are more than 3,150 stake pools that are running for users to delegate their stake and help secure the network in a decentralized manner. These validators are found all around the planet, making the Cardano network a very decentralized and permissionless network for everyone.\nFurthermore, as an open-source decentralized blockchain, many developers are building decentralized applications projects on the network that allows anyone to use their project s services, with more than 120 projects already launched and more than 1,240 projects currently building [1].\nMost of the industry is focused on what decentralization means in terms of technology such as the number of nodes, the safety guarantees of the consensus protocol, etc. Very few have considered other aspects.\nAt the start, we stated that decision-making was part of decentralization. But this aspect has less to do with technology and more to do with the governance structure of the network or blockchain by its stakeholders.\nAs of now and in the future, the Cardano network is focusing on governance by the worldwide community of Cardano developers, stake pool operators, academics, and other users. The objective is to put Cardano squarely into the hands of the community to run with a Constitution, governing bodies, voting rules, and other details after rounds of discussion and debate with the community.\nIn Cardano, this focus on community governance is the main pillar of its Voltaire era. As part of this era, there is a proposal called CIP-1694 which seeks to confirm many of the details mentioned above about how the Cardano network will be governed moving forward and to have it be a sustainable network.\nCIP-1694 which is the on-chain governance component of Cardano is supported by Intersect, a Cardano member-based organization that will serve as Cardano s off-chain governance component to steward the Cardano ecosystem forward with decentralized governance by its members. The Cardano Constitution will also be another pillar that will serve as the guiding document to lay out the decentralized framework and policies of the Cardano ecosystem.\nIn the long run, this will brand Cardano as not only a decentralized blockchain network from a technological perspective but also a community governance one, and become a main technological platform of the Web3 movement.\nRead more: All you need to know about Cardano s Voltaire era\nTo stay on top of the latest announcements and news related to Cardano, follow EMURGO on Twitter and the official channels listed below.\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "Here Are 5 Useful Tools for Cardano Developers EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "November 23, 2023\nEMURGO\nThe Cardano blockchain network is rapidly developing and expanding each year with more developer tools being made available. Numerous dApp projects have launched on Cardano providing DeFi and NFT services and more on the way. This means more and more blockchain developers are jumping into the Cardano ecosystem.\nOf course, this inflow of new developers needs to be matched by new development tools. These tools have to make the experience friendlier, faster, and agile so that the network can expand with new services.\nCardano has met this challenge and there are many developer tools ready for use. Virtually all of them were developed primarily for Cardano, so they simplify many tasks for developers creating dApps.\nHere are 5 useful tools in no particular order for Cardano developers to access and utilize for their dApps.\nThe first platform we ll discuss is Atlas. It s a tool for deploying off-chain code using Haskell. It helps with building transactions, balancing UTxOs, and interfacing with Plutus smart contracts. It was initially created as a private tool for a popular dApp on Cardano, Genius Yield, but the team decided to open it for all Cardano developers.\nAdditionally, they improved it with the help of other Cardano developers such as MLabs, Well-Typed, and Plank. All this makes Atlas one of the most complete solutions for the off-chain code required by Cardano dApps.\nAnother advantage provided by Atlas is that it allows developers to test the logic of the code. The platform can run unit tests that provide ways to asses:\nFinally, Atlas has a more complex set of integration tests. Unit tests work on a local environment where transaction conditions are simulated but don t model the behavior of a dApp in a live network.\nAtlas provides a repository that can be used to spin a private network modeled after Cardano. There the transactions and interactions by the code are more real as they simulate a network that is producing blocks and has other transactions running in it.\nThis gives developers more opportunities to test a dApp before using one of the Cardano test networks. That way most major bugs can be caught before anything is launched on a public forum.\nMaestro is a blockchain data provider for Cardano dApps. It s able to gather information about the current state of the blockchain and input that into a dApp live on Cardano. The platform also provides information for consumers.\nThe dashboard created by Maestro provides an overview of each Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) running on Cardano. This data helps the community make a choice about which projects are best to delegate their ADA.\nFor Cardano developers, Maestro facilitates the launch of an ISPO with minimal time and effort. The ISPO has become a common tool for projects to bootstrap their expenses, gain users, and improve their reputations.\nNow, when it comes to developing dApps, Maestro offers three unique features:\nAll of these tools allow us to reduce the development time of a Cardano dApp. It also makes the job of developers easier by giving them quick access to the state of the Cardano network at any given time.\nRead more: EMURGO Ventures invests in Maestro\nDemeter is a developer tool to set up a Cardano developer environment quickly and run on the cloud. It provides the extensions necessary to interact with the ledger without any further configuration, plus a list of starter code examples for education purposes.\nThe entire environment runs on the cloud which allows developer teams that work remotely to quickly share code. It gives fast access to the Cardano Node running on the same cloud cluster. For both the main network and the test networks, projects can query on-chain data and also submit data to the ledger.\nThe project is the perfect solution for development teams that require to set up environments quickly. It s also the perfect educational tool for students not knowledgeable enough to set up an environment or lack the computational resources to launch one locally.\nOrcfax, is an oracle tool designed for the Cardano network. Data that is outside the ledger is very difficult to introduce into a live network in a way that is reliable and difficult to game.\nThe Orcfax platform has several features that help with this problem, such as:\nAll these attributes make Orcfax one of the best information providers for Cardano dApps. It is a project that aims to change how data from the outside world enters the blockchain with an exclusive Cardano approach.\nThis is our list of some of the developer tools available to the Cardano ecosystem. It s by no means an exhaustive look, as there are several right now live on the network. Each has its strengths and can be a game changer for developers looking to build on Cardano.\nAs the ecosystem evolves, we ll keep a close watch and try to showcase more of these great tools. The community has truly shown its power by creating a whole host of developer tools that put Cardano ahead of the industry when it comes to the developer tool ecosystem.\nAgora is a governance module for Cardano dApps. Many projects want to use the DAO model to make decisions and manage resources. DAOs are also great ways to grow a community and attract users to a project s token. All these reasons make governance an attractive proposition for developers.\nYet, developing voting systems, proposal management, token balance tracking, and many other things needed for a functioning DAO can be time-consuming and outside the expertise of many developers.\nThis is where Agora comes in, it s a complete set of smart contracts and add-ons that can provide governance solutions to any project. This means Cardano developers don t have to invent all the tools from scratch, they just need to deploy the tools built by Agora.\nAre you new to Cardano and want to learn more about building dApps on Cardano?\nLooking for professional instruction to guide you through a full course on Cardano dApp development?\nThen, visit EMURGO Academy, EMURGO s education unit, to learn more about blockchain education courses and to enroll now.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "November 17, 2023\nEMURGO\nCardano Summit 2023, the annual flagship conference for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, has wrapped up along with a sleuth of exciting announcements that could have a significant impact.\nIt was also a time for the global Cardano community to meet in a single location and celebrate the year s highlights and things to look forward to in 2024.\nAs a founding entity supporting the commercial adoption of Cardano, EMURGO hosted a booth and brought many talented Cardano builders to speak at the booth.\nIn this recap, we will recap the highlights and some of the EMURGO booth speakers at Cardano Summit 2023.\nNikhil Joshi COO of EMURGO remarked on the mission of the organization, to quote from him:\nTo facilitate commercial adoption through partnerships with existing ecosystem members and the seamless integration of new entrants. By prioritizing investments, delivering continuous education, and building infrastructure, we aim to unlock the full potential of the Cardano ecosystem.\nEMURGO wants to work with current Cardano projects and help them hit their targets. Also, move projects from Web 2.0 to the blockchain industry, focused on the Cardano network. EMURGO Academy was also highlighted, it has certified 2500 learners in blockchain technology and will continue to expand its offering.\nThe presentation closed with some important announcements. EMURGO will launch an auditing service to review and help secure smart contracts. The future of Yoroi Wallet was also shown, with the next stage becoming a headless crypto wallet.\nThe Cardano Summit was packed with important announcements. The ecosystem has grown rapidly since the last summit and it s accelerating as we speak. EMURGO has played a major role in this expansion, and it will expand its offering in the future. The next summit will be even bigger for the Cardano community.\nWatch Nikhil s presentation below.\nEMURGO announced a strategic partnership with NMKR during the summit. The objective is to increase the tokenization of real-world assets on the Cardano network in the form of NFTs. Additionally, both entities want to amplify brand increase marketing efforts, and lead generation through Events, PR, Social and Global Media Partnerships and also strategic access and localization of NMKR to Asian markets, new business development, and integrated partnerships for the platform s user expansion.\nWatch the Cardano Summit 2023 recap video below.\nAt the main stage, during the first day of the Cardano Summit, Yosuke Yoshida, Co-CEO of EMURGO Middle East and Africa gave the community an update regarding all the initiatives underway in Africa and the growing Web3 landscape on the continent. Yoshida leads EMURGO s efforts in the Middle East and Africa, making him an important piece in the overall aim of Cardano.\nAfrica represents a major market of expansion as the continent s population is very young, 97 of them below 65 years of age. This is coupled with mobile network coverage which at the moment stands at around 46 and is the preferred way to access the internet in the continent.\nThe Co-CEO of EMURGO then elaborated on the blockchain and Web3 technologies and their use cases for the African continent. One clear example, is stablecoins have started to play a major part in the regions, especially to those lacking access to regular financial services and dealing with high transaction fees in the legacy banking system. Users can go to the stablecoins to protect themselves against local currency depreciation, as well as, use it for remittances.\nTo quote him directly:\nMy interest gradually grew towards the emerging markets. Why? Because I thought and we thought that technology and blockchain, it makes much more sense in the emerging markets than in the developed markets\nOne highlight of the blockchain applications in Africa came from Nigeria. One Nigerian startup developed a system to use blockchain and settle intra-banking transactions, which has been a major source of over costs for users and a major inefficiency in the financial sector. Some banks in the country have adopted such a solution.\nThis integration of blockchain with real-world applications has changed the perception Africans have of the technology. In the West, it is seen as a speculative asset class or a vehicle for scams. In Africa, on the other hand, users in Nigeria see it as the future of money, while in other parts as an alternative to the traditional financial system.\nEMURGO has seized the opportunity and invested in the last 3 years in 40+ companies across Africa, a majority of them ready to build on Cardano and use it as a base for their tokens. Yosuke Yoshida highlighted the variety of offerings in Africa such as Nodo, EMURGO Labs, EMURGO Kepple Ventures, and Adaverse among many others.\nFinally, EMURGO along with PWC has released a report that details more of the developments in Africa. One conclusion is that the continent won t follow the same path as developed nations, instead, they ll adopt the latest advancements and leapfrog over other regions. Blockchain technology is among these key technologies, and Cardano along with EMURGO is best poised to help the African continent with this project.\nWatch Yoshida s full presentation below.\nSebastian Zilliacus from Cardano Spot gave an update on the project. In Web 2.0 there is an environment of censorship, lack of control over data, poor monetization, and even possibly being blocked by certain governments.\nSocial networks that work in the Web 3.0 space can solve all these problems and create a fairer playing field for content creators and content consumers. But it s still in its infancy, blockchain social networks still lack good user experience, clear regulations, network effects, and education on how to use them.\nCardano Spot is moving in these areas. It has already completed 3 phases of development and the 4th one will bring: open access out of its beta state, Cardano Wiki, content ownership, gamification, rewards systems, and enhanced content discovery. The Cardano Spot platform will be the trailblazer of the social networks on Web 3.0.\nWatch Sebastian s full presentation below.\nIn an exciting first, the Cardano Summit hosted the Battle of the Builders. It was a live challenge where ten teams took to the stage to create a solution on Cardano, the teams participating included: NMKR, NEWM, Xerberus, Fida, Mehen Finance, Iagon, ZKFOLD, Maestro, and TVVIN.\nTakashi Hayashida from EMURGO Ventures was one of the judges for the competition. In the end, there were three winners: 1st place Maestro, 2nd place NEWM, and 3rd place ZKFold.

    "instruction": "How Intersect Supports Cardano to be a Leader in Community Governance EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "December 19, 2023\nEMURGO\nGovernance plays an important role when a group of stakeholders such as an organization, corporation, government, etc. Governance deals with the structure and process of enabling the stakeholders to cooperate and function fairly and transparently to achieve the group s mission.\nMany blockchain projects are finding out that creating a sustainable, fair, and distributed governance structure is quite complicated as their communities and developers find themselves at odds with each other as to how to best allocate resources and enable governance to be autonomously run.\nThis has genuine consequences and can be devastating for the sustainability of a blockchain network as happened with the Block Size Wars and other hard forks happening in other blockchain ecosystems. These splits are very damaging to the community and can have lasting consequences.\nSo while it s clear that governance is one of the key components for the success of a decentralized blockchain network, it s still often overlooked by most blockchain developers. It s a difficult discussion and one that can have many repercussions for community and network sustainability.\nIn this blog, we ll review some of the different Web3 or blockchain governance models and discuss how far they are along. We ll limit ourselves to models that govern an entire blockchain and not a discussion about DAOs or other mechanisms to control individual projects. In the end, we ll explain how Cardano s member-based organization Intersect and its innovative features make Cardano the leader in blockchain community governance.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, governance means the act or process of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something (such as a country or an organization) .\nIn a blockchain network, there is the added requirement that governance must also maintain decentralization or fair distribution among its community members. It must also give a voice to its community members. If these conditions are not met, then the rest of the network may fall prey to the interest of centralized actors.\nAdditionally, the core developers of a decentralized blockchain have to manage the complexity of decision-making in an international setting, as blockchains are digital domains with no physical borders. A robust governance structure will reduce uncertainty, conflicts, and costs for the stakeholders of the systems.\nStakeholders are also multi-faceted. Some users interact with the network regularly, but also the developers who created the dApps and tools for the ecosystem leveraging the network s decentralized technology. Finally, there are also infrastructure providers who maintain the network, and the nodes of the network.\nA community governance structure for a permissionless blockchain has to balance all the requirements of decentralization, its various stakeholders, and the risks of centralization. Every community member must have a way to participate in governance. In most cases, it is a monumental task that has many facets to be considered.\nThe blockchain industry has two governance models each with categories of their own. First, we have off-chain governance, and second, on-chain governance.\nOff-chain governance refers to mechanisms that are outside a blockchain. They rely on other forms of agreements that then are used to resolve disputes, assign resources, or direct development.\nSome examples are:\nMember-based organizations/consortiums: a group of voluntary organizations with ties to a blockchain ecosystem joining together to foster transparent and accountable governance through voting and regulatory measures, and other initiatives as needed\nGovernment councils: a group of people form a committee and they are the ones that direct a blockchain via votes.\nCore developers: a group of developers who work at the low levels of a blockchain network and who maintain the code repositories are the ones who choose the direction of a blockchain.\nThere are other variations, but all fall under similar designs. Several people or organizations can make changes and make decisions based on some special criteria. The results of votes and decisions sometimes can be public and other times kept hidden depending on the structure.\nOn the other hand, we have on-chain governance. This method relies on decisions made by having votes taken by stakeholders directly on top of the ledger. The path to make proposals is also open but normally it requires some sort of criteria such as being a node operator or having a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nThe main mechanism for decisions is always voting. The difference is who gets to vote and why are they given this power:\nNode operators: in most networks looking to implement on-chain voting, this is only reserved for the node operators. The logic states that since they are the ones maintaining the ledger, their input is what best aligns with the long-term success of a network.\nStakeholder direct voting: under this mechanism, all the participants in a network are given a say on the future of the blockchain. They are divided between representation sectors and voting mechanisms are developed for each one.\nDelegation: There is also an option to delegate your vote via different designated representatives.\nThe concept behind this model is that allowing a plurality of voices to decide ensures the long-term stability of a blockchain.\nIntersect is an off-chain member-based organization (MBO) supporting the on-chain governance model of Cardano. It s an open institution in which any member or organization of the Cardano community can participate. It s meant to lay the foundations of the future of the network.\nThe main way Intersect will accomplish this task is by the formation of different committees. The committees and working groups will discuss all the aspects related to governance in Cardano and support distributed community governance in tandem with the implementation of CIP-1694 features for users to easily govern Cardano. Both are essential for the success of Intersect.\nIntersect is an open hub for governance discussions. It exists as the vanguard for this topic and it ll be the backbone of the governance model of Cardano. Participation is open and there are no barriers to joining and contributing. In this way, Intersect is leading decentralized governance discussions on Cardano and across the industry.\nRead more: How to get started with Intersect\nThe committees are meant to discuss broad aspects of Cardano governance, how to support CIP-1694 (on-chain governance feature proposals for Cardano), and anything else that deals with governance.\nThey are long-term associations that will continuously improve and discuss the focus area to which they have been assigned such as the Membership Committee, the Community Committee, Open-Source community, etc.\nWith the Intersect organization helping to organize and support governance, the next piece of the puzzle is the actual and technical parts of Cardano s on-chain governance. This part deals with the registration of the SPOs, DReps, and the Constitutional Committee, and the tracking of the votes of the governance proposals. It is the portion that provides the security and audits of the feature proposals outlined and discussed within CIP-1694.\nHere Intersect is also providing tools for those looking to participate in the governance process. The main one at the moment is the SanchoNet Governance Portal. A site where community members can register as DReps, delegate their ADA, and track the votes.\nIt s all done in the SanchoNet test network, so none of the votes are binding, it s meant to be a learning playground for the future of governance. It simulates how the final platform will perform and allows the community a place to test and make changes before full release.\nRead more: What is CIP-1694?\nWant to know more about Cardano governance and Intersect?\nFollow EMURGO on X to stay up-to-date on all things related to Cardano governance including videos, blogs, and announcements.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "November 9, 2023\nEMURGO\nIntersect is the off-chain forum, organizer, and main hub for discussion around the distributed community governance model of the Cardano blockchain which has now transitioned to focus on distributed community governance. Its objective is to gather membership support for a sustainable, community-driven Cardano governance structure.\nAs a member-based organization (MBO), Intersect has more than 630 members and is increasing quickly. It contains various governance layers and committees to support the planning, coordination, and execution of governance matters.\nThus far, Intersect has collected the Cardano community s feedback from the CIP-1694 (the on-chain technical component of Cardano governance) workshops and is planning to create more activities to raise awareness and member participation in Cardano s off-chain governance.\nThe Intersect MBO is open to anyone in Cardano who wants to participate and help shape the future of the network.\nThe first place to retrieve official information is the Intersect website. One can find regularly updated news regarding Cardano s governance model. It s also where those looking to join Intersect can go and fill out the subscription form.\nIntersect is meant to grow a distributed and inclusive self-sustaining blockchain ecosystem by providing the accessible space necessary for structured discussion around governance for the Cardano network.\nAdditionally, Intersect will be an important institution that supports the maintenance, development, testing, fundraising, and governance infrastructure for the Cardano network.\nAll these will be accomplished via a series of working groups or committees that will meet and talk about the various needs of Cardano. The groups will be composed of members of all backgrounds from Cardano. This is why it s crucial to participate in it, as it s a great chance to contribute to the growth and future of the network directly.\nRead more: What is CIP-1694?\nIntersect runs monthly town halls where most of the latest information is presented. It s also a place where people in the community can meet and start interacting with each other. The town halls are also a place where the future of Intersect is discussed.\nAs of the writing, the working groups are still in the process of organization. The membership is not fixed and the requirements to participate in each of the groups need to be set. Also, how many working groups should initially be released is an open question.\nThis makes participating in the Town Hall even more important. Right now it s the place to enter the discussion and learn when the other functions of Intersect will come online. As Intersect is a very recent creation and it is still in the very early stages.\nTown halls are conducted remotely via Discord. The invite for the server of Intersect is sent in an email to those who join via the website. All those looking to participate must join Intersect before they get the link to enter the Discord server.\nIntersect is at its beginning stages, so it needs a lot of tools to onboard people to the community. To broaden that effort, the MBO has launched its first grants for those looking to enhance governance in the age of Voltaire for the Cardano ecosystem.\nThese grants are exclusive for those who join Intersect, but once inside, the application process is very open. The first batch of applications is already ongoing, but none of the selections have been made.\nThe classification of governance tools is divided among categories. There are currently two open applications, with two more planned in the future, these are:\nDRep Campaign Platform (currently open): In the future governance model of Cardano, ADA holders can choose delegate representatives (DReps) to cast votes on their behalf. These holders need a common space to discover and explore registered DReps. A place where a profile with the background of the person is displayed, the voting record, and other information that presents a case for that individual.\nThe current grant program is open to any tool that can create solutions at this level. It s also aiming to create a DRep campaign platform, where these people can promote themselves and make their case to the Cardano community.\nConstitutional Committee Portal (currently open): this committee is one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions under CIP-1694. The Constitutional Committee Portal will be a tool for the institution s members to share their voting records and rationale for each vote cast. It ll serve as a record for future votes and a way to track the impact of individual members.\nEducation: a future category that aims to bring tools around the education of Cardano governance. There are no more details at the moment.\nLocalization: a future category to create tools that localize the Cardano governance information. Most of it is produced in English, which excludes many members of the Cardano ecosystem, this category will aim to create tools around this issue.\nThose are the ways to start interacting with Intersect today. As the MBO grows and becomes more complex, more opportunities will open for the Cardano community. It s important to be aware and participate actively, as this is the best chance to shape the future of Cardano.\nCurious to know more about how community governance will work in Cardano?\nWant to learn more about Intersect and other Cardano community events?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X for a simple way to receive updates and helpful content to get up to speed on all things Cardano.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Why Crypto Projects Built on Cardano Are More Secure EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "November 7, 2023\nEMURGO\nThe Cardano blockchain was designed and built to be secure from the beginning in addition to being scalable, sustainable for generations, and interoperable. The objective was to create a distributed and open-source platform leveraging scientifically proven technology that supports all types of economic activity for everyone wanting access.\nThis emphasis on security also extends to Cardano smart contracts. As we have discussed previously, the blockchain industry is plagued with hacks and exploits. The average blockchain or dApp hack in Q1 2023 amounted to approximately $10.5 million per hack!\nThe trend is slowing down as many blockchain networks focus on their security, but the state is far from ideal. Let s look closer at Cardano smart contracts and why Cardano can be considered to be more secure.\nCardano extended the Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) model prevalent in Bitcoin in a unique way to support the execution of smart contracts. In a nutshell, the Cardano blockchain comprises a list of unspent transactions, which users can only consume.\nThe transaction, in this case, is a change of a group of already existing UTxOs into some new sets of unspent transactions. These UTxOs have rules attached to them that specify what transaction can be spent. It s the Cardano network s job to validate a transaction if it follows the made rules for every single one of the inputs in the transaction.\nThe most simple rule of these is that of the signature. An input can only be spent if it s associated with a signature made by the account with the UTxO. That s how regular transactions work for Bitcoin, but also for Cardano and the few blockchains that continue to use the UTxO model.\nThe E in the Cardano EUTxO stands for extended which is the innovation of the network. Transactions in the Cardano model can be signed by a smart contract address and be spent only by transactions that obey rules coded in the smart contracts.\nThe rules are encoded using the languages that were created to build on-chain code such as PlutusTx, Aiken, Plutarch, and others. The name given to these rules that must be followed to sign a transaction is validators .\nRead more: How to become an on-chain Cardano developer\nThe validator is a function that requires all the inputs to be correct, which are:\nContext: can check anything about the transaction being processed like the inputs, outputs, or minted tokens.\nDatum: some additional data attached to the UTxO for the validator to potentially use. For example the address of the owner, the price of an NFT, or exchanging token A for token B on a DEX.\nRedeemer: is just any data that the spender can attach to the transaction. For example, in a simple transaction, a redeemer is the signature of the wallet which contains the UTxO a user wants to spend.\nThese are the inputs that can go into a validator to process a transaction. They are finite and as a rule, the number of inputs must equal the number of outputs, minus the network fee. The one exception to the rule is when new tokens are minted, so the output grows by the number of new tokens minted on the network.\nThis design is what allows an EUTxO network, such as Cardano, the ability to process custom logic or smart contracts. Among the UTxO protocols, it was the first to have such a design and it proved the UTxO created by Bitcoin can be used for this purpose.\nTwo aspects make Cardano more secure than other networks.\nFirstly, we have the EUTxO model that was developed for the blockchain. It means it s easy to check the logical steps a transaction needs to be successful and verify if there are any vectors of attack.\nThe fact that a validator has a predictable number of inputs and can only produce a set number of outputs is perfect for audits. The auditors only need to follow the logic of the validator to see which of the outputs is desirable and suggest correction if undesirable outputs are present.\nIn this way, smart contracts on the Cardano network can be easily mapped. The results just form inputs to outputs and generate a concise logic to test. This is very different from the model of smart contracts on account-based blockchains where the interactions of smart contracts are uncertain.\nOn Cardano, the EUTxO model makes transactions deterministic, meaning the outcome of a transaction is predictable. In other networks, transactions are usually non-deterministic, meaning the outcome cannot be exactly predicted and there are always uncertain states possible.\nSecondly, Cardano uses native tokens. Other blockchains have decided to use smart contracts for the generation of tokens and other assets. This creates a need for smart contracts to have a hierarchy of permissions where assets need to be spent by other smart contracts.\nThink of a DEX in this model, when you want to swap a token the DEX asks for authorization to spend token A, the one the user is using for the swap with token B. This means the smart contract of the DEX has control of token A. If the smart contract is malicious, it can steal token A from the user.\nAdditionally, these smart contracts must always borrow different levels of permission from one another. This means there is a complex web of authority delegations that can be exploited or where mistakes can be made.\nOn Cardano, the native tokens don t have this issue. The Cardano ledger treats every asset as native to the blockchain. This means a transfer of a token only needs the regular signature of the user s wallet, and the user does not need to surrender any control of the token.\nIn the case of a smart contract, the only thing needed is the logic in the validator. The UTxO used by the user are the only ones the validator can see, as inputs to the transaction, and cannot spend anything else.\nCardano was designed with an emphasis on security from the beginning. The EUTxO model has now been battle-tested. For over two years there have been no major breaks in security and developers can create dApps with confidence.\nOn the other hand, auditors know that smart contracts follow a predictable logic. This makes their job more straightforward and reduces the possibilities of outcomes not foreseen by the steps coded into the rules of the validator.\nAre you new to Cardano and want to understand Cardano?\nHave you been in the Cardano community for a while and want hands-on instruction about building dApps on Cardano?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X (formerly Twitter) for EMURGO Academy course offerings, free webinars, and more!\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Cardano NFT Case Study NMKR and Tiamonds EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "February 8, 2024\nEMURGO\nWeb3 solutions providers such as NMKR are making it easy for businesses to tokenize their real-world assets using their platform and expand their business reach on a global scale. Leveraging Cardano s decentralized and research-driven blockchain technology, NMKR offers an NFT and Tokenization service that aims to bring Web3 to the masses by making it easy for anyone to mint and issue tokens of their assets. This means increased potential for revenue, brand visibility, and new customers.\nThese days, more and more types of assets are being brought into blockchain through tokenization and this expands instantaneous access to markets previously unreachable by many businesses and people.\nIn this blog, we will take a look at one of the first real business partnerships utilizing blockchain for tokenization and the unique client benefits it provides.\nDiamonds are one of the most sought-after physical items in the world, particularly for their uses in luxury jewelry. The precious gemstones are beyond the reach of many due to their pricing, and buying and investing in them can also be difficult due to administrative, handling, shipping, and safekeeping issues.\nThrough a strategic partnership with NMKR, Tiamonds provides a modern solution to these problems by using blockchain technology for the tokenization of diamonds.\nTiamonds is a platform that takes real diamonds and digitally tokenizes them as NFTs. The NFT issued by Tiamonds is a 1 to 1 representation of the ownership rights of real-world diamonds that are kept by the project. In other words, a Tiamonds NFT holder has the property rights to exchange it for a physical diamond whenever he or she wishes to do so.\nRelated reading:\nThe diamonds purchased are verified by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). Each of the diamonds is certified by one of the highest authorities on independent third-party diamond certification. The diamonds are also purchased from legitimate sources not involved in funding conflict and compliance with UN General Assembly Resolution 55/56.\nThe diamonds are held in vaults contracted by the project and insurance is purchased using the Lloyd s of London agency. As each NFT bought on the Tiamonds platform represents ownership of an individual diamond, the user can redeem his/her NFT for the physical gemstone after completing the legal requirements.\nThe platform also allows for the fast trading of tokenized diamonds. Anyone with a Tiamonds NFT can sell it over their system and receive the price for the stone, with the transaction being processed using blockchain technology. The counterparty immediately receives ownership of the diamond once the transaction is complete.\nA Web3 service such as Tiamonds enhances the liquidity of diamonds and provides an interesting use case for tokenization, as people don t have to physically move the stones from one location to another. Transactions and settlements are nearly instantaneous, completed with transparency (transaction information can be viewed in real-time online), and enhanced security. Every diamond has the GIA certification, so there is no risk of counterfeits inside the Tiamonds platform.\nAccording to Tiamonds, it believes that asset tokenization will grow to become a market worth at least USD 10 trillion by 2030, representing a 40-fold increase in the value of tokenized assets from 2022 to 2030. This would mark a significant rise from the current value of around USD 300 billion.\nTiamonds partnered with NMKR to sell 34 of its NFT diamonds on the Cardano blockchain by leveraging NMKR s tokenization platform. They identified Cardano as the next network to expand their tokenized diamonds due to its research-driven and provably secure technology and selected NMKR to prepare the NFTs.\nThe teams used the NMKR Studio tool to set up a store for the 34 Tiamond NFTs, as seen in this link. Within 48 hours, the entire collection of 34 NFTs sold out, marking a major success for the project and its first venture in the Cardano network.\nRead more: What is NMKR Studio?\nThe teams also prepared a giveaway to celebrate Cardano Summit 2023, the annual flagship event for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Tiamonds prepared 10 of its unique NFTs for a giveaway at the Summit. The project distributed 1000 QR codes, and 10 lucky winners received the tokenized diamonds as NFTs.\nThe partnership showcases the versatility and power of NMKR Studio. Tiamonds was able to quickly set up its tokenized diamonds using Cardano NFTs which sold out almost immediately. Second, the team launched a giveaway during the most important Cardano event of 2023 to increase awareness and visibility.\nNMKR and Tiamonds have shown the power of tokenization of assets using blockchain technology. It immediately opens up market access, reduces transactional friction, and speeds up settlement, all with increased security and transparency.\nAre you interested in asset tokenization on Cardano using NMKR?\nWant to keep up-to-date with the latest from EMURGO s partnership with NMKR?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to receive updates about the partnership and future initiatives with NMKR to drive Cardano NFT usage for asset tokenization.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "input": "",
    "output": "November 14, 2022\nEMURGO\nKeep in mind that these topics only provide educational information and are in no way financial advice.\n*Updated November 24. Ardana has stopped working on the project.\nStablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of a fiat currency like the US dollar, is an integral part of any blockchain ecosystem.\nThey are one of the main building blocks allowing new and existing cryptocurrency users to engage in cross-border remittances, digital payments, cryptocurrency trading, NFT transactions, and a lot more.\nAs of today, there are no live stablecoins on the Cardano blockchain network, but native Cardano stablecoins are under development.\nDespite this, there is a robust history of research on Cardano stablecoins that has led to innovative designs to launch the next generation of stable cryptocurrencies on Cardano, especially with smart contracts and Cardano native assets functionality already having been integrated into the Cardano blockchain.\nCombined with the 3.9 million+ active ADA wallet addresses around the world and one of the largest blockchain networks in the industry by market capitalization, Cardano is primed for native stablecoin types to take the next leap in onboarding users to gain accessible financial services.\nIn this blog, we will look at the short history and current status of stablecoin development on Cardano.\nAn algorithmic stablecoin aims to provide price stability and balance its circulating supply by being pegged to a reserve or backing asset non-tangible to the real world.\nAn algorithm is in charge of issuing more stablecoins when its backed asset increases above 1 US dollar and buying them off the market when the price falls below 1 US dollar. The inner workings of this system are coded in a smart contract.\nThe Djed stablecoin is minted by users sending Cardano s native cryptocurrency ADA to a smart contract, then the contract will send an equivalent amount of Djed back to the user. As the price of Djed hovers around $1, the smart contract behind Djed is in charge of balancing the supply in circulation to maintain the price stability of Djed around $1.\nHowever, there have been problems in the past with algorithmic stablecoins backed by a single cryptocurrency.\nTo address these shortcomings, Djed has a reserve asset called the Shen token.\nThe role of the Shen token is to help ensure price stability by guaranteeing the collateralization rate and the price peg of the stablecoin.\nOn Cardano, the Djed stablecoin has been working on a testnet for a few months.\nThe COTI project also received funding from the cFund, IOG s innovation fund.\n*Updated November 24. Ardana has stopped working on the project.\nArdana is another project launching a stablecoin on Cardano.\nThe team received funding from the cFund, IOG s innovation fund.\nArdana is looking to create a stablecoin, the Ardana dollar (dUSD), backed by crypto tokens locked in the protocol used as collateral.\ndUSD is minted by depositing collateral assets into vaults within Ardana s protocol using unique smart contracts known as Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs).\nThe collateral provided is used to create an equivalent amount of dUSD which then enters the market.\nOther users then buy dUSD tokens on exchanges, or simply by receiving them as a means of payment.\nThe dUSD in circulation maintains its stable value by the collateral locked in the vaults.\nIf a vault falls short of the necessary collateral amount, it s liquidated in an auction.\nLiquidators bid against each other to repay the undercollateralized vault s stablecoin debt in exchange for receiving the vault s collateral at a discount.\nA liquidated vault will then be charged a liquidation penalty, which will be taken from the vault s underlying collateral.\nAgeUSD was a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin discussed by the Ergo Foundation, EMURGO, and IOG for the Ergo Blockchain.\nAgeUSD was designed to not use CDPs, as in some of the examples mentioned above. The AgeUSD model has been applied to the Ergo blockchain by the project SigmaUSD.\nIn SigmaUSD, Reserve Providers submit ERGs (the native cryptocurrency of Ergo) to the protocol s reserves, by doing so, they mint ReserveCoins (called SigmaRSV). Each SigmaRSV represents a portion of the underlying ERG reserves held in the dApp s treasury.\nThe SigmaUSD users also submit ERGs as reserves, but when they do so, they mint SigmaUSD instead. This is only allowed by the protocol if there are sufficient reserves within the treasury, meaning each SigmaUSD in circulation has more collateral to support its stable value.\nAt any point in time, a SigmaUSD token can be redeemed in exchange for ERGs from the reserves equal to the current exchange rate as determined by the ERG-USD Oracle Pool. This burns SigmaUSD tokens out of circulation in direct proportion to the ERG coins removed from the reserves.\nIf you know of other projects building stablecoins on Cardano, then please reach out to us at marketing@emurgo.io\nYou can follow EMURGO s official channels listed below for up-to-date information and announcements about EMURGO and Cardano.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nEMURGO Group Pte.

    "instruction": "5 Other NFT Use Cases You Need to Know About EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "March 28, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) are one of the blockchain use cases that have had significant adoption with mainstream brands and users over the past few years. They have captured the imagination of big businesses and users as a way to uniquely represent a transactional brand asset in an increasingly digital world.\nWhile there was an initial fervor, the concept and unique value proposition of NFTs issued on a decentralized blockchain remains and continues to grow in awareness and develop as a sector within blockchain.\nWith more interest in blockchain and crypto, there is also naturally more interest in NFTs as well. Additionally, asset tokenization is an area of emerging discussion within business circles and a potential game-changing use case for NFTs and blockchain technology due to the versatility of NFTs to tokenize nearly any type of asset including tangible and digital assets.\nAs many people associate NFTs with art pieces and video content, here are some other NFT use cases to be aware of.\nRead more: What is asset tokenization?\nWhen it comes to the usage of NFTs for asset tokenization, real estate is a huge use case where NFTs provide many unique benefits over existing methods. Some blockchain-based projects are working on creating platforms that take the real estate and land registry deeds of property and tokenize these assets. These property rights are then able to be traded as digital tokens on other platforms and marketplaces that are under development. Especially in regions where property and land registration rights and processes are underdeveloped, NFTs present a compelling use case due to their transparency and accountability.\nNFTs can record the property s information instantly along with other important details in the metadata. Anyone can access this data at any time since it is issued on a decentralized blockchain.\nRelated reading: EMURGO Africa and Adaverse invest in HouseAfrica to create a digital property registry\nLandano is a project on Cardano that aims to integrate blockchain technology into land registration and property rights. They recently held a panel where the project s team discussed the topic. They already have implemented the solution in Africa and showed great promise.\nNFTs also allow for the fractionalization of the token which increases its accessibility and liquidity. Potential investors can buy portions of properties and this opens up investment opportunities to a much wider range of investors.\nWhen we think of financial services using decentralized blockchains or decentralized finance (DeFi), people usually think of fungible assets. While DeFi applications tend to use fungible tokens in most cases, NFTs are also making inroads into the DeFi space.\nIncreasingly, assets that have some unique characteristics are being represented as NFTs. Some of the prominent potential use cases are government bonds and treasuries. This type of debt is issued by countries to raise funds as each bond has unique features that need to be captured by a blockchain asset such as the coupon payment, the date of the payments, the duration, etc.\nRelated reading: 5 promising real use cases for DeFi\nTokenizing these bonds usually involves the usage of NFTs. These NFTs can then be simply traded on top of the decentralized blockchain ledger directly through the involved parties or on marketplaces. They are very much a big potential part of the DeFi ecosystem even though they are not the traditional token standard for that ecosystem.\nTickets for sports matches, concerts, conventions, and other events have long been an ideal use case for NFTs. Indeed, many major blockchain events like Devcon, Consensys, and similar gatherings have incorporated an NFT component to attendance, either as the way to enter the venue or as mementos of the event itself.\nYet, this practice has mostly been limited to crypto-related events. The industry at large has seen increasing interest in the use of NFTs, but the complexity of the technology has prevented mass adoption in more mainstream gatherings.\nHowever, this is slowly changing. Many NFT projects are also focusing on creating low-code or no-code solutions for NFT tickets. This would allow event planners the ability to generate the tickets without having to hire a dedicated team of blockchain developers. These new platforms can foster the mass adoption of NFTs from another industry and bring more users into the blockchain.\nOne such platform is NMKR which is simplifying the entire process of minting NFTs for a variety of tokenization use cases including ticketing on top of Cardano. It has created a set of tools that allow web developers to integrate blockchain technology into services without having to know how to code smart contracts or any of the associated technologies.\nThe advantages of using NFTs for event ticketing include simplicity (only have to carry a smartphone and wallet with the NFT), prevention of ticket scalping (NFT metadata contains relevant purchasing information that blocks scalpers and allows fairer access for anyone to purchase tickets), proof-of-attendance, and more.\nRelated reading: NMKR s tokenization platform helps businesses to maximize brand impact\nDecentralized subscriptions have often been a technology that blockchain projects have aimed to deliver. The benefits of creating subscription services that do not track or record the users information are numerous. Yet, this has proven to be very difficult.\nNFTs offer a solution. An NFT can record the terms of a subscription such as the price, the duration, the level of access, and the rewards of the subscription. The site would need to check a wallet for an NFT before allowing access to the services.\nDolce and Gabbana, the popular fashion brand, is experimenting with this concept. They have released nine exclusive NFTs that give the owners exclusive access to the brand s VIP services. This means access to events, clothing collections, and special deals.\nThis seems straightforward as NFTs have always been about ownership of media. The images attached to the metadata of the NFT are the pieces of art that make the token valuable, not the numbers recorded on a blockchain. But there are many other digital items this model can expand to.\nVideo games have increasingly been distributed fully digitally, with some titles abandoning physical media altogether. There are many advantages to this model, but one major drawback is that there is no way to resell the game once the return window is over. If a buyer doesn t like the game, they are stuck with the digital copy forever.\nNFTs can change this modality by allowing the resale of a digital item or goods. This is already happening with digital books. Book.io releases full digital books as NFTs. Any person can buy these and later resell them, sometimes for a profit, either peer-to-peer or on marketplaces.\nNFTs have the potential to allow ownership of digital goods that also have a secondary market. People can take their digital copies and pass them to another person when they no longer have a use for them.\nThis would also increase the need for secondary marketplaces to facilitate safe and secure NFT transactions.\nAre you looking for more information on tokenization using blockchain technology?\nEMURGO is partnered with NFT and Tokenization platform NMKR to drive adoption and awareness of the ease and valuable utility of asset tokenization, especially for businesses and creators.\nFollow EMURGO on X to receive updates about the partnership and future events with NMKR.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "input": "",
    "output": "August 22, 2024\nEMURGO\nAn often overlooked aspect of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) is their power to create and grow passionate communities. This is an immense benefit, especially for Web3 projects and even traditional businesses, where its members and consumers can be spread all over the world, speak different languages, and come from various cultures.\nGlobal communities united by a common interest, issue, or value, need something to bind them together and create that sense of belonging which is crucial to the sustained success of brands, organizations, and others.\nAs awareness of blockchain technology continues to expand, NFTs are now starting to emerge as a modern, powerful tool to bridge individuals and forge strong communities.\nThis blog will discuss the five ways in which NFTs achieve this.\nBrands, organizations, and projects trying to build an audience or consumer base face the challenge of reaching their desired target demographic. Especially if the brand or personality is rather unestablished and aiming to go global, this is often a much more complicated barrier to navigate.\nThere are media and marketing companies that can help to promote, but these are often fragmented across different regions and countries with cultural barriers to also consider. This can make it difficult to reach a target audience.\nRelated reading:\nFor many brands, creators, and projects that are non-digital, establishing lines of direct communication can be limited and instead go through third-party centralized platforms such as social media applications. This can sometimes prevent them from portraying the exact narrative and messaging they would like to present to their customers.\nThis is where NFTs can serve as a solution for brands and projects by using customers digital wallets to identify their audience which can then enable direct content distribution without having to go through a centralized third-party platform.\nOnce brands and projects have a direct channel to their audience via wallets and NFTs, this can lead to the next step. Here, curated content can be distributed directly to those who have the NFTs in their wallet.\nA variety of creative products and brand promotions can be crafted to enhance customer engagement and strengthen brand loyalty.\nFor example, a brand or project could offer larger rewards to those holding their NFTs for longer periods or allow customers/users to redeem NFTs for other in-demand goods or services.\nThe opportunity this type of access provides is unparalleled in the industry.\nRead more: How to protect against popular wallet scams\nNFTs can create a bond between a brand or project and its community members. This can be used to create tailored experiences for the members that enhance their sense of belonging.\nExamples could be special discussion spaces, direct access to Q&As, exclusive events, and many other things. More incentives to participate in both online and offline events for NFT holders can create the grounds for more interactions and bonding to occur between community members interested in a particular brand or project.\nNFTs can become the conduit to greater engagement and passion.\nAs mentioned above, NFTs can help to establish a direct line of communication with its customers or audience. They can also be used to conduct special promotional activities and fan engagement initiatives.\nOnce these have been established, using NFTs can also be used to identify passionate members within a brand or project s community. Passionate and influential NFT holders could stand out in online discussion forums and social media. They can support a brand or project to take a better pulse of their community and work with them to craft additional campaigns to grow their community by meeting the wishes of their members.\nNFTs can enable brands and projects to digitally monetize. They can distribute exclusive content, subscription services, licensing, etc. in the form of NFTs. By knowing their audience and having a direct communication line with them, NFTs can be the cornerstone of a whole host of new ways to monetize media and content for a brand to distribute or sell to their customers.\nOnce customers or users become passionate about a brand or project, they naturally become promotional ambassadors to others thereby fueling community expansion and the potential for greater sales.\nAlso, these strategies would be launched on top of a decentralized blockchain ledger, meaning the users then can purchase the NFTs without hidden fees and unfavorable exchange rates if using cryptocurrencies for payments.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain.

    "instruction": "Cardano NFTs 10 Most Frequently Asked Questions FAQs EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "September 6, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) made inroads into mainstream pop culture in 2021 and 2022. They attracted the attention of big companies, media personalities, influencers, and brands, and became a trendy buzzword.\nDespite their popularity, many misconceptions remain regarding the nature and value of NFTs. This has led to misunderstandings about its use cases and the underlying blockchain technology, with some being quick to write them off as a fad focused on the trading of digital images.\nThis blog aims to give clear answers to commonly asked questions about NFTs, in particular those issued on the Cardano blockchain, and give users a better understanding.\nAn NFT is a type of digital asset issued on a blockchain network that has a unique ID to distinguish it from others. The identifier is used to single out a particular digital token from other token types and also within a particular NFT collection. Thus, it is non-fungible.\nThis property means that developers and businesses can mint and use NFTs to represent a wide range of unique properties or assets, not just pictures and images.\nThis ability opens up a whole host of use cases that NFTs can be adapted for or created on their own, such as the tokenization of a variety of assets.\nRelated reading:\nIn the Cardano blockchain network, NFTs follow what is called the native token model.\nAssets are independent entities on the blockchain ledger and do not require a smart contract to be created or to exist. This model provides more power and flexibility to blockchain developers and businesses looking to create NFTs leveraging the Cardano blockchain.\nA Cardano NFT is identified by a Policy ID. This is a unique identifier that is generated by a mining script used to create a token. It sets apart an NFT from other assets recorded on the Cardano blockchain.\nMetadata is data, or information, about the token. It s a field that can be used to express many details about a particular asset.\nIn an NFT collection, metadata is where the creator creates the naming convention of each NFT.\nOther uses of metadata and NFTs are relevant and necessary information related to the NFT such as details of a contract between parties, transaction history, source of origin, etc.\nFor example, if an NFT is created to digitally represent a physical diamond, the metadata can have information such as when and where the diamond was mined, authentication certifications, etc.\nIn Cardano, the capacity of token metadata is bigger than compared to other traditional blockchains. Hence, NFTs on Cardano can contain more data.\nRead more: NFTs and token metadata 101\nMost times, NFTs are paired with some sort of media file that interests a user or prospective buyer. These can be images on an NFT collection, short animations, sounds, music, etc. However, these files are usually too large to be recorded on a blockchain economically.\nFor this reason, a supplemental technology has emerged that provides decentralized storage for these files. Networks like AIOZ Network are used to upload the media of the NFT and the hash of it is recorded on the metadata of the asset.\nRead more: What is decentralized storage?\nIn principle no.\nAn NFT is a digital asset that does not have decimals like regular tokens do. A user cannot sell or transfer half of an NFT to another person. On a distributed blockchain ledger such as Cardano, they are digitally recorded as single units that cannot be broken down.\nIn some cases, an NFT can become so valuable that a single individual may not have enough resources to buy it single-handedly. This is where NFT fractionalization comes into the picture.\nWhile the original NFT is locked in a smart contract, the code of the contract creates fractions that represent partial ownership of an NFT. These fractions can then be freely traded by those who buy them through marketplaces or peer-to-peer.\nFor example, if an NFT were to represent a specific type of real estate, fractionalization could potentially enable multiple buyers to purchase, own, and trade portions of that particular property.\nThere are two main ways to purchase an NFT.\nFirst, is from the primary source, or the developer(s) that creates an NFT collection which is a series of NFTs that have a unique theme. They can release an NFT sale via a platform they create or via a third party that provides NFT minting and selling such as NMKR an NFT and tokenization service using the Cardano blockchain.\nSecond, is on the secondary market. Initial buyers resell their NFTs on specialized marketplaces that can sell the asset for a fixed price or as an auction. In either case, the buyer is purchasing the NFT from a previous owner and not the original creators.\nRead more: How NMKR tokenized physical diamonds\nOn Cardano, an NFT or an NFT collection is searched using the Policy ID. This identifier can be used to retrieve all the assets minted using it, such as within an NFT collection, or single tokens that have said ID.\nHowever, searching for new NFTs that are about to be launched is different. The best way would be to follow NFT platforms such as NMKR, which provide information on new and upcoming NFT collections minted on their platform.\nAnother way to find NFTs is through Discord NFT communities where creators start promoting their upcoming drops. NFT collectors can then be ahead of the general public when looking for new NFTs that have the potential to become popular.\nOn Cardano, an NFT is created using a minting script. The script generates the Policy ID of the NFT, the size of the collection, the information on the metadata, and other details. A script can be generated using the Cardano-cli or with a smart contract.\nAnother simpler way is by using an NFT minting platform. This could be a dApp (decentralized application) that provides a service for minting NFTs using no-code solutions such as graphical interfaces or APIs.\nNMKR is an established NFT platform service that allows anyone to easily create and sell NFTs without having to be a smart contract developer. Removing this technical barrier opens up access to NFTs for businesses and individuals looking to integrate Web3 technologies.\nThis is a misconception that comes from two sources. First, the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm used by Bitcoin can be very energy-intensive. Second, as NFTs first appeared on Ethereum, many were concerned about their environmental impact when it was a PoW network before it transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS).\nCardano was designed from its inception to be an environmentally friendly proof-of-stake network by employing an energy-efficient protocol. Statistics show Cardano to be significantly greener and compliant with the EU s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) sustainability indicators.\nOn Cardano, the native asset model allows for the ownership of an asset to be fully transferred to a buyer. On other networks, NFTs are created using smart contracts. If the code in the contract is compromised, the NFT can be deleted from the blockchain ledger including the one bought by users.\nCardano has created a different model where assets are entities on the blockchain ledger. Once an NFT is minted and a user buys it, the asset becomes the whole property of the buyer. Even if the original creators stop promoting the NFT or maintaining the website, the NFT itself will always be part of the ledger and property of the owner.\nNMKR is an NFT and Tokenization platform service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to easily create NFTs by providing tools that do not require coding knowledge.\nAs an established platform, NMKR s services have been used by businesses, gaming projects, creators, and more to successfully mint NFTs of various assets.\nInterested in learning more about NFT use cases and NMKR s tokenization service?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for regular updates and content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "October 27, 2022\nAlbert Kim\nDeveloped by EMURGO, one of the founding entities of Cardano, Yoroi Wallet launched in August 2018 as the first Cardano blockchain light wallet for ADA cryptocurrency users.\nAs a light wallet, Yoroi enables ADA holders to quickly store, send, receive, and stake ADA without having to download an entire copy of the Cardano blockchain. ADA users can also use Yoroi Wallet to register to vote for Project Catalyst a decentralized funding and governance platform driven by ADA holders on Cardano.\nYoroi is also open-source so it s being maintained in a transparent way for the Cardano community.\nYoroi currently has versions available for both mobile (Android/iOS) and desktop (Chrome/Firefox/Edge) and is also compatible with hardware wallets Ledger and Trezor.\nIn this blog, we will list 8 things you can do with Yoroi Wallet.\nEven with all these features, there will be even more to come in the pipeline.\nYoroi connects to both Ledger and Trezor crypto hardware wallets on the Cardano blockchain.\nConnecting Yoroi to a hardware wallet adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind.\nYour Cardano ADA is securely stored in the hardware wallet, while Yoroi is used as the gateway to interact with dApps, and transactions using ADA.\nCardano is one of the largest proof-of-stake blockchains by market capitalization and an eco-friendly open-source blockchain.\nAs a proof-of-stake blockchain, staking your ADA cryptocurrency is the cornerstone of the security in the Cardano blockchain, and users are rewarded with ADA as an incentive.\nStaking on Cardano is liquid by default meaning that users always have complete control to stake and un-stake their ADA as long as they are using a self-custodial or non-custodial wallet such as Yoroi.\nThis is a key differentiating feature from other proof-of-stake (POS) blockchains that require users to lock their cryptocurrencies or tokens without the ability to freely withdraw them at any given time.\nIt s the way Cardano stake pool operators (SPOs) and delegators collaborate to create a decentralized and secure network for decentralized applications (dApps) running on Cardano.\nCurrently, there are more than 3.9 million active ADA wallet addresses and more than 3,200 Cardano SPOs with nearly 73 of all ADA in circulation being staked to secure the Cardano blockchain.\nSince the beginning, Yoroi was designed to allow ADA users to directly stake from the wallet interface. The Cardano blockchain and Yoroi Wallet are unique in that they offer liquid, self-custodial staking whereby users can stake and un-stake ADA at their discretion.\nOn the Yoroi dashboard, users can see their current delegated and staked ADA, and accumulated rewards. From the Delegation List, a user can search for a particular stake pool to delegate and stake, or see the statistics of all the pools to choose one to delegate and stake.\nAdditionally, from the Dashboard, you can also tap the eye icon next to the balance, to make it visible or hidden.\nFrom Yoroi, transferring crypto is fast. Yoroi users can send ADA and any native token of the Cardano network to another wallet.\nAdditionally, all of the tokens in that wallet can be sent to a different address in a single transaction by selecting All ADA + Tokens from the Amount Options box.\nFrom Yoroi, a user can also receive ADA or any Cardano native token from anywhere in the world with just a few taps.\nYoroi automatically creates many addresses using the verification key and the staking key.\nThe amount of addresses created is virtually infinite, increasing the anonymity of a user s wallet.\nFrom the menu on the left, a user can check which addresses have never been used.\nFind all the addresses that have been used at least once and check which addresses have at least one UTXO.\nIn the Transactions tab, users can review all of their transactions including ADA, native tokens, and NFTs.\nThe transaction history list is ordered chronologically, and the information there can be used to double-check with any blockchain explorer supporting Cardano.\nYoroi is also able to support Cardano native tokens.\nThese assets are listed on the Assets tab.\nA user can easily see the balance, transaction history, and metadata of each asset.\nFrom the Yoroi interface, users can create transactions to move these native tokens individually to other addresses on Cardano.\nAnother amazing feature of Yoroi is the ability to participate in Cardano s Project Catalyst, a decentralized innovation fund for projects building on Cardano.\nProject Catalyst has funded more than 1,000 projects on Cardano to date.\nUsing Yoroi, a user can register to vote during each fund round with a few simple clicks.\nThe wallet will track your ADA balance and transform it into voting power.\nAdditionally, from the Reward tab in the Receive menu, a user can find their staking key.\nThis can be used to track any rewards given for voting on Project Catalyst.\nThe Yoroi dApp connector is the bridge between smart contracts and users on Cardano.\nYou can use Yoroi s dApp connector feature to track and manage Cardano dApps that are connected to your Yoroi Wallet address.\nBy pressing the trashcan icon, users can sever any connection between the wallet and a Cardano dApp.\nYoroi is an open-source wallet for Cardano ADA holders, built to be your gateway to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of dApps including DeFi and NFTs.\nAs a self-custodial wallet, the user is in complete control over their Cardano ADA at all times.\nEMURGO nor any third party can recover your Yoroi Wallet for you. Only ones with access to the correct recovery phrase can recover the wallet. If the recovery phrase is lost, there s no way to recover it.\nFollow Yoroi Wallet on Twitter to receive the latest news and updates.\nIf you need further assistance, contact Yoroi s customer help desk here and a customer support specialist shall respond within 24 hours.\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

This part impacts the scalability potential of all blockchains.\nFor the digital transfer of cryptocurrencies to be useful, the blockchain network needs to record these movements. The transfer of cryptocurrencies or tokens on a blockchain is started by the owner of the private key associated with a wallet, thus creating the transaction. This transaction informs the network about how much value is moving and its destination.\nThe system or set of rules governing this process is the Balance/Account Model.\nIn the accounting profession, many have decided to call blockchain technology triple entry bookkeeping.\nDouble entry bookkeeping is the regular practice where debits and credits are recorded in a single ledger. In contrast, triple entry bookkeeping adds the security of having that book, or ledger, copied across many nodes in a decentralized network.\nThat ledger is the state of the network.\nSystems are said to have a state if they were designed to remember preceding events or user interactions. This recorded information is what we would normally call the state of the system. A distributed ledger like a blockchain, by its very nature, has a state, which needs to be recorded according to a set of objective rules.\nThe Balance or Account Model is precisely the way a network records these interactions.\nAfter a network has been launched, changing this model is an enormously difficult task that has never been successfully done in a fully live network.\nIt s crucial to understand it for anyone looking to seriously develop dApps on a blockchain.\nThere are two standard ways to determine how transactions are recorded by a distributed ledger, Global Balance and Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO).\nThe UTXO model is a more abstract concept comparatively.\nYet, UTXO is the initial Accounting Model for decentralized ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin in 2008.\nThe Global Balance model was introduced by first generation smart contract blockchains.\nCardano s blockchain utilizes the UTXO model to increase scalability for its ability to process transactions in parallel. But, the original UTXO model had to be extended to account for smart contract computations.\nBelow, we will discuss both of these models in more detail.\nThe Global Balance system was taken from digital banking in near identical fashion.\nThe Ethereum blockchain was the first to introduce it to the blockchain world in the Ethereum Yellow Paper. It is named in that text as world state which manages account balances and smart contract computations.\nThe state on Ethereum is a part of its base protocol and forms the single transaction layer of its blockchain. This means that the state being recorded by its ledger is entirely based on transactions.\nEthereum doesn t actually have independent assets that can be called tokens. Instead, it has smart contracts that record interactions in the form of transactions.\nThese in turn make the state of the Ethereum ledger and are recorded by its network. We can say that any movement of modification to the state on Ethereum is a transaction. The Ethereum blockchain begins existence at the genesis block. It has an index of 0, and activities after this blockchain such as transactions, smart contracts computations, and mining, will modify the state of the Ethereum blockchain.\nNow, in order to preserve the order of the state, all transactions have to be processed sequentially. This means that the network is taking all of the transactions broadcasted to the ledger and queuing them in a single file. Each is processed when their turn arrives.\nUnder this Global Balance Model, the Ethereum network has to be aware of the state of the entire system including balances across all different crypto wallets, all the tokens on the ledger, all NFTs minted, and so on.\nIt s important to note that data such as account balances are not stored directly in the blocks of the Ethereum blockchain. Only the root node hashes of the transaction tree, state tree and receipts tree are stored directly in the blocks.\nThis linear system prevents the ledger from changing the history of the transactions and prevents any sort of parallelizing processing since that would break the model.\nThe blockchains using a Global Balance must process transactions one by one. Even those that are unrelated, like the purchase of an NFT and a Uniswap token exchange, have to be put in a serial line.\nThis sacrifice is what allows these networks to have a simpler transaction structure. In them, direct debits of a balance are possible.\nFor example, if a user has 100 X tokens in my crypto wallet, the user can subtract 50 X tokens and send them to another wallet address.\nThe UTXO way to record a state is more abstract, but it opens the possibility to having parallel transactions.\nThe eUTXO model was first pioneered by Bitcoin and later adopted by most first generation blockchains.\nThe first generation blockchains only have one asset in their ledgers, their native cryptocurrency, and the system is less cumbersome.\nThe state in these distributed ledgers is represented by a global aggregation of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs).\nThese represent the movement of value in the network whenever a transaction happens. This means, a user on one of these blockchains is able to spend one, or more, of their UTXOs by creating a transaction and adding one or more of their UTXOs as the transaction s input.\nThis accounting model of UTXO makes Cardano and Bitcoin different from Ethereum and other Global Balance blockchains.\nLet s illustrate an example to understand the difference.\nExample\nIn Bitcoin s blockchain, a UTXO cannot be partially spent. If a user has 1 Bitcoin (BTC) in a crypto wallet and spends 0.5 BTC, the system will create a second transaction that sends back 0.5 BTC in return as change.\nInstead of thinking of the balance as a fully fractionalized account, we can think of UTXOs as physical money.\nIf I have a $5 bill in my pocket and I want a candy bar that costs $2.50, I can give the vendor the $5 bill, and the vendor can return two $1 bills and a fifty-cent coin in change.\nFor this reason, at the level of the core protocol, UTXO blockchains don t maintain account balances. The user simply holds the private keys to one or more UTXOs at any given point in time. Crypto wallets make it seem like the blockchain is automatically storing and organizing the users account balances, but that is not the case.\nIn UTXO blockchains, the crypto wallet is doing a lot of heavy lifting. These are in charge of:\nConcurrency is a concept in computer science that refers to the ability of a system to execute two or more tasks at the same time (in parallel).\nThe UTXO model introduced was designed to be able to do this on the Bitcoin network.\nThat is the main reason why Cardano chose to extend the UTXO model and adapt it to smart contracts.\nUTXOs can be processed by the ledger in parallel if they are not related.\nFor example, a transaction between two friends and a third user buying an NFT have no relation between each other. The UTXO used are controlled by different private keys, and can be broadcasted to the network at nearly the same time.\nThis gives enormous power to the ledger to scale, as unrelated transactions don t have to be artificially ordered according to some history.\nRegular transactions and other dApps benefit greatly by the use of UTXOs, and that is one of the main advantages Cardano has over the other protocols that rely on a Global Balance.\nClick to pick the right EMURGO Academy blockchain course for you!\nAs the official commercial arm and a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain, EMURGO is uniquely positioned to leverage its extensive knowledge of Cardano s technical development to offer curated educational courses on Cardano to interested students.\nAll courses are taught by professional instructors with actual blockchain experience.\nEMURGO Academy, EMURGO s education unit, has now expanded to offer six different courses on Cardano to a range of student types interested in becoming a Cardano developer, becoming a Cardano entrepreneur, becoming a Cardano business analyst/consultant, and more.\nFor more information on each of the courses and to contact a representative, please visit the link here now!\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "The 5 Most Promising Real Use Cases for DeFi EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "December 12, 2023\nEMURGO\nDeFi (decentralized finance) is now entering an exciting period of development where its real use cases are being more acknowledged, adopted, and scaled for more users after an initial experimentation phase led by early adopters. Now, DeFi is much more well-known in the blockchain community and starting to be discussed in traditional financial circles.\nThe task of identifying these real DeFi use cases can be a daunting one as DeFi has been characterized as being very innovative and fast-paced with several projects having launched on different decentralized blockchain networks.\nIn this blog, we ll go over five of the most promising use cases for DeFi and explain their potential benefits for users.\nAt first, stablecoins (digital tokens backed 1:1 by a fiat currency) may seem to not be part of DeFi, yet they are at the core of the space. It is an asset class that can be used for immediate payments, cross-border remittances, a haven from volatility, a long-term store of value, and more, which holds immense value for individual users, enterprises, and organizations.\nThe stablecoin is also a complex asset. How it maintains its peg to a regularly accepted currency is crucial for its proper functioning. There are three ways to do this:\nEach type of stablecoin has its place in the DeFi ecosystem of a network. All are needed for the growth of DeFi.\nRead more: What s the difference between CeFi and DeFi?\nIn the developing world, they also are playing a pivotal role. In many regions, inflation is causing economic distress, and certain governments are implementing capital controls to prevent citizens from buying US dollars which are deemed to be more stable . In these regions, stablecoins are providing an alternative way for these people to protect themselves from their currency devaluation and engage in economic activity through an internet connection.\nSometimes overlooked, the quick settlement of cross-border transactions is a significant problem worldwide. Networks such as SWIFT are built using outdated technology and are slow and expensive to use. Financial institutions are open to looking for cheaper options that are also more efficient.\nThe decentralized nature of blockchain and its programmable smart contracts are perfect for this type of problem. They can settle transactions between financial institutions or multiple parties across all types of physical borders without any intermediaries. Transactions can be bundled or even programmed to autonomously self-execute if certain conditions are met with complete transparency and accountability.\nUsing DeFi products & services built on top of decentralized blockchain technology, global cross-border payments can be instantaneous with immediate settlement, and lower fees.\nNot everyone has access to global financial markets, which are located in a few centralized locations in the developed world. This can pose a drawback to certain people who are unable to access services based on such traditional financial markets. The blockchain and DeFi have a solution called synthetic assets.\nCommodities, stocks, gold, oil, national currencies, and other traditional assets have the potential to be digitally represented on a decentralized blockchain and can be made to mirror the behavior of the original asset. These synthetic assets can give market access to anyone around the world to markets that would be close to them.\nMany markets can be simulated using cryptocurrencies and made to track the underlying asset. This has created a new type of market where people can get exposure to gold, oil, soybeans, and other types of commodities without having to own the asset itself while benefiting from the unique value proposition of crypto-based DeFi products and services such as fractional ownership, fast settlement, open access, and more.\nAnother type of DeFi product is borrowing and lending marketplaces. Here, loans are permissionless meaning that any person that meets collateral requirements can immediately get a loan and use it for other purposes. Access to such services is decentralized and more accessible than having to go through a centralized financial institution.\nThese lending marketplaces can be used by traders and others looking for yield and those looking for more accessible credit. There is still a way to go to raise awareness and drive more adoption of these services, but the idea is gaining more traction as time passes and developers are consistently working to improve these services.\nThese kinds of marketplaces can hold appeal for those lacking access to basic financial services for various reasons such as poor credit or a lack of credit history, bank account, etc.\nMarkets in the real world are difficult to make global or have them attract liquidity at the very beginning. This is especially so in developing countries, but DeFi is a potential solution with the ability to tokenize assets.\nTokenization means taking the characteristics of a real-world asset and creating a digital representation of it that is recorded on a decentralized blockchain. The difference with synthetic assets is that the underlying asset is not needed in the former, while in the latter, the original asset is incorporated into the ledger.\nThis creates an immediate global market for the tokenized item and also access to liquidity via the blockchain network. Almost anything can be tokenized, including real estate property, intellectual property such as artwork and music, and shares of bonds. Since these are digitally recorded and maintained, ownership and transactions can be fractionalized and traded globally with fast settlement.\nRead more: EMURGO presents in front of Wyoming Stable Token Commission\nClick here to sign up\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are teaming up to offer a special 2-day workshop on DeFi to businesses and professionals in Singapore.\nThis 2-day DeFi workshop aims to provide a well-rounded understanding of both blockchain and DeFi (decentralized finance), enabling attendees to make informed decisions, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of this innovative financial space.

    "input": "",
    "output": "February 10, 2023\nAlbert Kim\nFor instance, there is a self-custodial crypto wallet in which the user retains full control over their cryptocurrencies and their private key at all times.\nThere is also a custodial or third-party custodial wallet in which a third party retains control and manages the cryptocurrencies on the user s behalf. This requires that the user places their trust in the third party to manage the cryptocurrencies in good faith. A cryptocurrency exchange wallet is a good example of this type of non-custodial wallet.\nThis interest in self-custody has extended to not only crypto wallets but all aspects of decentralized blockchain technology.\nCompared to other proof-of-stake blockchains, Cardano possesses unique technical design features that enable simple self-custody of Cardano ADA and Cardano native tokens even while staking to earn rewards.\nCardano ADA holders can always retain full control over their stake and withdraw their stake at any time if they use a self-custodial wallet.\nThe Cardano blockchain uses a unique staking mechanism based on Game Theory rather than slashing.\nThe complete outline of how it works can be found in the Ouroboros whitepaper, but it s been proven to work and tested on various conditions. Ouroboros is the name of the proof-of-stake protocol that secures Cardano s decentralized blockchain.\nThe implications of Cardano s design choice are:\nThe custody of the ADA cryptocurrency delegated to a Cardano stake pool is always under the control of the private key of the owner. For this reason, delegation for Cardano ADA staking purposes poses no loss of ownership risk to the owner of the ADA.\nCardano ADA holders can easily download and use self-custodial wallets such as Yoroi to stake ADA directly from their wallet on both mobile and desktop browser versions while retaining full control over their ADA.\nMore: How to stake Cardano ADA using Yoroi Wallet\nThis low-risk approach has created a funding mechanism unique to the Cardano blockchain, the Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO).\nIn an ISPO, ADA holders delegate to a Cardano staking pool from a specific project building on Cardano, the project keeps a varying percentage of the staking rewards to fund its project development, and the delegators receive the project s token.\nThe delegators know that their ADA can never be taken, and they accept the risk of losing their ADA rewards in exchange for the project s tokens.\nThis can help fund in part new Cardano projects, plus it attracts a lot of new users to projects that engage in an ISPO.\nAnother feature of self-custodial staking is hardware wallet delegation.\nAll major wallet manufacturers in the blockchain industry support hardware wallet delegation for Cardano ADA.\nThis means users can hold ADA in their hardware device, and still get the benefits and rewards from delegation and staking.\nThis increases security as the private key of a hardware wallet is offline and the user further protects the cryptocurrencies in their wallet. The Cardano blockchain network still calculates the rewards based on the amount of ADA delegated from the wallet.\nMore: How to connect Yoroi to Ledger Wallet\nOnce the rewards have accumulated, the owner can withdraw them and send them directly to the hardware wallet. The added layer of security ensures the ADA is protected from potential attackers, and the user doesn t need to sacrifice the staking rewards of the Cardano blockchain network.\nThis careful approach to Proof-of-Stake has resulted in a much more robust and secure consensus mechanism for the Cardano blockchain. At the same time, the design choices have also made it a better user experience for ADA users looking to accumulate rewards while securing the Cardano blockchain network.\nYoroi is an open-source and the first crypto light wallet for Cardano ADA holders. It allows Cardano ADA holders to store, send, receive, and stake Cardano ADA for rewards and to secure Cardano s decentralized blockchain.\nAvailable for mobile and desktop browsers, Yoroi is designed to be your gateway to Cardano s Web3 ecosystem of dApps including Cardano DeFi, Cardano NFTs, and the USDA stablecoin.\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "output": "September 24, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe Cardano Constitution becomes the center of attention as the road to the Cardano Constitutional Convention approaches its destination.\nThe Cardano blockchain network is transitioning completely to a fully distributed governance structure, whereby the community will be responsible for maintaining and upgrading the network according to its needs.\nWith a global base of members and stakeholders, the Constitution aims to be a foundational document that clearly outlines the principles and rules the community must uphold for Cardano to be a distributed blockchain truly.\nLet s examine this important document in more detail and consider its role in governing Cardano.\nOnce ratified and enacted, the Cardano Constitution will outline the different governance mechanisms, institutions, and responsibilities of all the members within the Cardano ecosystem.\nLike the Constitution of any nation, it will serve as the cornerstone that guides and anchors all of the other processes and developments Cardano will need moving forward.\nThe Cardano Constitution has yet to be formally drafted and presented for ratification by the community. In its place, there is an interim Cardano Constitution that is part of the first Chang Hard Fork upgrade and can be viewed here. It is a temporary document that will serve to bootstrap Cardano s governance era and help in the transition to the enactment of the official Cardano Constitution.\nThe expected timeline is for the Constitution to be drafted and presented by delegates at the Cardano Constitutional Convention for a community vote.\nTo reach that point, the community is hosting a series of constitutional workshops around the world with the support of Intersect to gather various opinions and insights that should be included in the draft.\nRelated reading:\nThe drafting of the Cardano Constitution will be the culmination of a process that started more than a year ago, it began with CIP-1694 and in-person CIP-1694 workshops. CIP-1694 is a Community Cardano Improvement Proposal outlining the on-chain tools, features, and other governance-related focuses needed to govern Cardano effectively.\nIntersect, a member-based organization supporting the distributed governance of the Cardano blockchain, has organized dozens of global workshops in different countries to discuss matters related to the Constitution. These are ongoing in the latter half of 2024.\nOnce the workshops have concluded, all their feedback will be collected so every community member can access it. These important insights will be used to draft the first version of the official Constitution later at the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires, Argentina (December 2024).\nFeedback from these workshops can be found here.\nThese workshops will also discuss the choice of local delegates for the convention. These delegates will then participate in workshops at the Convention to prepare the Constitution s first presentation.\nAfter a series of workshops at the Convention, the final draft of the Cardano Constitution should be ready for the community to ratify. The entire Cardano community will have time to review it and process the information contained in the document.\nThe community will come together to either approve the document or reject it.\nIf approved, the text of the Cardano Constitution will be hashed and added to the Cardano network. Every stake pool in the network will have a copy of the Constitution, and the hash will be made public so everyone can review it.\nThere are different stages to the Cardano Constitution:\nRead more: What is the interim Cardano Constitution?\nTo receive more information on Cardano governance and Intersect, follow EMURGO on X and LinkedIn for blogs, announcements, events, and other related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Here Are 5 Tips to Become a Cardano Blockchain Developer EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "December 5, 2023\nEMURGO\nCardano blockchain development is moving fast and creating many opportunities for developers. In recent months, it has also become much more user-friendly as several Cardano developer tools are making it easier and faster to do so.\nThis has opened the way for many developers from other fields to jump into Cardano and its ecosystem. The rewards for doing so are quite substantial and the career change could open opportunities for people from all over the world.\nOf course, moving to a new field of development and ecosystem can be daunting. The purpose of this blog is to give some advice and tips on how to ease the transition and start a successful Cardano blockchain developer career.\nThe best way to start is to do so from the get-go. It may seem that learning about distributed systems, blockchain, and finally Haskell is the best path to enter the Cardano ecosystem. But that road will be detrimental. By the time you think you are ready to jump into Cardano, the network will be different as it s constantly developing and advancing very fast.\nA good way might be to start directly exploring Cardano development. Anything else you need like Haskell, blockchain knowledge, and the rest you can pick up along the way. You can then be immersed from the start into the Cardano ecosystem and move faster to the final goal of blockchain development.\nExperiment and start today. Get to the point where you are building stuff.\nWhen you reach a stage where you start seeing where you need to improve, look at building the base and strength required to jump to the next level through professional certifications and strong exposure.\nThe journey to becoming a Cardano blockchain developer doesn t have to be a lonesome one. The Cardano community is very large and many are in different stages on the path to becoming developers. There is a wealth of knowledge and experience that can come from interacting with the community.\nThere are many places where one can find these communities:\nThese are just to name a few. There are many other places where you can find like-minded people and those similarly looking to enter the Cardano ecosystem. The advantage of getting to know and interacting with others in the ecosystem is very valuable in the long term.\nRead more: Here are 5 useful Cardano developer tools\nOnce you know the Cardano landscape and where in smart contract development you want to enter, the next stage is picking a Cardano dApp project.\nIt could be writing a small smart contract that has some functionality, integrating a wallet on a website, or writing off-chain code for a validator. The project has to reflect your interest and serve as a goal of the type of development you want to enter.\nCardano is a global blockchain that opens opportunities to people from all regions of the world. The switch to this new career path can seem intimidating at first, but also very rewarding. The switch doesn t have to be abrupt and instead can start with small steps.\nAs a follow-up to the first advice, joining projects early on is also important. Even without being proficient in Cardano smart contract development, projects need all types of people. Many are looking for web developers, back-end devs., and any help in general.\nThe best place to look for these small projects is on Catalyst.\nProject Catalyst is a funding network for Cardano where teams can seek some funding, network with each other, and start collaborating.\nIt s an invaluable space to find those first connections. The projects in the platform tend to be early stage and look for all types of collaborators. In there, many can find a good fit and start the Cardano journey.\nWhile learning smart contract development on Cardano is very fulfilling, it is also equally important for others in the ecosystem to know about your developer progression. Having an active and updated profile is very valuable as others can find out about the progress of a person or the current projects of said individual. This can lead to more gigs, employment, or even startup co-founding opportunities.\nThere are two main ways to achieve this: GitHub or Gitlab, and the X (erstwhile Twitter) platform. Developer commits are what best shows the progress of a developer.\nGitHub can help you showcase your best efforts as a portfolio of projects. In the context of Cardano development, popular programming language choices for smart contract development are Haskell and PlutusTX, but also there are other alternatives like Aiken based on Rust and Plu-ts based on TypeScript. A profile that shows projects written in these languages can be a powerful edge.\nRead more: What s the difference between Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe?\nWhile the scope/complexity of a project is also important, being an active committer and constantly adding new commits is what showcases your effort.\nIn time, building a portfolio of showcase projects is one of the most valuable tools to present oneself. The Cardano community is very active in this regard, so they are fond of these tools.\nX/Twitter has a HUGE active crypto and Cardano community which can help you in many ways. Cardano has a sizable community there, so being active in threads, project launches, and news is also crucial. The people in Cardano often communicate on the platform and it is a great way to make introductions.\nAre you looking to become a Cardano developer and want a full online blockchain course to guide you from beginning to end?\nThen, go to EMURGO Academy, EMURGO s education unit, to learn more about blockchain education courses and to enroll now.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "The Basics of DePINs and Decentralized Storage EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "May 14, 2024\nEMURGO\nDePINs (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) are a relatively new field of blockchain technology that is increasing in awareness.\nWhile much attention has been given to real-world asset tokenization, NFTs, and DeFi, the benefits of DePINs also present more real use cases for blockchain.\nThese days, everyday consumer items utilize a connective network infrastructure that is usually provided and administered by centralized parties. These include cellphone networks, the internet, supply chains, water and electricity, and more. Some of these infrastructure networks undoubtedly benefit from having a centralized actor to make for more efficient processes in distribution.\nHowever, some networks could benefit from having a more decentralized structure for reasons related to security, accountability, transparency, and more.\nThis is where DePINs can offer a potential solution.\nLet s dig deeper into DePINs and their different types.\nBlockchain technology has been around for more than a decade and is being looked at or used for a wide range of potential uses in finance, supply chains, data management, and more. Decentralized blockchain technology, in particular, provides a digital way to transparently record and store vital information in a trustless manner without a need for a centralized administrator through the distribution and upkeep of this information on a network of nodes (servers) that are incentivized to maintain the network in the form of a cryptocurrency or digital token.\nRelated reading:\nThis unique property has the potential to provide benefits for many businesses and industries where data keeping can be securely and reliably automated with accountability and transparency. Centralized actors and certain stakeholders would need to be less relied upon by others to faithfully carry out their responsibilities.\nThis brings us to DePINs which applies the beneficial properties of decentralized blockchain technology and digital tokens to infrastructure networks.\nInstead of having a centralized party pay upfront and control a network, a group can use reward incentives to bootstrap or build a new type of network or distribution channel.\nIndividual users would be incentivized in the form of digital tokens to participate in DePINs by lending their hardware to increase overall network connectivity and expand coverage. Those who provide access where the network has not yet developed can get more token rewards than those located in areas with network coverage. Tokens can be used for other transactions as well.\nThe result would be a self-organizing infrastructure network that incentivizes expansion via user participation, instead of a large upfront investment by a centralized entity. DePINs offer a potential new model that merges network infrastructure construction and maintenance with digital blockchain technology.\nDePINs can be extended to many types of network infrastructure.\nGenerally, it can divided into two camps:\nBoth types of networks require resources to be built. This is where the incentivization mechanism is used.\nThese require hardware to multiply and provide coverage to an industry, geographical area, or economic activity. In a traditional model, these networks would be deployed by a company paying the investment upfront keeping all the profits for itself, and also trying to gather as much user data as possible.\nIn a DePIN model, the hardware deployments could be tracked by a digital blockchain.\nOnce a new device connects to the network, the user who placed it begins receiving a reward from the network itself. Users are rewarded by deploying hardware in areas with low coverage, naturally extending the reach of the service.\nOne example is IoT devices.\nA blockchain-based project using DePINs can reward users who place nodes that allow the network to track shipment across regions. This allows the company to track its shipments faster and cheaper. The users get more rewards by deploying sensors along the different shipment routes.\nIn time, the network would extend its coverage until it covers all the shipment routes that companies use to move cargo. The network charges the companies for the service and distributes the rewards to everyone maintaining the nodes.\nIf new routes were to open, the users could react by deploying more sensors and getting higher early rewards. This creates a network that can potentially self-expand and quickly reshape to cover new areas of economic activity.\nAnother type of DePIN network is in digital infrastructure.\nThe idea is to have a network able to provide a service delivered via the Internet. This is where computational resources are shared to a larger whole.\nOne example is decentralized storage networks such as AIOZ Network.\nIn decentralized storage, users delegate a portion of their hard drives to these networks which in turn, rent the space to other users looking to store information.\nThe network can encrypt the stored data and divide it into smaller chunks. No one computer has a copy of the data of the users, so theoretically, there is more privacy in decentralized storage than when using cloud solutions.\nThese decentralized storage networks use digital token incentives to attract more delegators. Those looking to buy storage space need to pay with that network s token, creating a circular economy.\nInterested in learning more DePINs and use cases for blockchain technology?\nEMURGO is a supporter of AIOZ Network s launch of its W3IPFS (Web3 Interplanetary File System) solution, a decentralized, secure, high-speed, and scalable file storage solution powered by 74,000+ global nodes tailored for artists and creators, dApp developers, and more.\nThen, follow EMURGO on X for more about decentralized storage solutions and other Web3-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Fibo 101 What is NFT Minting and Wallet Whitelisting?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "July 26, 2022\nAlbert Kim\nAs you enter the Cardano NFT journey, there will be new concepts and lingo to learn, but we are here to help you.\nWeb3 (decentralized web running on blockchain including NFTs) has created a whole host of new words particular to the space.\nIn this blog, we ll review two of these words related to NFTs: minting and wallet whitelisting.\nSimply put, minting an NFT is the same as publishing a crypto token using blockchain to make it purchasable, or just think of it as creating an NFT on a blockchain.\nThat means the actual minted entry on the blockchain or distributed ledger is logged and the crypto asset is registered for the world to see.\nNFTs are made of different parts, and each is in charge of a separate domain of what makes an NFT.\nFirst, we have the digital media, image, music, video, etc. that will be the individual piece of art the creator wants to make purchasable.\nSecond, we have the metadata which contains all of the accompanying information to the original media including the author s name, creation date, file format, resolution, etc., and anything else that can authenticate the origin of the piece of media. On Cardano s blockchain for Cardano NFTs, the metadata is part of the transaction and added to the blockchain.\nCNFTs (as Cardano NFTs are often called) utilize the same properties of native tokens on Cardano. They are able to be transferred across the Cardano blockchain without the use of a smart contract, so there are no fees generated by the transaction aside from the basic fee the network always charges.\nFinally, we have the entry on the actual blockchain or distributed ledger. The registration of this crypto token into the database of the distributed ledger allows everyone in the open-source blockchain network to view it. This registry will include a reference to the external piece of media, the information of the metadata, and the token ID of the individual NFT.\nThe act of minting is taking all of these separate parts and unifying them when the crypto token is registered to the blockchain. Once the NFT is created, all of these pieces come together and become the single crypto asset or NFT that others are able to buy.\nFor NFTs, whitelisting usually means that a crypto wallet address such as a Cardano-specific address is pre-approved for minting NFTs during a specified date or time (usually within a pre-determined time range).\nWhitelisting allows NFT projects to ensure users are able to get their NFTs and secure at least one for their specific wallet address.\nFor example, NFT projects may want to give a priority purchase window to wallets that have already purchased their previous collection. These wallets that hold previous NFTs might get whitelisted in return, and gain early, limited access to new future NFT collections.\nAdditionally, restrictions can be placed, such as limiting the number of NFTs a single crypto wallet can mint, to prevent just a few users from dominating the supply of a particular collection.\nWhitelisting is a powerful tool for creators and NFT projects. It allows them to more effectively promote, control distribution, create hype, and much more around an NFT drop or collection.\nFibo is a Cardano NFT marketplace empowering artists and collectors for a positive social impact.\nDeveloped by EMURGO, a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain, Fibo leverages Cardano s environmentally-sustainable and open-source blockchain technology to provide a complete one-stop NFT platform including Yoroi wallet integration, minting, buying, and selling Cardano NFTs.\nTo get started on Fibo, please download Yoroi Wallet Google Chrome Extension and send some Cardano ADA to your account.\nPlease also join our Fibo Discord using the link below to join our community.\nAbout Fibo\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "DeFi Basics Yield Farming EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 15, 2024\nEMURGO\nIn our DeFi Basics blog series focusing on decentralized finance, we look at the basic products and services within DeFi. In this blog, we will explain yield farming and its role in DeFi.\nYield farming was one of the major drivers of DeFi s explosive growth during 2020 and 2021. It is a type of tool that can potentially benefit both blockchain developers and DeFi users, as it creates an ecosystem where users are incentivized to participate in a particular DeFi platform.\nLet s look at yield farming more closely and describe how its properties have played a role as a powerful engine for DeFi growth and adoption.\nFirst, let us deconstruct a little of the connection starting with the word yield and what it means in this context.\nYield refers to the revenue generated by a financial instrument over a particular period. For example, government bonds generate yield for the duration of the debt. It can be less than a year for treasury bills, or more than a year in the case of bonds. The value of the bond is then multiplied by the percentage it pays and the duration to get the yield of the asset.\nMuch of this is true also in the blockchain or DeFi world, with the difference being that yield can be generated through a variety of ways. For example, users can generate yield by interest from lending platforms, dividends from security tokens, fees from liquidity pools, or rewards from delegating and staking cryptocurrencies. Crucially, these methods are not mutually exclusive, in fact combining them is common.\nNext, the term farming here refers to growing something.\nIt initially started as a joke among the DeFi community, who referred to the act of gaining yield from different sources as growing their fields as farmers. So, the term yield farming was coined as the phrase to encapsulate both ideas.\nLet s now get to the crux of the matter: What is yield farming?\nIt has two sides.\nFirst, from the perspective of DeFi users, it is a strategy where users look for the best yields among different DeFi projects to lock their tokens and gain rewards. Since an individual user only has a set number of tokens, looking for the best yields is crucial.\nFrom the perspective of a DeFi developer, yield farming is a mechanism to incentivize users to use a DeFi project by offering rewards in the form of yield.\nThe yield generated comes from two sources: one is the core activity of the platform, token pools, lending and borrowing, staking, etc.\nThe other portion of the yield comes in the form of rewards given in the platform s token. For example, a person who lends his tokens to a lending pool first gets rewards from the interest paid by the counterparty. Second, the platform gives additional rewards in the form of the platform s tokens for participating in the system. The DeFi user then has to calculate the value of the fees generated by the loans and the value of the token in the market to get the total reward amount.\nThe DeFi project s token can be a major component of the reward.\nA common way to start is with a simple example, which would be using a reputable decentralized exchange or DEX.\nYield farming can be a potentially powerful tool to grow a DeFi project and generate passive income for users. This dual property makes it one of the most innovative mechanisms created by the DeFi industry.\nHowever, DeFi does carry many risks as it is decentralized and there is no legal mechanism to cover or safeguard user funds in case of hacks or security breaches. Users are expected to assume the risks of their actions.\nClick here to sign up\nAre you interested in learning more about DeFi?\nThen, EMURGO s DeFi workshop specifically geared for business professionals is right for you.\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are scheduled to host a 2-day workshop on DeFi in early 2024 with speakers from EMURGO, EMURGO Academy, and other DeFi projects.\nThe workshop will provide you with a deeper understanding of DeFi, enabling you to prepare for DeFi s evolution, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and also contribute to the growth of DeFi.\nFor more workshop information including dates and registration info, please visit the official registration page here.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Cardano NFT Case Study NMKR and Book.io EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "September 26, 2024\nEMURGO\nThe book publishing industry has evolved significantly since the 1990s, yet many traditional practices still limit the rewards authors can reap from their work.\nBook.io is building the future of book ownership. It is at the forefront of changing this by leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionize how books are published and distributed thereby changing the game for its authors and owners.\nAs one of the pioneering NFT projects on the Cardano network, Book.io has demonstrated the power and potential of decentralized publishing.\nNotably, they were among the earliest adopters of NMKR s NFT minting platform, showcasing a new frontier for digital assets in the literary world.\nLet s discuss how this partnership has brought unique value to book authors and owners.\nBook.io is an NFT project using the Cardano blockchain network to decentralize books and knowledge. It achieves this by enabling books to never deteriorate while at the same time being able to be sold or transferred across the globe in seconds without permission.\nAccording to its website:\nIn 2017, Cofounders Joshua Stone and Ben Illian were brainstorming about the future of digital books and media. Then, Josh asked a question that would chase them until the launch of Book.io on July 22, 2022: What if we truly owned our digital books? What if we owned our eBooks and Audiobooks like we owned our physical books? At the time, it was just a question, but one they returned to often. By 2021, it became a daily discussion that turned into an obsession. This was a problem that needed to be fixed.\nIn the current digital book distribution model, an e-book is not owned by the person who buys it. The platform is the owner of the media and it extends a license to the final user. It means that those who purchase an e-book do not completely own the book, but rather have access to read it as they wish. As it stands, there are several middlemen involved in the process from book authorship to viewership.\nRelated reading:\nBook.io uses the power of the distributed ledger to change this dynamic. It gives authors control over their creations and also empowers buyers to truly own their e-book purchases and be able to sell them to others. There is much more of a direct link between authors and readers with fewer middlemen involved.\nTo do this, Book.io publishes digital books as NFTs using the NMKR platform. Not only is the cover of the book represented as an NFT, but the whole e-book is part of the token.\nAs a result, e-book owners can freely use their NFTs. After they are done reading the book, the NFT can be resold on the open market. In some cases, the price can be higher than the original one.\nBy using NFTs, authors can maintain full ownership of their work before any sale.\nThis contrasts with traditional distribution models where digital publishers often control key aspects such as the timing of the book s release, its visibility, and even pricing. This leaves authors with limited control over their creations.\nHowever, with Book.io s model, authors can retain the majority of the sale proceeds and have the autonomy to set their own retail prices, giving them far greater control over their work s distribution and value.\nThis also opens up new potential strategies for those aspiring to be writers.\nTraditionally, used book sales have been a point of contention between publishers and authors, as these sales don t typically generate royalties for the writers. As a result, many authors have been hesitant to engage with the used book market.\nWith Book.io s model, however, authors can earn royalties even on secondary sales, bridging the gap between primary sales and the used book market, and providing authors with ongoing revenue streams from their work.\nAuthors can utilize innovative strategies to promote their books through Book.io. For instance, they can create special edition covers as rare NFTs, which can be sold at a higher price. These unique editions can not only attract more interest in secondary markets but also result in potentially higher royalties for the author, providing an additional revenue stream and increasing the value of their work.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service built on the Cardano blockchain. In their quest to tokenize and sell e-books, Book partnered with NMKR to use its API and harness the power of the Cardano blockchain.\nTo date, Book.io has successfully sold hundreds of thousands of NFTs and released more than 70 titles, showcasing its ability to revolutionize the digital book industry, create true ownership for readers, and a new distribution model for authors.\nThe tokens are not public NFT images of book covers but are fully Decentralized Encrypted Assets (DEAs). This means the token itself is the entire book, fully decentralized and living on-chain in the Cardano network.\nAre you interested in asset tokenization and NFT usage on Cardano using NMKR?

Thus, its ecosystem needs to have internal engines of growth that can sustain and expand the number of products & services leveraging its technology.\nThis is where NMKR, an NFT and tokenization service using the Cardano blockchain, and their Launchpad service can play an important role in helping to drive ecosystem expansion.\nLet s discuss further below.\nNMKR is one of the biggest NFT creation services on Cardano. Since launching in 2021, it has allowed companies and creators to mint NFTs of desired items such as diamonds, e-books, and more. By issuing NFTs of physical and digital items, they can be freely traded on a global scale, re-sold at a later date, prove item authenticity, and provide greater item transparency to users, among other benefits.\nIts selling point lies in its ability to remove the high technical barrier to blockchain and NFTs as their core services do not require any coding. NMKR offers a complete set of technical tools including NMKR Studio that allow anyone or any business to mint NFTs, launch collections, customize token metadata, and sell NFTs with no blockchain background required.\nRelated reading:\nTo date, more than two million NFTs have been minted using the NMKR platform, and are consistently found among the top 10 most used dApps in the ecosystem.\nMoving forward, the NMKR Studio tool is continuing to evolve and will be expanded into a full launchpad.\nUser expansion is needed to sustain and grow any dApp and its blockchain ecosystem.\nOver time, a blockchain network requires more active users to collect transaction fees, increase traffic and trading volume, and more.\nIt s part of a feedback loop where bigger and better dApps drive user growth which in turn, drives blockchain network fees and usage, encouraging more developers to build on that blockchain.\nWhile most of the growth in NFTs and blockchain to a greater degree thus far, has been driven by individual users, onboarding businesses can exponentially grow an ecosystem moving forward.\nYet, businesses interested in the NFT space still need to overcome significant barriers due to the complex technical requirements and strategic nuances of launching successful NFT services.\nTo help them, NMKR is enhancing its Studio platform with a dedicated Business Onboarding Program and a robust NFT Launchpad:\nThe expanded NMKR Studio will become a one-stop shop for the entire NFT development cycle, enabling businesses to quickly ideate and launch NFT collections from a single interface without specialized knowledge.\nNMKR s Launchpad aims to become a new growth engine for Cardano by creating a usable platform that can bridge the gap between NFT technology and business needs.\nIf adopted, more NFT projects utilizing the Launchpad could bring more fees to the Cardano network and grow its treasury. Also, the increased transaction volume will expand the overall use of the network.\nOnce brands adopt and successfully launch popular NFT collections via the NMKR Launchpad, this could have a virtuous network effect and bring new users to explore the Launchpad and other related Cardano dApps such as NFT marketplaces, and lending services.\nAs a result, Cardano at the network and the dApp levels can significantly benefit from the adoption of growth engines such as NMKR s platform.\nFollow EMURGO s X and LinkedIn to receive the latest blogs and blockchain-related content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "NFTs in DAOs Uses and Benefits EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "October 17, 2024\nEMURGO\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) are expanding their footprint across various sectors of the blockchain industry. Originally seen as a means of distributing media such as images, NFTs have expanded their use cases to boost the potential for mainstream Web3 adoption further.\nA prime example of these evolving NFT use cases is how decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are starting to leverage NFTs to manage their operations.\nAs digital entities native to a decentralized blockchain, DAOs are at the forefront of adopting NFTs for various administrative functions.\nIn this blog, we ll explore how DAOs are utilizing NFTs to streamline and enhance their management processes.\nA DAO is a native entity within the blockchain or Web3 ecosystem. It operates as a type of digital organization where decisions are made through group consensus and executed on-chain, meaning its processes and records are immutably and transparently documented on a decentralized blockchain network.\nDAOs are typically global and accessible, with members from around the world collaborating on various related projects for their sustainability and development.\nIn Japan, companies are now able to start establishing DAOs to raise capital in the form of NFTs and to conduct business operations on-chain, thereby providing more transparency and accountability as well as efficiency in the digital age.\nHowever, DAOs also face challenges in identifying members, allocating resources, providing rewards, and verifying individual contributions, among others.\nThis is where NFTs come into play, offering unique solutions for DAOs to these challenges through their technological properties.\nRead more: EMURGO s support for DAO adoption in Japan\nAn NFT is a digital token issued on a decentralized blockchain such as Cardano. Within the NFT can be relevant data and information in its token metadata. The NFT can represent a variety of different assets with each NFT being unique.\nHere s a list of five ways DAOs use NFTs for their administrative processes.\nFirst, NFTs are often used as a type of membership badge in DAOs. Since DAOs operate globally and are part of the blockchain ecosystem, members can sometimes remain anonymous, making it challenging to distinguish genuine members from those who might attempt to deceive others.\nThis is where NFTs provide an ideal solution by offering a way to verify and identify DAO members. DAOs issue NFTs to their members, granting them specific responsibilities and the authority to represent the organization. This approach helps to separate legitimate members from other users and ensures a more secure and trustworthy environment for the members collaborating within a DAO.\nNFTs can also represent tiers or levels of advancement within a DAO. As a member progresses within the organization, they may take on additional duties and gain access to more resources.\nUsing updatable or dynamic NFTs such as Cardano-based NFTs allows for modifications in an NFT that reflect a member s increased access and responsibilities. As members advance within the DAO s structure, their membership NFT can be updated to include new details and privileges.\nThis approach provides a decentralized yet objective method of recognizing responsibility. Additionally, if a member decides to take a break or leave the organization, their NFT can be frozen or removed from circulation to accurately reflect their new status.\nParticipation is central to the success and sustainability of a DAO. For a DAO to thrive, its members must be active in completing new projects and growing existing initiatives.\nBut how can a DAO measure participation and member activity?\nThis is a challenge that organizations of all types and sizes face.\nIn the Web3 world, proof-of-attendance offers a solution. This concept involves issuing NFTs to members who attend meetings, participate in projects, contribute to tasks, or attend conferences. These NFTs serve as badges that can be collected to demonstrate a member s commitment to the DAO.\nThe more badges a member accumulates, the easier it becomes to recognize them as someone who is actively contributing and potentially ready to move up in the ranks.\nThese can be stored and sent to wallets such as Yoroi that support NFTs.\nBuilding on the previous example, NFTs can also be linked to rewards. For instance, a member who attends a conference organized by the DAO might receive a Proof-of-Attendance NFT, which is accompanied by a token reward.\nThis approach allows other members to verify that the reward was earned through participation in a specific activity, ensuring transparency and fairness. NFTs can thus be used not only to distribute tokens but also to serve as records documenting the reason behind each reward.\nAs with the case of private Japanese companies due to their new regulatory framework, those setting up DAOs in the country have the potential to use NFTs to raise capital through crowdfunding.\nThis presents an innovative approach to fundraising as long as local regulations are followed and clearly outlined, offering businesses the opportunity to tap into a global audience and explore new markets. Rather than just a digital collectible, the NFT could also potentially uniquely represent a stake in a business along with voting rights and other privileges.\nThe global nature of NFTs makes them particularly attractive for fundraising, especially in industries where traditional financing has become difficult due to environmental or social concerns. NFTs enable businesses to introduce their brand, access a global investor base, and enhance their credibility by showcasing their willingness to embrace innovative fundraising methods.\nAdditionally, NFTs can improve liquidity by being traded on secondary markets, making them appealing to investors who seek exit options.\nFor businesses considering NFT fundraising, it is crucial to ensure the NFTs have long-term value, are integrated into a larger ecosystem, and comply with local regulations, ultimately providing a novel way to raise capital and engage with a global community of investors.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain. Its platform and tools enable businesses and individuals to tokenize assets and mint NFTs without any coding knowledge.\nIt has also been granted preliminary approval by the Japan DAO Association as a legitimate DAO tool for Japanese companies looking to set up DAOs along with Yoroi Wallet and Clarity for things such as a membership NFT.\nRead more: How NMKR adds value to brands\nWant to learn more about NFTs and their use cases beyond just images?

    "input": "",
    "output": "November 21, 2024\nEMURGO\nIn the previous Part 1 blog, we discussed the first steps to creating a Cardano NFT using the NMKR platform.\nNMKR is an NFT and tokenization service built on the Cardano blockchain. It enables businesses and individuals to issue NFTs by uploading images and other content to its platform and does not require any coding knowledge. By integrating with other essential tools such as Cardano wallets, NFTs created on NMKR can be stored, transferred, and transacted using these wallets.\nIn this Part 2 blog, let s go over the other options that a user has once their NFT has been minted.\nFollowing the previous steps outlined in Part 1, the menu below shall appear in the Projects section of NMKR Studio:\nThis is a summary of the NFT designed in the previous blog.\nFrom here, the format of the NFT can be changed in the future. Also, from this menu, a user can access the sale option in NMKR Studio by clicking on Manage Project for those interested in putting it up for sale.\nThe first choice Cardano Collection Token in the dropdown menu allows a user to create a royalty token. This will ensure that a percentage of every NFT resale goes to the wallet specified by the token s creator.\nThe Identity Token tab that is displayed once the above is clicked refers to a different utility tied to DAOs, which we won t explore for this guide.\nThe second dropdown menu item Set NFT Prices is where a user can settle on the price of each minted NFT in their collection. Once we click on it, a user will see the following menu:\nIt ll show the basic configuration of the sale plus the breakdown of the fees. We can see that the NFT is priced at 100 ADA per unit. Using that figure as an example, zooming into the breakdown shows the following details:\nFirst, is the carry ADA or deposit that is taken from a buyer s wallet and given back along with the purchased NFT. This is one of Cardano s parameters that cannot be changed by an application.\nNext, there are NMKR fees. It states above that it is a fixed three percent minimum charged by the platform.\nThe transaction fees are the commission charged by the Cardano network itself. This is also a fixed network parameter that cannot be changed by the user.\nFinally, there is the net amount that will go to the NFT creator. If the creator chooses, they can split the payment into several wallet addresses. In this example, all the ADA goes to one wallet.\nTo change the price and edit the receiver s wallet, a user can choose the Edit button which will open the following menu:\nHere, a user can set up how many NFTs are in the collection, the price for each token, plus the currency desired for the transactions. Options include ADA and other traditional options. Finally, a user can also set up a time interval for these prices.\nBelow is the NMKR Pay menu. It allows users to customize the payment gateway plus the style of the Buy button.\nRead more about NMKR Pay.\nThe first option allows for:\nMulti-Sig Payments are comprehensive transactions in which the payment, minting, distribution, and eventual discounts are all handled in a single transaction. This reduces blockchain congestion significantly because refunds for incorrect or late received transactions are no longer necessary, and the number of transactions is reduced from two to one. Because of the fewer transactions, the MultiSig method is at least twice as fast as the regular method.\nThe second option allows for:\nDefine NMKR Pay Sale Start which allows the creator to set up a time interval for NMKR Pay to be active.\nAll these choices modify the API. Once the configuration is finished, the same API can be used to port the changes to the NFT sales platform.\nThe next feature NMKR Studio allows is for the user to create discount conditions. Users can set up a series of discounts based on some criteria met by the buyers.\nIn the above example, a user can create a list of whitelisted wallet addresses that have access and provide a 5 discount to each. Clicking on Edit displays the other choices:\nThe next set of menus allows users to create sale conditions for the NFTs themselves:\nNMKR Studio is a comprehensive platform to mint and create sales for NFTs. As we have shown, it provides all the necessary tools to create NFT collections. There is a complete list of sale conditions that ensure NFT creators can customize their creations to suit their specific needs.\nNMKR Pay provides payment gateways that also expand the possibilities for NFT creators. With NMKR, creators can avoid using smart contracts and launch NFTs by selecting options from the intuitive menus we ve shown.

    "instruction": "NFT Insights Tokenization of Physical Collectibles EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "April 10, 2024\nEMURGO\nThere is an enormous market for luxury collectibles which is expanding. It s estimated the global collectibles market is worth $372 billion and is poised to reach $522 billion by 2028. This has created an increasing demand for these assets by many collectors.\nIn some cases, collectors don t buy these items because they are interested in the specific object. Rather, they purchase them expecting a return in the future.\nHowever, this can be a complicated proposition, as the market for these luxury goods tends to be restricted to certain geographical markets and significantly reliant on private, personal transactions. This results in sellers facing potential difficulties in finding interested buyers close to where they are located and buyers unable to find sellers.\nThis presents another potential real use case for asset tokenization, where NFTs and blockchain technology can offer a viable solution to buyers and sellers of luxury collectibles.\nLuxury collectibles are a category that covers many types of items like handbags, sneakers, watches, toys, jewelry, and other things. This range of diversity makes it a challenge to represent them under a single asset type.\nNon-fungible tokens or NFTs present a real solution to this challenge. Each item can be represented as an NFT and relevant collectible information can be recorded in the metadata of the NFT. Each record ensures the item is unique or part of a larger collection.\nRelated reading:\nOne example is BearBrick, a series of collectibles. Each BearBrick is part of a collection that has limited units. Some collections are rarer than others, and there are also unique statues that are more expensive.\nThese collectibles have been tokenized from time to time. The company also created an NFT series, although the NFT is just an addition to the collectible, not a claim of ownership over the actual object.\nAnother example of tokenized luxury goods can be found in the sneakers market.\nRecently, Adidas sold a collection of tokenized sneakers and managed to raise $22 million. This is a clear example of a major sporting brand adopting NFT technology and tokenization, which is attracting the attention of other big sporting brands.\nTokenization of physical objects requires an additional layer. This means having a third party hold or custody the items securely while the NFTs are used to trade the ownership of the collectible item.\nOnce a buyer wants to have ownership of the collectible, they can request the custodian to release the item to them. This would burn the NFT and remove it from the blockchain ledger, so it cannot be traded anymore.\nAll of this essential information including transaction history and manufacturer information would be included in the NFT metadata, transparent to potential buyers.\nCurrently, the market for collectibles has many issues. However, blockchain technology can now solve many of these issues. The advantages of tokenized collectibles are unique:\nFraud prevention: forgeries plague the collectibles market. For example, it s estimated that a certain percentage of luxury watches are fake. Tokenization can combat this by recording the characteristics of each item in NFT metadata.\nGeo-locked markets: physical goods are tied to their local markets. A collectible can be valuable, but if there are no buyers near the seller, then the value is immaterial. Tokenization can open up the collectibles markets, by allowing a global pool of buyers for NFTs of collectible assets.\nLow liquidity: collectibles also suffer from low liquidity. This can be overturned by having the global market of the blockchain integrated with the sale of any collectible.\nUntapped potential: collectibles are sometimes used as collateral to borrow money. However, there are cases where a shop takes advantage of the user and gives them a lowball offer amount for the item. In blockchain, NFTs can be used as collateral for loans and can be much fairer and more numerous than traditional methods.\nOne prime example of a real use case for asset tokenization is NMKR, an NFT and tokenization service leveraging the Cardano blockchain.\nIt has demonstrated a use case through its partnership with Tiamonds, which focuses on the tokenization of diamonds using NFTs. These can be traded over the Cardano blockchain while the actual diamond is locked and secured with a third-party custodian.\nAt any point, a holder of one of the Tiamonds NFTs can redeem the token for the actual physical diamond. At this point, the NFT representing that diamond is burned and removed from the supply. NMKR helped Tiamonds tokenize diamonds and sell them over the Cardano network.\nRead more: How NMKR tokenized diamonds with Tiamonds\nThis was a specific instance of tokenization by NMKR, as they worked directly with the other project to craft the NFTs representing the diamonds.\nNMKR plans to expand this model with more tools and features and launch a broader tokenization platform to enable more businesses to create tokens of real-world assets using NFTs.\nInterested in learning more about real-world asset (RWA) tokenization using blockchain technology?\nThen, follow EMURGO on X to receive future notifications about blogs and content.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "February 18, 2021\nTogether Agency\nEMURGO a global blockchain technology company providing custom-built solutions to solve the most complex problems of enterprises and governments, and a founding entity of the Cardano protocol is proud to work with our Cardano ecosystem partners in welcoming the Mary hard fork as a step towards smart contracts with Goguen.\nMary, a hard fork scheduled to transition the Cardano blockchain protocol from the Shelley decentralization era closer to the Goguen smart contract era, was successfully deployed on February 3, 2021 as a Testnet. The much-awaited update brings native assets to the Cardano test network and allows developers the ability to create custom tokens or migrate existing projects to Cardano. Mary is expected to fully launch on the Cardano Mainnet shortly.\nThe Mary hard fork is a significant update that opens a world of possibilities to developers and businesses looking to build on or migrate to Cardano. By allowing for the creation of tokens on the Cardano blockchain, Cardano s decentralized blockchain will be transformed into a multi-asset blockchain. This will unleash the full promise of Cardano for a wide range of services and solutions such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), stablecoins, and others, and paves the way for a burgeoning decentralized crypto economy.\nUser-defined tokens in Cardano are native to the Cardano protocol. Native tokens are not treated any differently to ADA by the Cardano network. Effectively, project tokens launched on Cardano do not need smart contracts built on top of its blockchain to be issued. The logic behind the way these are created and exchanged is already part of the blockchain. This design reduces the possibility of human error.\nCardano s native tokens and user-defined tokens share almost all of ADA s properties without the need to create custom logic on top of its blockchain. Additionally, ADA and tokens on Cardano will be fully exchangeable from Day 1, greatly simplifying decentralized exchanges (DEX) and DeFi applications.\nSimplicity is the main advantage of native tokens. Their introduction brings a meaningful improvement to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. DeFi and DApp developers can now use tools designed to work in tandem from the ground up.\nRight now, the DeFi and DApp ecosystems are being held back by high transaction fees and unsecured smart contracts. As we discussed, native tokens address the second problem by having their core logic be part of the ledger itself. Cardano was designed to be of low cost, and that will not change with tokens launched on the network.\nThe Mary hard fork and the Goguen era s upcoming full deployment will bring more third-party developers to Cardano, helping to increase its overall network effects. This migration to the network will generate increased self-sustaining demand for Cardano s ADA.\nADA will be fully tradable with native tokens from the start, unlocking the power and huge interest worldwide in DeFi applications. In Cardano, transactions between native tokens do not generate high fees, making DeFi applications even more affordable.\nThe Mary hard fork is another monumental step towards the full maturation of Cardano s blockchain network from inception to full decentralization to staking to native assets thus far.\nThis will be the first step to onboarding more exciting and useful projects, companies and enterprises, helping to develop a flourishing Cardano ecosystem with decentralized services and solutions.\nAs always, please stay up to date with the latest developments at EMURGO and the Cardano ecosystem by following us on Twitter @emurgo_io and feel free to contact us at info@emurgo.io about how we can assist you with building your services on Cardano.\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "Becoming a Blockchain Security Engineer EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "October 17, 2023\nEMURGO\nOverseeing blockchain security is another crucial part of blockchain development that is handled by blockchain security engineers and developers. After dApp developers have finished creating a product, the dApp product must go through an auditing process to check the dApp s code for potential bugs and security flaws. This audit makes the dApp safer and more trustworthy for the general public to use upon release.\nThe engineers who do these security audits are some of the most specialized in the blockchain industry. As such, some of the highest paying jobs for a blockchain developer are as an auditing specialist or blockchain security engineer.\nIn this blog as part of our Cardano blockchain developer roadmap series, we ll go over why blockchain audits are needed and also how one becomes a blockchain security engineer. With demand for such roles having quickly grown in recent years, many opportunities have arisen for potential blockchain security engineers and developers specializing in smart contract audits.\nFocusing on the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, a dApp built leveraging Cardano is public since the entire Cardano blockchain itself is also open-source and public. This means it can be accessed all year round, which also means it can also be attacked just as often. This has been a reality for most Web3 products such as DeFi and NFTs that utilize smart contracts on public, decentralized blockchains.\nAccording to DeFiLlama, over seven billion dollars have been lost to hacks and exploits in the blockchain industry. This staggering figure serves as a reminder that blockchain networks need to be designed as critical infrastructure. This means projects and their developers need to prioritize security to create a safe experience for their users.\nCardano as an open-source decentralized blockchain built with a research-first approach, has emphasized security since the beginning. Much of the reason to use Haskell as its programming language over other computer languages was due to the security properties inherent to functional programming.\nAs with dApps on other public blockchains, security should be a foremost priority for any dApp built on Cardano. To achieve this, audits play a major role by identifying potential security vulnerabilities ahead of time to prevent the loss of user funds.\nA blockchain security audit can largely follow two approaches to verification:\nManual Verification\nIn manual verification audits, human auditors review the smart contract s code and documentation to identify potential vulnerabilities or issues.\nThey rely on their expertise, best practices, and coding standards to evaluate the contract s security. These audits rely heavily on human auditors and their judgment. While tools like static analysis may be used, the process is not entirely automated.\nThe focus is primarily on known security vulnerabilities, coding best practices, and issues that may arise during contract execution. The scope can be broader but may not cover all possible scenarios. While manual audits can uncover many issues, they cannot guarantee the absence of all vulnerabilities. The results are based on the auditor s expertise and may be subjective to some extent. However, manual audit reviews are a very effective approach to ensuring security guarantees for the smart contract being audited.\nFormal Verification\nFormal verification is a process where the attributes of a piece of code are mathematically proven to have certain possible results. It takes a detailed specification of the logic behind the code and identifies security vulnerabilities and incorrect and inefficient coding.\nThis method aims to ensure that the contract adheres to its specifications under all possible conditions within the specified constraints, and is free from certain types of bugs and vulnerabilities.\nFormal verification relies on automated tools and mathematical proofs to verify the contract s correctness. This approach can offer a higher degree of assurance in terms of contract behavior. It offers a more rigorous and objective assessment. Finally, it determines ways to resolve the problems.\nThese audits are very complex and take a deep knowledge of not only a computer language but also the compilation process. To verify the logic of a piece of code, security auditors use a special type of computer language.\nOne example of this is Isabelle, a higher-order logic (HOL) theorem prover, written in standard Scala. It s meant to take the logic of a smart contract and create formal methods that prove a certain piece of code can have many possible outcomes.\nThis is then used to see which of the possible outcomes can have detrimental results. The idea is to eliminate or minimize the possibility of a smart contract ending in an outcome not desired by the developers.\nThe Haskell language, since it is based on functional programming, lends itself well to these types of proofs. That s why there is a good pairing of Isabelle and Haskell when it comes to audits for Cardano dApps and the Cardano network.\nThe path to a blockchain security engineer or expert is longer and more demanding than any of the previous roles discussed (see on-chain Cardano developer; off-chain Cardano developer; Cardano frontend developer).\nMany blockchain security auditors began their careers as blockchain developers. It is important to first have a background in building dApps before jumping to analyzing their vulnerabilities.\nThe entry point can be any part of blockchain development from validators (on-chain), to off-chain code, backend, or even frontend development for Cardano. The main part is to be familiar with how dApps are designed and how they are brought into production. The auditor has to have developed a strong understanding of unit testing, property-based testing, and using tools like static security analysis tools where applicable during this process. They should also have a good understanding of production design patterns to achieve a clean, efficient design.\nAnother key aspect is understanding formal mathematical methods. The entire process of an audit is to take the logic from a piece of code and translate it into a formal language. The result is then analyzed for potential unforeseen outputs from the logic.\nThere is a lot of formal logic and mathematics that is required to finish the audit. It s important to know that to enter this field a developer needs to understand these principles. People aiming to become security auditors should start learning about these systems even before they attempt to make a career change.\nEMURGO Academy is the education unit of Cardano blockchain founding entity EMURGO and has created a complete, tailored program for students to become specialized Cardano blockchain developers. The program has extensive coverage on unit testing, property-based testing, and security best practices and also has an introduction to Isabelle where participants are exposed to the the basic principles of a security audit.\nThe introduction is meant to be a basic exposition of the concepts and application of security audits, not a complete program to become a security auditor. But by showing participants what are the possible uses and how the security industry is evolving, this experience can be used as a stepping stone to becoming a blockchain security engineer.\nEnroll now with EMURGO Academy and embark on your journey to working in Cardano and Web3 as a blockchain security expert.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "How to Become an OnChain Cardano Blockchain Developer EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "September 18, 2023\nEMURGO\nThis blog explains what you need to become an on-chain Cardano blockchain developer.\nInterest in the Cardano blockchain and crypto overall has grown immensely over the past several years as many people all over the world have started to adopt and use blockchain-based applications as well as crypto. In Cardano, many decentralized applications (dApps) for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs have gained much traction with users.\nAs more developers gain interest in developing decentralized products and services on Cardano due to its fast transactions, reasonable fees, and environmentally friendly tech, a diverse range of these dApps is poised to make Cardano one of the most used blockchains in the industry. According to research by blockchain analytics firm Santiment, Cardano developer activity has consistently increased while more Cardano dApps have continuously deployed to the main network.\nThe combination of development activity and user demand for Cardano dApps is turbocharging the demand for Cardano blockchain developers. As the ecosystem keeps expanding, more and more projects compete for a finite pool of qualified blockchain developer professionals, especially in the Cardano ecosystem.\nThis naturally creates a significant opportunity for others to join and meet the demand. There is a vast need for new qualified Cardano developers and that gap is creating significant opportunities with lucrative benefits for some.\nHowever, the market needs time to catch up when procuring and training new blockchain developers. It takes time to learn, apply, and develop the practical skills needed to build on Cardano. There is also a misconception when it comes to Cardano development as it s very different from growth in other blockchain ecosystems.\nIn this blog series focusing on becoming a Cardano developer, find out what you need to know to develop on Cardano, the unique properties of developing in Cardano, and various related topics including the differences between Haskell, Plutus, Marlowe, and more.\nCardano is different from other blockchain networks. In most other blockchains, a smart contract is a single entity that governs the logic of token sales, distribution, balance tracking, etc. Instead, the Cardano ecosystem has native tokens, which means the token balance is recorded directly in the Cardano blockchain ledger.\nFor this reason, a blockchain developer for Cardano dApps is a much more specialized role in Cardano. The dApp is divided into distinct portions which require different skills to develop. Broadly speaking there are three categories:\nThese are the three major fields that relate to what a blockchain developer does on Cardano. Each is a specialized track and developers will benefit the most by focusing on one area. It s still important to be aware of the other sections, but in Cardano, specialization is key.\nIn the rest of this article, we ll focus on the on-chain portion of a dApp which is the most traditional and common role for a blockchain developer\nAs we have said, a validator is a piece of code that lives on the Cardano network which is why it is called on-chain code. It s the portion of the dApp that is deployed to the blockchain and what gets executed by the nodes on Cardano. It s what most traditionally could be understood as a smart contract.\nYet, on Cardano, creating fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) doesn t require a smart contract. So, the validator is a more specialized tool that is used to govern the logic to manipulate tokens.\nA validator can create tokens on demand, lock them in an escrow, use them as collateral for a loan, etc. It s a tool that can be used to code the different roles and actions a user can perform when interacting with a given dApp.\nThe on-chain code is coded by a blockchain developer who understands the architecture of Cardano. It requires a deep knowledge of how Cardano executes these instructions and how the node architecture interacts with other portions of the dApps.\nIn and of itself, the on-chain code is small. A validator can have a few hundred lines of a couple thousand at most. This doesn t mean it is an easy role, as it requires much thought and design to abstract the logic of a use case into the lines of code that the network will execute.\nIt s a role best suited for those looking to take complex interactions and create a finite set of instructions for them. Of course, an on-chain developer also needs to be in constant communication with the other members of the team to streamline the process.\nThe path toward becoming a Cardano blockchain developer on the validator track runs through the design of Cardano. It requires the following:\nAll these different sections are what make up an on-chain or validator Cardano developer. Each has an important role when developing in Cardano and they make up most of the tools an on-chain developer will use during dApp creation.\nEMURGO Academy, the education unit of Cardano founding entity EMURGO, has created various online learning programs geared towards learning how to build on Cardano.\nIn its courses, EMURGO Academy introduces Haskell in a comprehensive manner that leads to the creation of on-chain code. It also teaches the architecture and design of Cardano, and how to use the Cardano node and CLI as tools, among others.\nIt is a complete primer for those looking to break into the Cardano ecosystem as a developer. The information needed to become a Cardano blockchain developer is aggregated into a single platform that guides a person through all the portions of dApp development with hands-on teaching and live Q&A sessions.\nThe programs are all designed around Cardano, so all the particulates of the network are explored. As such, it s the best way to quickly learn Cardano-related skills and to fast-track your blockchain developer career.\nTo register and learn more, visit EMURGO Academy s site here.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "Becoming an OffChain Cardano Blockchain Developer EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "October 5, 2023\nEMURGO\nIn the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, one can become an on-chain Cardano blockchain developer, and one can also become an off-chain developer.\nIn our previous blog in the Cardano blockchain developer roadmap series, we discussed how becoming a Cardano developer is focused on role specialization which differs from blockchain developers in other blockchains. Thus, understanding the different requirements can be helpful for interested Cardano blockchain developers to start their blockchain careers.\nAs we look at different Cardano developer roles and their specializations, in this blog we will discuss off-chain Cardano blockchain development more closely and the importance of transaction construction to dApp development on Cardano.\nIt s a specialization field found mostly for Cardano blockchain dApps.\nIn most traditional blockchain development, a smart contract is used to define the attributes of a token (supply, name, decimals, etc.). Inside, the code also configures the behavior of transactions. This means a traditional smart contract contains both the characteristics of an asset plus the rules of how it can be transferred. Additionally, the blockchain ledger is not aware of the balance of the tokens and each smart contract has to track this information.\nHowever, Cardano has taken a different approach.\nIn Cardano, assets are native to the blockchain ledger, which means there is no need to deploy a smart contract to create a new token. The Cardano ledger takes charge of the traditional functions such as transferring a token and tracking balances.\nWhich begs the next question:\nHow do Cardano blockchain developers control more complex operations?\nIn many cases, businesses will want more complex logic applied to a group of assets such as locking, staking, minting on-demand, and much more.\nThis is the role of the off-chain code developer.\nIt s the person in charge of setting a set of steps for a type of complex logic.\nIn our first article, we discussed the on-chain code or validator which is important for Cardano on-chain developers. It is a piece of logic that lives in the blockchain and governs the behavior of an asset. The validator alone cannot do it, as it needs a set of instructions that connect with it to give the desired outputs.\nThese instructions are called off-chain code or transaction construction.\nTheir main job is to connect to the validator, execute the logic contained there, and distribute the outputs to the receiving addresses. Additionally, it is used to:\nThis code is called off-chain because it does not get uploaded to the Cardano network. It has to be set separately in a server that can service requests of users interacting with the dApp. By separating the role of the asset logic and transaction construction, Cardano reduces the attack surface of a dApp.\nThe first step is to understand that there are two main sets of tools for transaction construction. First, the Cardano Command Line Interface (CLI) and second, the Plutus Application Backend (PAB). Both are meant to help with the off-chain code.\nThe Cardano CLI is installed along the node and it works on a shell terminal. It s a hierarchy of commands and subcommands that fulfill a wide set of roles. It can be used to generate wallet addresses, mint tokens, append metadata, and for transaction construction.\nThe shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands related to the Cardano CLI. In this field, shell-wrapping sets of commands can quickly serve to automate certain operations. It s possible to launch a dApp and have the entire logic of it governed just by the commands found on the CLI.\nThe Cardano CLI is made by commands preset by the core developers. It s suited to use cases that are relatively simple and don t require complex operations. In other cases where the business logic requires a custom solution, the Plutus Application Backend is used.\nRead more: Becoming an on-chain Cardano developer\nThe PAB is an off-chain framework that allows a developer to set up all the different necessities of the off-chain code. The original PAB was created by IOG, but since then alternatives have been also launched.\nThe original PAB used Haskell as the language and that makes it very compatible with the architecture of Cardano. Yet, other teams have launched alternatives that don t require a deep knowledge of Haskell and use more widely used computer languages such as:\nMesh\nMesh is an off-chain platform that uses languages popular with web developers such as Javascript or Typescript. It s able to interact with validators written in Plutus, the native language of Cardano, and help with all the roles of off-chain code.\nIt s also a very friendly platform filled with useful examples and extensive documentation. At the moment, it s perhaps the best entry point for those developers looking to enter the off-chain field.\nAtlas\nAtlas is an open-source PAB alternative that also focuses on Haskell. It s a versatile set of tools that can simplify Haskell coding while optimizing off-chain code when it comes to the eUTXO transaction used by Cardano.\nIt is the best option for those looking to keep their entire dApp using Haskell and not splitting the code between on-chain and off-chain. The platform is also modular allowing for it to be compatible with other development tools in the ecosystem.\nLucid\nLucid is another off-chain system developed for Javascript users. It is geared towards those programmers familiar with web development set up with a familiar interface. The team behind the project are members of the Cardano community and have created many applications found in the ecosystem.\nPyCardano\nPyCardano is a Cardano client written in Python. The library can create, balance, and sign transactions. The project aims to onboard Python developers to the ecosystem by bringing all the familiar tools from the Python world.\nEMURGO Academy is the education arm of Cardano founding entity EMURGO and has set up a collection of tailored online learning programs to fast-track the career of prospective Cardano blockchain developers.\nWith its expert knowledge and connections to the Cardano ecosystem, EMURGO Academy offers hands-on learning modules as well as live Q&A sessions to enable practical skill development in building Cardano dApps.\nTo learn more and enroll in the right course for you, visit EMURGO Academy s site here.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "output": "August 2, 2022\nAlbert Kim\nProject Catalyst is a decentralized funding platform for the Cardano blockchain.\nIt s an extension of the Cardano treasury and a testing ground for Cardano community governance as funding proposals are voted on by registered community members.\nTo date, it has run nine Project Catalyst Fund rounds and is gearing up for Fund10.\nThrough nine fund rounds, the Cardano community has cast 1.74 million community votes; voted on more than 4,770 proposals; approved more than 1,265 proposals, and allocated $64 million in total funding (*including ADA conversion from Fund10 onwards). [1]\nYou can sign up to view proposals and submit Project Catalyst proposals at the Cardano Ideascale here.\nThe funds to finance each of the rounds come from the Cardano treasury.\nStarting in Project Catalyst Fund 10, all proposals will have to request their budgets in ADA and have to take into account any possible price volatility when they do it. In the long run, this is a necessary step to ensure the growth of the overall Cardano ecosystem.\nThere are several community roles in Cardano Project Catalyst:\nProposer: The individuals or teams that write and submit proposals for each Cardano Project Catalyst Fund.\nImplementer: Those that turn funded proposals into real projects\nLV0 New Community Reviewers: LV0 Reviewers will be invited to review up to 30 proposals and will be allocated an initial set of proposals to review based on proposals across the entire fund (they won t be able to choose specific proposals).\nLV1 Experienced Community Reviewers: After being a successful LV0 Reviewer, this means participating in at least 1 fund in this capacity. A person can become an LV1 Reviewer and be invited to review up to 80 proposals. These will be allocated from the initial set of proposals to review based on challenge preferences selected during the registration process.\nLV2 Community Moderators: The final level for community reviewers. Community Moderators are asked to decide whether reviews that were flagged by the Catalyst scripts should be published or discarded altogether. People in this role do not score proposals. After successfully working as a LV1 Community Reviewer an invitation will be extended to become a Community Moderator.\nVoter: those who register and vote on proposals.\nEach fund on the Catalyst platform follows the same structure:\nProposal Submission\nSubmissions are open for three weeks, during which proposers can submit draft ideas to IdeaScale. The deadline for proposal submission is on July 13th at 11:00 UTC and it s open now.\nAfter July 13th, proposers can take all the feedback given by the community and edit their ideas, this window lasts for four days until July 17th, after which, it s no longer possible to make changes. The three categories used to score ideas are:\nThere is more information regarding the criteria here.\nCommunity Review\nCommunity Reviewers registration opens on June 29th. They must score all proposals based on the predetermined criteria shown above. Both LV0 and LV1 reviewers are active during this period, and they must complete their assigned workload to receive rewards. LV0 reviewers must score the 30 assigned proposals and LV1 reviewers must score 80 proposals.\nTo be a successful reviewer, none of their reviews should be flagged by the Project Catalyst system. If a review by a Community Reviewer is flagged and later the Community Moderators strike it down, the rewards won t be delivered. The possible offenses are listed here.\nThe score goes from 1 to 5 stars for each of the three categories. The overall proposal score is the average of the three criteria. It s important to remember that Community Reviewers will be assigned proposals to review, it s no longer possible to choose which ones to score.\nCommunity Voting\nCommunity voting is done via registration which is done using the official Project Catalyst app. To vote on Catalyst you need at least 500 ADA, excluding rewards. If you registered for any previous fund, the registration will carry to Fund 10, but you won t be able to get rewards from voting. The recommendation is to register again and that way be eligible to receive rewards.\nProject Onboarding\nThe results from votes are tallied and published on the Project Catalyst site. From there, the successful teams are contacted and given instructions on how they must report their progress.\n*Times are subject to change so please monitor https://projectcatalyst.io/\nCommunity members are eligible to register to vote for Project Catalyst rounds through Yoroi Wallet.\nIf you have a minimum of 500 ADA in your Yoroi Wallet at the time of the snapshot, you are eligible to register to vote for Project Catalyst proposals.\nView instructions for registering to vote with Yoroi Wallet here.\nAbout EMURGO Academy\nAbout EMURGO\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.

    "instruction": "The Basics of Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe Cardano EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "October 19, 2023\nEMURGO\nFor Cardano blockchain developers, it can be a little confusing at first due to the different languages of Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe present in Cardano. This blog explains the differences between each one, the role each occupies, and how they build on each other when building on Cardano.\nAs an open-source, decentralized blockchain with fast and secure transactions with predictable fees and other unique features, Cardano is one of the most versatile smart contract blockchains for developers to build dApps. Cardano is also the first public blockchain to be built upon scientific peer review and cryptographic research methods. With this in mind, Cardano delivers a multi-faceted smart contract platform to meet the varying Web3 demands of blockchain developers, enterprises, and entrepreneurs.\nIn Cardano, the computer language Haskell and the two domain-specific languages Plutus and Marlowe serve as programming tools to provide a multidimensional view to cater to different user demands. These languages each have a role to play when it comes to production development, but they also reinforce each other.\nMore on each below.\nHaskell is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language. It s based on Lambda Calculus, an alternative to Turing machines, a formal mathematical system for expressing the notion of computations.\nHaskell has been at the forefront of functional programming ever since its inception in 1990. It has seen a lot of adoption when it comes to building critical systems in the financial world and for different space agencies as it offers strong security properties when it comes to designing complex systems.\nIn Cardano, Haskell is at the core of the entire network.\nThe Cardano node was written in Haskell and most of the architecture that underpins the inner workings of the blockchain is all in Haskell code. Anyone looking to work at the lower levels of the network by necessity requires a strong knowledge of Haskell.\nOf course, most Cardano blockchain developers won t go that deep when creating dApps. Yet, Haskell plays an important role for them as well. As we said before, off-chain code is a major component of any dApp. This piece of a smart contract can be written in Haskell when using tools such as the Plutus Application Backend (PAB) from IOG or Atlas.\nRead more: Becoming an off-chain Cardano developer\nSecurity and performance gains can be achieved when using Haskell for the off-chain code even though it s not the only option as we have seen in previous articles in this series.\nHaskell is the language that supports the entire Cardano network. It s a major component of the blockchain even for those blockchain developers not looking to use it when designing dApps. For this reason, a basic knowledge of the language is important for anyone jumping to Cardano.\nPlutus is a domain-specific language created to write on-chain code for Cardano. As we discussed previously, a dApp on Cardano is divided between on and off-chain code, the former also called a validator.\nThe main language to write the on-chain portion of a smart contract is Plutus. The language borrows most of the syntax and properties of Haskell and also inherits many of the security features of its parent language.\nThis means that having a basic knowledge of Haskell will not only help with writing Plutus code but also help reinforce the knowledge of both languages. Most of the principles that come from functional programming in Haskell are what make Plutus code secure when it comes to smart contracts.\nConcretely, Plutus is the language blockchain developers use to code the business logic the Cardano network needs to validate. The on-chain code is the set of rules that make dApps public and immutable, as it is this code that the nodes on Cardano execute when users interact with dApps.\nRead more: How to become an on-chain Cardano developer\nThe dApps on Cardano rely on Plutus to secure this business logic, prevent attacks from happening, and govern the behavior of crypto assets. It has enormous importance in the ecosystem for all of those reasons.\nThe language Plutus will be the main tool for Cardano blockchain developers. It s the most supported way to write validators and EMURGO, IOG, and the Cardano Foundation have spent a lot of time writing documentation for this language.\nIt has the most support in the ecosystem and it will continue to improve as more features are added to support it. As Plutus is not an ecstatic product, but one that gathers continuous feedback from the community to further introduce improvements.\nMarlowe is another domain-specific language for Cardano. It s also used to design validators (on-chain) and allow them to deploy this business logic to the network. The main difference between Marlowe and Plutus is that the former was created to be more friendly and intuitive using visual constructs instead of abstract pieces of coding logic.\nMarlowe uses a graphical interface where smart contract concepts such as transfer, amount, deposit, etc. are represented by graphical puzzle pieces. Each piece has a logical set of connections that are required for the logic to be valid.\nThe interface can be used to create most of the basic financial applications found in blockchain technology. Plus, by using the logic of the system, more complex functionalities can be composed from the individual pieces.\nMarlowe was designed to allow projects to easily develop and deploy on-chain code. It aims to lower the barrier and open the power of blockchain to teams that may not have the ability to find a full-time Cardano blockchain developer.\nAdditionally, the backend of Marlowe is also using the principles of Haskell. Any validator designed using Marlowe can be converted from the visual of pieces joined together to 100 valid Haskell code.\nThis makes it a powerful teaching tool for Haskell and by extension Plutus. Future students can freely compose a validator using the graphical interface and then transform that into code. That way they can see how the represented pieces translate to Plutus and use it as a reference.\nIn this way, learning Marlowe reinforced Plutus and Haskell principles. All three major languages on Cardano interlink and build on top of each other.\nEnroll now\nCardano founding entity EMURGO s education unit, EMURGO Academy, has created specially tailored programs that aim to train future Cardano blockchain developers. These courses go through all the necessary Haskell principles, Plutus development, and real examples using Marlowe.\nIt s designed to take programmers from other fields and give them the necessary tools to be competent Cardano developers.

    "instruction": "The Programming Languages Behind Cardano OnChain Code EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "February 2, 2024\nEMURGO\nIn a previous blog, we discussed the specialized role of the on-chain Cardano blockchain developer responsible for writing on-chain code for a Cardano dApp that gets deployed to the blockchain and executed by the nodes in the network. To write this on-chain code, Cardano developers can use different programming languages.\nThe Cardano network was made to be versatile and inclusive. It chose Haskell as its core language, but at the same time, it created the tools to open the network for any alternative. The push is to enable various possible solutions while ensuring the same level of security.\nThis has created a very special ecosystem for Cardano, one where there are multiple alternatives to writing on-chain code without compromising the security of the blockchain. This is virtually unheard of on other protocols.\nEach of these languages is an alternative to the on-chain code which compiles to Plutus Core and this means each of these alternatives benefits from the Plutus Virtual Machine that interprets Plutus Core. It is important to note that only PlutusTx actually has a formally verified compiler.\nOther languages like Aiken are also widely used and tested and is used for many of the most popular dApps in the Cardano ecosystem.\nAs such, it s a matter of preference which one to use and not so much about properties that make them better than each other.\nLet s look at the different programming languages for Cardano on-chain code below.\nOne way to write smart contracts on the list is PlutusTx, which is a compiler plugin for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (the mainstream Haskell compiler), with the main language being in Haskell.\nIt s the supported method to write on-chain code by the team at IOG. It s a domain-specific language that was created based on Haskell and as such mirrors the syntax of its parent language almost 1-to-1.\nPlutusTx is the main method that is backed by the team at IOG and support from the other founding entities. It has ample support in some areas, but also lacks comprehensive documentation and resources in the Cardano ecosystem compared to other alternatives such as Aiken. It has already received a major overhaul after the Vasil hard fork and the introduction of PlutusV2.\nIn the future, this pattern is expected to continue. The core developers will improve the features of Plutus and other teams will have to catch up with their changes. This is why it s recommended to learn Plutus for everyone looking to enter Cardano development.\nAiken is one of the alternatives to PlutusTx.\nAiken is inspired by some of the most familiar languages for developers and has quickly evolved into a friendly tool for Cardano developers.\nIt was made in response to a need for a functional programming language in Cardano and enables developers to build dApps quickly and easily.\nBorn from TxPipe and with support from the Cardano Foundation, Aiken has been adopted by the community as a popular smart contract language.\nIt is a very popular alternative to the original PlutusTx with its clear documentation, end-to-end examples, and vibrant community. There is a sizable pool of developers who understand functional programming with a background in TypeScript, Python, Java, and Go, which can quickly onboard to the Aiken way of doing things. Aiken has allowed them to enter the Cardano ecosystem using a language that uses some familiar concepts for them.\nAdditionally, Aiken provides some gains on execution units which directly correlate to the number of steps and memory that a contract can do on-chain. There are fewer steps to finish an instruction in Aiken which makes for more efficient validators. It s the size that determines the fee amount, so any gains on that area make transactions and therefore by extension dApps cheaper to use.\nThe Helios language is a Javascript/Typescript SDK alternative for on-chain code on Cardano.\nIt was created to onboard web developers onto Cardano. The Javascript/Typescript ecosystem is among the largest among programmers and Helios is a good option for these people.\nThe Helios toolkit also has the distinction of working for both on-chain and off-chain code! The creators of Helios have developed a version for each of the sides of a Cardano dApp. So, developers no longer need to use one type of language for on-chain and then switch to a different one for off-chain.\nThe Helios language can also be used to calculate and manage Cardano assets during a transaction. This makes it one of the most versatile alternatives in the Cardano ecosystem for programmers of all backgrounds.\nOpshin is a language that uses 100 valid Python code for on-chain logic on Cardano.\nIt s the main alternative for those looking to build on the network that have a background in Python. There is a large community of data analysts that come from Python that can benefit from this alternative.\nThe language is easy to install and start to use for those familiar with Python. It supports both imperative and functional paradigms without compromising the core design of Cardano smart contracts.\nPlu-ts developed by Harmonic Labs is another Typescript alternative for on-chain code.\nThe implementation of the language also provides tools to write off-chain code, so it allows developers the ability to use the same syntax for both portions of the Cardano dApp.\nAdditionally, Plu-ts aims to give developers more control over the compiled code. This means the size of a smart contract can be optimized to make it cheaper for the user. This means dApp developers can further push Plu-ts to make their platforms cheaper to use.\nPlutarch is another domain-specific language albeit only for on-chain code based on Haskell. It is considered a higher level of abstraction when related to Haskell, which gives developers ways to write highly efficient smart contracts. But these are harder to reason about due to the level of abstraction in Plutarch.\nThe main objective of it is to optimize the size of a validator to make transactions as cheap as possible. At the moment, Plutarch is the language that proves the smallest validators for Cardano dApps.\nThis has made Plutarch the first choice for dApps that want to optimize their fees as much as possible. It s an advanced option for developers proficient with Haskell, as it relies more on the core features of its parent language than other alternatives. For this reason, it s not very beginner-friendly, but certainly a viable choice for Haskell veterans.\nThere we have an almost comprehensive list of all the different ways to write on-chain code on Cardano. Except for PlutusTx, all the other projects were created by the community and are supported by independent teams.\nAll of them share the same core security properties and don t compromise Cardano in any way. This means that the choice of which one to use comes from the experience of a developer team. All of the choices are 100 viable and each is being improved constantly by the Cardano community.\nEMURGO is a global blockchain technology company that supports builders, organizations, and others to adopt Cardano for Web3 products and services.\nTo receive updates on Cardano and EMURGO, follow EMURGO on X (formerly Twitter) for details about the latest announcements, Cardano education courses, project funding, Cardano-related events, and more.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "5 Things to Build With Blockchain Developer Education EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "February 15, 2024\nEMURGO\nReceiving quality blockchain education provides the foundational building blocks for interested developers and business professionals to start building and/or working with blockchain-based products and services (other times referred to as Web3 products and services). Blockchain technology, mainly decentralized blockchain technology, can be considered a financial technology and this means that blockchain has unlocked many possibilities for developers and entrepreneurs to launch decentralized products that have an immediate global reach.\nThe key to being able to do this is quality blockchain education.\nMany types of decentralized financial services such as remittances, payments, borrowing, lending, and other services such as authentication, asset tokenization, etc. can be launched on top of a decentralized blockchain network such as Cardano.\nAnyone on the planet with an internet connection is also able to create these things without restrictions. The amount of freedom blockchain technology affords to individuals and groups of developers is unprecedented.\nIn this blog, we ll go over some examples of decentralized products & services or applications that can be built by having a blockchain developer education and which can then become a launchpad for bigger blockchain projects.\nHere are some different blockchain projects to build below.\nNFTs or non-fungible tokens started gaining popularity a few years ago as uniquely verifiable digital representations of assets such as music, art, video, and more, that are issued and recorded on a decentralized blockchain.\nWith a basic blockchain developer education, you can build an NFT drop.\nThis is one of the easiest blockchain projects an entry-level blockchain developer can build and can be completed early in the career of a blockchain developer. It not only helps with developing your developer portfolio but also serves as a career launchpad for more complex projects.\nThe NFT drop consists of creating a collection of NFTs. There are two parts to an NFT:\nFirst, we have the token. This means that the asset is going to be recorded in the decentralized blockchain ledger. An NFT token is a type of asset that has no decimals, it cannot be broken down into smaller chunks, and each token in the supply has a unique ID that separates them from the whole.\nThe main decision to take in at this level is the total supply. In most cases, developers chose to have a round number that can be easily tracked. The average size for an NFT collection is around 10,000 units or tokens.\nSecond, is the artwork and metadata. The images most associated with the NFT are not stored directly on the blockchain. They are saved in either decentralized storage networks (IPFS, Arweave, Sia Tech, etc.) or in traditional databases. Then a unique identifier called a hash of the image is generated and referenced in the metadata of the token. In Cardano, the metadata is stored on the network, with one hash of an image per token in the NFT collection.\nNext, the metadata information is required. Once the hash of the image is completed, the rest needs to be decided. In most cases, there is a reference to the rarity of the attributes in the NFT, such as the date it was created, the name of the collection, and other details. The NFT s metadata can be freely crafted to reflect the uniqueness of a collection.\nOnce all of the pieces are in place, the NFT collection can be sold on any of the marketplaces on the Cardano network. This concludes the life cycle of this type of project.\nRead more: EMURGO Academy explains NFTs and blockchain metadata\nAnother type of small blockchain project that can be completed after completing a blockchain developer education course is building a lending smart contract.\nIts job is to take one cryptocurrency or token and lock it in a smart contract, serving as collateral. Once the collateral asset is provided, the contract releases another crypto asset as a loan for the user.\nThe contract then has to track the time since the loan was taken. The loan has a pre-established interest rate that is computed along with the time and the loan amount to give the user how much it s needed to pay back.\nOnce the user pays back the loan amount plus the accumulated interest, the original collateral is released back to the user s wallet. If not, the remaining debt is liquidated and the collateral is given as a reward to whoever pays the loan.\nThis type of logic is one of the basic building blocks of DeFi (decentralized finance). The project touches on many of the most used smart contract primitives such as time-locked logic, time tracking, and interest rate management. It can be the perfect launchpad for a DeFi platform.\nRead more: How to start using DeFi\nThe yield smart contract is a DeFi platform where users lock their assets in a smart contract which in turn gives them a percentage gain based on the amount deposited. It is a mid-level product that can make blockchain developers familiar with smart contract design, wallet integration, front-end layout for a DeFi product, and user security.\nIt also couples perfectly with the collateral lending smart contract as it can give rewards to those users who provided liquidity for the loans. By doing this, it can give a higher yield to those participating in the lending marketplace and incentivize more participation.\nThis can quickly be the basis of a small DeFi platform that can bridge bigger DeFi projects with a team of developers. It s a great way to learn about DeFi and also start creating a bigger DeFi platform with more use cases.\nRead more: 5 promising real use cases for DeFi\nAnother mid-level project is a voting system using smart contracts. Many crypto projects use DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) tools to operate, of which the most basic type of tool is voting. It uses a token to represent the voting rights of each member of the organization. The platform creates a poll and users choose from the alternatives with their tokens as the basis for voting.\nThis type of platform needs wallet integration and also the ability to read the balance of a particular token from the wallet. Only one asset can be used as a voting right, so the platform should only consider that one asset.\nThis need to query token balance from a wallet address directly from the blockchain makes this project a little more difficult than the previous ones. It s a great stepping stone to more complex decentralized applications, in particular those that have to retrieve information from the blockchain in real time.\nA project with much more complexity is a decentralized NFT marketplace. This means that the sale and purchase of the tokens should be managed by smart contracts and not by custodial systems. This type of platform requires several smart contracts working together to achieve the goal.\nIt s also one where the team needs to decide on several settings for the platform such as the fee charged by the marketplace if it allows for royalties on resales, minting of NFTs by users, and many other platform configurations.\nIt s an advanced-level project and one that it s almost impossible to complete alone. In most cases, a group of developers need to band together and take on portions of the platform to finish in a relatively short time. Yet, it s a project that once completed showcases the knowledge of a developer team.\nAre you new to blockchain and Cardano and want to learn the basics about becoming a blockchain developer?\nEMURGO Academy, the education unit of global blockchain technology company EMURGO, provides comprehensive and tailored blockchain education courses to interested developers and business professionals, with new cohorts consistently starting.

    "input": "",
    "output": "May 23, 2023\nEMURGO\nA Behind-the-Scenes with Dima Kuznets, Product Designer for Yoroi Wallet\nJoin us for an interview with our UX/UI designer Dima Kuznets for a glimpse into how the Yoroi Wallet came to be and learn about some of its unique features.\nWhat is your background before joining EMURGO?\nDima: I have been working in product design for more than 5 years. I ve created various custom large-scale interface solutions for companies including Big Four accounting firms, WPP the world s #1 multinational ad company, several Fortune 500 companies, and several leading automotive brands. I m passionate about public initiatives, volunteering, and education. My volunteering efforts include assisting in the creation of the Kyiv Map of Renovation (a platform that helps preserve the historical heritage of Ukraine s capital city), supporting charitable funds, and mentoring students in design school.\nDescribe your role at EMURGO and describe your role in building the Yoroi Wallet.\nDima: I m a Product Designer at EMURGO. When it comes to the Yoroi Wallet, my responsibilities include:\nWhat purpose does the Yoroi Wallet play in the larger Cardano ecosystem?\nDima: Yoroi is the first light wallet in the ecosystem to demonstrate to the entire community that the crypto experience can be much faster and easier than the status quo. Instead of installing and maintaining complex full-node wallets like Daedalus, users can add, send, receive, and stake ADA with significantly less effort and immediate results.\nBecause Yoroi is being created in the open by EMURGO, one of the founding entities of Cardano, it plays a significant role in the ecosystem by providing a safe transparent place for users funds following the highest blockchain standards. Additionally, our open-source wallet has been a reference point for other project owners building wallet-adjacent products and infrastructure. Our product design team continues to work diligently to provide a top-notch user experience transparently.\nWhat kind of research did you/the team conduct before building the wallet? Did you identify any features you liked or that you felt were missing that you wanted to bring to the user experience for Cardano users?\nDima: Light wallets are great because they can run on many types of devices, notably smartphones. Users can experience all the advantages of the Cardano network without their device slowing them down or adding any extra complications. The EMURGO product, design, and tech teams performed market, user, and financial research before building Yoroi. We spent hundreds of hours in collaborative workshops for ideation, alignment, and synthesis. We also held regular retrospective sessions to understand what we were missing and what we could improve as a team. I strongly believe that a well-organized team is a key driver for success.\nAt a time when the Cardano network is rapidly developing, new DeFi solutions are quickly appearing, and customer needs are swiftly growing, Yoroi is poised to completely revise the wallet experience from tech-oriented to user-oriented. We are focusing on the integration of highly demanded features, such as an NFT gallery, native swap functions, and more advanced staking. Yoroi will continue to evolve as the team continues to predict and respond to the community s wants and needs. We ll also ensure to keep all the things that make Yoroi compliant with the highest web3 security standards.\nWhat features have you added to make Yoroi more approachable for new users?\nDima: Most noticeably, we have simplified the interface, shifting from the typical tech-oriented error-based interface to one that is user-oriented. Every feature both standard wallet features that have been redesigned for Yoroi, and new features unique to the wallet is provided with well-thought-out design solutions based on market best practices and community feedback. User testing sessions and surveys encourage users to get involved in the process of creating a perfect tool for their daily crypto operations.\nRight now, Yoroi provides most of the required functions in the main navigation screen, making them always visible to the user, and each specific feature has its own unique and consistent internal navigation and structure. The ability to quickly hide your balance everywhere makes it safer to use Yoroi in public places. The color design, calm grayscale colors combined with the blue Yoroi brand, makes the wallet unique and memorable.\nHow will Yoroi save users time?\nDima: Our key design goal was to help users perform tasks with fewer actions, less interface load, and more personalization. We want our users to access and use their wallets more efficiently. With Yoroi, creating, restoring, and connecting wallets, as well as transaction speed, will become super fast and even more intuitive. Users will also enjoy a more personalized experience, which will include additional settings, contextual hints, and a certain level of customization.\nWas Yoroi designed for Web3 newcomers, hardcore DeFi traders, NFT collectors, or someone else? What balance did you strike between simplicity and capability?\nDima: Right now, Yoroi is designed primarily for power users, but we want to make Yoroi 2.0 accessible to everyone. Customization is important to us. While some extra settings might help hardcore DeFi traders and NFT collectors fulfill their needs faster, they can also be a real burden for Web3 newcomers. So we are striving to make the interface adjustable, as per users needs, and make Yoroi an iconic crypto wallet for everyone even those who don t know what crypto is. Designing Yoroi 2.0 to be inclusive will help us to grow the community and give users the ability to grow from using the basics to leveraging advanced DeFi features.\nRead more: How EMURGO Product Designer Dima transitioned his career to Cardano\nAre there any unique UX features introduced by Yoroi that you d like to highlight?\nDima: Although we are just at the beginning of Yoroi 2.0, features such as the wallet dashboard on Yoroi mobile and the NFT gallery provide faster and simpler navigation, more approachable key functions, and great value to our users. Yoroi also stands out by automating the collateral process (a process that ensures transactions execute successfully). Rather than requiring users to manually lock up the necessary amount of ADA, Yoroi will automatically take the amount required for collateral from existing UTXOs. This feature enhances our user experience when interacting with Cardano dApps.\nThe new staking dashboard, which includes separated sections on the web, helps users better navigate the staking process. We also made the wallet restoration process extremely fast and easy. When entering a phrase, users can use traditional keyboard shortcuts to speed up the process. This is just the start of our revamp journey and we ll be releasing dozens of cool updates pretty soon.\nHow will EMURGO leverage its native wallet to provide a more seamless experience for the Cardano community? Tell us about some of the synergies between Yoroi and other EMURGO offerings.\nDima: EMURGO Fintech s solutions are built to increase connectivity across the blockchain and traditional financial services ecosystems, beginning with the Cardano network. These financial services products will harness the value and full potential of the Cardano blockchain for our community.\nEMURGO s Yoroi Wallet is working on integrating with many well-known DApps and DEXes, which will help consolidate all DeFi activities in one place with the top level of security. Our users already enjoy interaction with some of Cardano s popular DEXs and dApps like Minswap, Muesliswap, NMKR and Taptools, and so on. In the meantime, EMURGO s USDA stablecoin & Yoroi Wallet integration will help to bridge the gap between the fiat and crypto worlds, allowing people to exchange their native coins for fiat and vice versa in minutes and with the lowest fees.\nWant to connect to the greater Cardano ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and other dApps?\nWant to easily send, receive, store, and stake ADA?

    "instruction": "Becoming a Cardano Blockchain Frontend Developer EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "October 10, 2023\nEMURGO\nIn this Cardano blockchain developer roadmap blog series, we look at the different types of developer roles for the Cardano ecosystem. In our previous blogs, we discussed the need for developer specializations in Cardano and explained on-chain and off-chain Cardano developer roles.\nIn this blog, we discuss the frontend blockchain developer role. The frontend is one of the most crucial portions of a dApp as it s the piece of technology most users will interact with regularly.\nA good application frontend can make or break a project. It s also the main way a blockchain developer connects with web development. Most of the web tech stack is also present in the world of blockchain and many blockchain developers start their careers as web developers for Web3 or even Web2 projects.\nThe frontend in this case refers to a webpage. In the world of web development, a frontend is much more than websites, but for blockchain technology, most dApps are mainly served via a browser.\nThe traditional tools of web development are very much in use in the world of blockchain. The main languages for this are Javascript and Typescript. Each has been a big part of the blockchain ecosystem for a long time.\nThe most popular frameworks like Vue.js and React are the main ways to create responsive web pages. Most projects have a high demand for developers familiar with these tools and they can easily break into the industry by knowing how to use them.\nFinally, most projects use the Node Package Manager (npm) for these projects. It s the standard, but recently Deno a competitor of npm made by some of the same developers has gained a lot of traction in the industry.\nThose tools should be familiar to anyone with some knowledge of web development. They are applied to the blockchain world in the same way or with very little difference.\nSo, what are the specific requirements for blockchain development?\nThe tools mentioned are the same as normal web development.\nThe key difference in the case of blockchain development is connecting with the blockchain and allowing crypto wallets to form and execute transactions.\nThose are the two pieces of technology that differ from what most web developers are familiar with. Let s go over what this means\nTo have a functional dApp, the frontend needs to have information from the blockchain displayed to the user. This requires the frontend to actively query data from the network and show it on demand.\nThis is the job of the node or server. In blockchain, a node is a system that downloads the entire ledger and syncs with the network as it moves from state to state. The node actively participates as it downloads the latest block to the local system.\nSince the node has a copy of the latest state of the ledger locally, it can serve as a relay point. The frontend developer can quickly set up points of connection and receive the requested information.\nOf course, nodes have demanding hardware requirements and also need a lot of configuration. This has led to an industry of providers that quickly serve API points for dApps to use and that way developers can avoid having to set up a local node. Some of these are:\nProbably other services provide similar capabilities, but these three are the most popular. The use of APIs is common in web development, so using these services should be familiar to people from that industry.\nThe other major component of a frontend is the wallet connector. This means having a way for a crypto wallet to connect to a site for it to relay information to the backend. Finally, it communicates the instructions to the blockchain, and the transaction is recorded.\nThe wallet connector acts as the main interface between the user and the dApp. It s the wallet that has control over the user s private key and only with its authorization, a transaction can be forwarded.\nThe wallet connector also has to account for the myriad of different wallets that exist on Cardano including Yoroi, an open-source and the first light wallet for Cardano ADA holders.\nAll the requirements to connect dApps to wallets are specified in CIP-30, given its complexity many projects have developed ways to manage this piece of the dApp.\nThe Cardano ecosystem moves rapidly so new projects may also come with solutions for this piece of the dApp. For now, the two mentioned above are among the most widely adopted and have been servicing many of the projects on Cardano.\nEMURGO Academy, the education unit of Cardano founding entity EMURGO, has created a specialized Cardano blockchain developer program that includes both Cardano node and wallet connector classes. It is designed to take web developers through the familiar grounds and introduce the new concepts specific to blockchain gradually to learn skills to become a Cardano frontend developer.\nCardano continues to be one of the biggest decentralized blockchain networks in the industry with many dApps for DeFi, NFTs, and more.\nTo start your career as a blockchain developer working on the Cardano ecosystem, visit EMURGO Academy and sign up for the course right for you.\nAbout EMURGO\nDisclaimer\nYou should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "instruction": "How to Start Getting Involved With DeFi EMURGO?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "January 5, 2024\nEMURGO\nDeFi (decentralized finance), which leverages decentralized blockchains, has grown quickly in new products, services, and users over the past few years. TVL (Total Value Locked) is a common metric to measure the amount of value within DeFi and has been in the tens of billions of dollars. Since blockchain and crypto itself are relatively new, DeFi which itself is an ecosystem within blockchain, is even newer.\nBuilders continue to build new products and features for DeFi which enable open access to peer-to-peer financial services utilizing crypto. Users gain awareness of blockchain, then DeFi, and start to experiment and learn about its future potential. Thus, the DeFi ecosystem is one filled with opportunities for those willing to enter it provided they are aware of its risks and benefits.\nAs DeFi is a nascent space, there is a potential risk because DeFi services use open-source software protocols built on decentralized blockchains. This can pose financial risks when trading assets, and also security risks when it comes to using DeFi products/applications that can have technical bugs and flaws that can steal user funds locked in these products/applications.\nHowever, there are certain ways to mitigate some of these risks by being aware of certain aspects before getting involved with DeFi. But, a user must always be aware that there are no guarantees of rewards and must balance potential risk with potential rewards.\nIn this blog, we ll outline some of the basic strategies you can use to start learning DeFi and have a stronger knowledge base.\nDeFi is a very broad space, and also part of the blockchain industry, which is even bigger. Before we start, it ll be useful to delineate where the DeFi space starts properly, at least how this article will define it.\nBy DeFi, we mean interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) that use decentralized blockchain-based smart contracts to validate business logic. These dApps don t have intermediaries and utilize smart contracts to secure user funds.\nThe business logic of these dApps runs on top of a distributed or decentralized blockchain such as Cardano or Ethereum. That rules out any financial product running on top of a blockchain built by a centralized crypto exchange or one issued by a private company.\nDeFi runs the gamut from straightforward applications to complex financial systems. The best way to start is to dip your toes in DeFi by identifying a few simpler and common strategies that not only showcase the power of DeFi but also help to build experience in the field.\nCommon sense would also dictate that you start by experimenting with a small amount to get familiar with certain DeFi features. Remember that any strategy still carries user risks and is not a guarantee of 100 security, but are just some of the more common basic ways to start getting involved with DeFi.\nLet s look at a few of these basic and common strategies:\nThis might seem to be common sense again, but it is a very basic strategy to get started with DeFi. In this context, DYOR means checking the legitimacy of the dApp s website and URL, security history, user base, TVL, and other comments made by its users in online communities and social media such as X.\nWhat are people saying online? Have there been any major security breaches? Has the dApp been security audited? Who is the developer behind the dApp? Is the URL verified? How many users does the dApp have? Is there a significant amount of TVL? How do I connect a wallet and funds/tokens?\nAsk yourself these questions first and take the time to do your own research before committing any funds to a DeFi dApp.\nThe most straightforward DeFi strategy is to stake tokens or crypto to gain yield over time. It s the most basic of strategies because calculating the profit of a staking platform is very simple. It s the interest offered over the period of time the asset is staked.\nIn most cases for tokens, the locking period forbids the withdrawal of the asset. This means that during a downturn in the price, it s not possible to remove it from the smart contract and sell it. This is not true for every type of staking smart contract, but most of them require a locking period.\nCardano and its native crypto ADA are unique because staking is liquid and self-custodial. A user s staked ADA can be removed at any point, so the risks of this strategy are reduced dramatically.\nNext, we have another simple DeFi strategy that can be used for those unfamiliar with the space. It s minting stablecoins using an algorithm to create a peg with the US dollar.\nStablecoins use a cryptocurrency as a reserve to mint stablecoins. These are permissionless assets and can be minted by anyone. In most cases, the reserve requirements have to be above the created amount of the stablecoin, also known as over-collateralization.\nFor example, to mint 100 dollars of stablecoin, a user would need to provide 160 in a cryptocurrency. In our case, it would be ADA that provides the asset for the reserve and becomes the collateral posted.\nAgain, with this strategy, the only variable is the amount of the reserve required. The risk is that if the ADA falls in price and the original amount is not enough to maintain the collateral required, the contract enters into liquidation. A user must be aware of this risk.\nThis strategy allows users to familiarize themselves with algorithmic stablecoins, collateral requirements, and liquidations. The stablecoins themselves don t provide any sort of yield, but they can be used in the rest of the DeFi ecosystem while the reserves are to be maintained at a level above the liquidation threshold.\nAnother strategy is providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX) pool. It s a strategy that involves locking a pair of tokens by adding a 50/50 supply of the pair to the chosen liquidity pool. By providing liquidity to the pool, the user gains a portion of the fees when people trade that specific pair of tokens.\nThere is risk in this strategy in that the liquidity provider is affected by impermanent loss, which is a phenomenon that happens when one of the tokens in the pair rapidly loses its value. At that moment, the liquidity provider has a larger amount of the less valuable token.\nIf the liquidity provider removes the liquidity, then the loss is incurred and becomes a concrete loss. If the user leaves the token in the pool, and later the token recovers its value up to the original amount, then the loss is erased. Of course, there is no guarantee the token will ever recover.\nThat s the reason why providing liquidity is a much more advanced strategy. The liquidity provider not only needs to factor in the fees as a source of profit but also the risk of the assets falling in price, which can be very difficult.\nBut it remains a strategy for those starting in DeFi.\nEnroll now!\nEMURGO and the Institute of Blockchain Singapore are collaborating to host a 2-day workshop on DeFi for business and finance professionals in Singapore in January 2024.\nThis 2-day DeFi workshop aims to provide you with a comprehensive overview of both blockchain and DeFi, enabling participants to make informed decisions, participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and contribute to the growth of DeFi.

    "input": "",
    "output": "May 23, 2022\nAlbert Kim\nCardano is a decentralized, proof-of-stake blockchain that is secured and governed by the 3 million+ global ADA community, and provides an environmentally-sustainable platform for Web3 decentralized applications (dApps) development.\nAs an open-source and transparent blockchain, Cardano s development is a mutual exchange of ideas, proposals, and communication between the Cardano community and the technical development teams, ultimately promoting close collaboration and giving the Cardano community a voice in Cardano s development.\nEMURGO a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain works in tandem with Cardano ecosystem partners Cardano Foundation and IOG to help foster Cardano s development in line with the community s input.\nIn this blog, we will discuss one type of this collaboration and how it helped Yoroi Wallet increase compatibility with Cardano Web3 dApps as a result.\nA Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) is a proposed solution to assist in the evolution of the Cardano ecosystem. It is intended to help improve Cardano s technical development in a transparent manner.\nThe CIP program was launched in 2019 by the Cardano Foundation to offer a collaborative way for the Cardano community to give feedback, propose solutions, and take on an active, engaging role in improving Cardano s overall development.\nUntil now, the CIP program has put forth many proposals which can be found here and on its GitHub.\nEach listed CIP does not constitute that the proposal has been accepted and is being actively worked on, but rather is a compilation of CIPs either reviewed or under review.\nOne CIP that has been accepted is CIP 30 Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge.\nCIP-30 proposes a webpage-based communication bridge allowing webpage dApps to interact with Cardano wallets.\nThis is a much-needed solution that promotes the development of Cardano Web3 dApps and a more efficient onboarding of dApp users by bridging Cardano dApps with new and existing Cardano wallet users.\nSince Cardano dApps will be able to more easily interact with Cardano wallet types, this will help promote the Cardano Web3 ecosystem, including Cardano-based NFT and DeFi dApps, by providing a smoother user experience.\nThe most recent Yoroi Wallet Google Chrome Desktop Extension Version 4.13, has full compatibility with CIP 30.\nThe CIP 30 specification and implementation with Yoroi Wallet is now listed in the Cardano Foundation GitHub repository found here.\nThe new 4.13 version release of Yoroi Wallet Google Chrome Desktop Extension includes the Yoroi dApp Connector which is also CIP-30 compatible. The Yoroi dApp Connector connects to Cardano NFT marketplace Fibo, a one-stop shop that will use Yoroi Google Chrome Desktop Extension to mint, buy, and sell Cardano NFTs.\nYoroi Wallet has implemented CIP-30 to increase compatibility with Cardano Web3 dApps and provide more options for Yoroi Wallet users to connect to Cardano dApp builders and vice versa. For dApps that have already integrated with other Cardano wallets, Yoroi s CIP-30 compatibility now makes it easier to integrate with Yoroi.\nDeveloped by EMURGO the official commercial arm and a founding entity of Cardano blockchain Yoroi is an open-source crypto wallet supporting Cardano ADA and Ergo ERG that provides users with transparency, increased security, and collaboration.\nSince launching in 2018, Yoroi has followed software industry best practices, including a comprehensive security audit, and is carefully engineered to be scalable and robust to accommodate Cardano s growing community.\nYoroi offers both mobile and desktop browser versions for users to store, send, and receive their ADA and ERG cryptocurrencies in addition to staking for passive rewards.\nIf you re developing a dApp on Cardano, reach out to us at info@emurgo.io and our team will get back to you about integrating your dApp with Yoroi Wallet and the CIP-30 integrated dApp Connector.\nYour Cardano dApp has the potential to quickly reach Yoroi Wallet s large user base and receive many other benefits.\nAbout Yoroi Wallet\nAbout EMURGO\nAbout Fibo\nKnowledge - February 11, 2025\nKnowledge - February 6, 2025\nKnowledge - February 4, 2025\nGet the latest updates\n2025 EMURGO.
